genomic regions influencing seminal root traits in barley grain dormancy provides protection against pre-harvest sprouting (phs) in cereals. composite interval mapping and association analyses were performed to identify quantitative trait loci (qtl) contributing grain dormancy in a doubled haploid (dh) barley population (nd24260 × flagship) consisting of 321 lines genotyped with dart markers. harvest-ripe grain collected from three field experiments was germinated over a 7-day period to determine a weighted germination index for each line. dh lines displaying moderate to high levels of grain dormancy were identified; however, both parental lines were non-dormant and displayed rapid germination within the first two days of testing. genetic analysis identified two qtl on chromosome 5h that were expressed consistently in each of the three environments. one qtl (donated by flagship) was located close to the centromeric region of chromosome 5h (qsdflag), accounting for up to 15% of the phenotypic variation. a second qtl with a larger effect (from nd24260) was detected on chromosome 5hl (qsdnd), accounting for up to 35% of the phenotypic variation. qsdflag and qsdnd displayed an epistatic interaction and dh lines that had the highest levels of grain dormancy carried both genes. we demonstrate that qsdnd in the nd24260 × flagship dh population is positioned proximal and independent to the well-characterised sd2 region that is associated with both high levels of dormancy and inferior malt quality. this indicates that it should be possible to develop cultivars that combine acceptable malting quality and adequate levels of grain dormancy for protection against phs by utilizing these alternate qtl.
arachnoid cyst accompanied by proptosis and unilateral high myopia ipsilateral glaucoma developed in a 51-year-old man with a left-sided temporal lobe arachnoidal cyst. ultrasonic examination disclosed a cystic orbital lesion adjacent to the optic nerve. following intracranial decompensation of the arachnoidal cyst, the intraocular pressure dropped markedly. ultrasonography showed a collapse of the presumed optic nerve sheath cyst. while the exact mechanism producing glaucoma in this patient remains unclear, there was an apparent relationship between the elevated intraocular pressure and the arachnoidal cyst.
effects of trail and taurolidine on apoptosis and proliferation in human rhabdomyosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma and epithelioid cell sarcoma. purpose: radiotherapy is commonly used to treat a variety of solid tumors. however, improvements in the therapeutic ratio for several disease sites are sorely needed, leading us to assess molecularly targeted therapeutics as radiosensitizers. the aim of this study was to assess the wee1 kinase inhibitor, mk-1775, for its ability to radiosensitize human tumor cells. experimental design: human tumor cells derived from lung, breast, and prostate cancers were tested for radiosensitization by mk-1775 using clonogenic survival assays. both p53 wild-type and p53-defective lines were included. the ability of mk-1775 to abrogate the radiation-induced g2 block, thereby allowing cells harboring dna lesions to prematurely progress into mitosis, was determined using flow cytometry and detection of γ-h2ax foci. the in vivo efficacy of the combination of mk-1775 and radiation was assessed by tumor growth delay experiments using a human lung cancer cell line growing as a xenograft tumor in nude mice. results: clonogenic survival analyses indicated that nanomolar concentrations of mk-1775 radiosensitized p53-defective human lung, breast, and prostate cancer cells but not similar lines with wild-type p53. consistent with its ability to radiosensitize, mk-1775 abrogated the radiation-induced g2 block in p53-defective cells but not in p53 wild-type lines. mk-1775 also significantly enhanced the antitumor efficacy of radiation in vivo as shown in tumor growth delay studies, again for p53-defective tumors. conclusions: these results indicate that p53-defective human tumor cells are significantly radiosensitized by the potent and selective wee1 kinase inhibitor, mk-1775, in both the in vitro and in vivo settings. taken together, our findings strongly support the clinical evaluation of mk-1775 in combination with radiation. clin cancer res; 17(17); 5638–48. ©2011 aacr.
extracted and depolymerized alginates from brown algae sargassum vulgare of lebanese origin: chemical, rheological, and antioxidant properties in this study, the effects of the molecular weight and ratio of guluronic acid (g) to mannuronic acid (m), g/m, of some sodium alginate (naalg) fractions on their antioxidative properties were investigated. low-molecular-weight-fractions with various g/m were prepared by gamma radiation-induced degradation of naalg. change in their molecular weight was monitored. antioxidant properties of the fractions with various molecular weight and g/m were evaluated by determining the scavenging ability of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl free radical (dpph()). 50% inhibition concentrations of the 50 kgy-irradiated naalgs having molecular weights of 20.5, 17.7, and 16.0 kda were found to be 11.0, 18.0, and 24.0mg/ml, respectively, whereas the fractions of the same molecular weight with a lower g/m exhibited a better dpph() scavenging activity. the results demonstrated that its molecular weight and g/m were important factors in controlling the antioxidant properties of naalg.
a mitochondria-anchored isoform of the actin-nucleating spire protein regulates mitochondrial division masterminding mitochondrial fission mitochondria are highly dynamic and undergo fusion and fission and they move in cells. defects in mitochondrial dynamics are implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases. recent findings have suggested that mitochondrial fission occurs preferentially at endoplasmic reticulum (er) contact sites, with er circumscribing mitochondria and possibly promoting the constriction of mitochondria during fission. korobova et al. (p. 464) now suggest that an er-localized formin, inf2, is required for mitochondrial fission and that inf2-mediated actin polymerization facilitates mitochondrial constriction. actin filaments between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria promote mitochondrial fission. mitochondrial fission is fundamentally important to cellular physiology. the dynamin-related protein drp1 mediates fission, and interaction between mitochondrion and endoplasmic reticulum (er) enhances fission. however, the mechanism for drp1 recruitment to mitochondria is unclear, although previous results implicate actin involvement. here, we found that actin polymerization through er-localized inverted formin 2 (inf2) was required for efficient mitochondrial fission in mammalian cells. inf2 functioned upstream of drp1. actin filaments appeared to accumulate between mitochondria and inf2-enriched er membranes at constriction sites. thus, inf2-induced actin filaments may drive initial mitochondrial constriction, which allows drp1-driven secondary constriction. because inf2 mutations can lead to charcot-marie-tooth disease, our results provide a potential cellular mechanism for this disease state.
role of caveolae in the pathogenesis of cholesterol-induced gallbladder muscle hypomotility. caveolin is a 22-kda protein that appears to play a critical role in regulating the cholesterol concentration of caveolae. even though caveolin is thought to be a membrane protein, several reports suggest that this peculiar protein can traffic independently of membrane vesicles. we now present evidence that a cytosolic pool of caveolin is part of a heat-shock protein-immunophilin chaperone complex consisting of caveolin, heat-shock protein 56, cyclophilin 40, cyclophilin a, and cholesterol. treatment of nih 3t3 cells with 1 microm cyclosporin a or 100 nm rapamycin disrupted the putative transport complex and prevented rapid (10-20 min) transport of cholesterol to caveolae. the lymphoid cell line, l1210-jf, does not express caveolin, does not form an immunophilin-caveolin complex, and does not transport newly synthesized cholesterol to caveolae. transfection of caveolin cdna into l1210-jf cells allowed the assembly of a transport complex identical to that found in nih 3t3 cells. in addition, newly synthesized cholesterol in transfected cells was rapidly (10-20 min) and specifically transported to caveolae. these data strongly suggest that a caveolin-chaperone complex is a mechanism by which newly synthesized cholesterol is transported from the endoplasmic reticulum through the cytoplasm to caveolae.
women-specific hiv/aids services: identifying and defining the components of holistic service delivery for women living with hiv/aids specialized substance abuse treatment programs have been developed for women within the past two decades. this article presents the results of a secondary analysis of a regional database of drug abuse treatment programs that compared the characteristics of women-only (wo) and mixed-gender (mg) programs across three treatment modalities. in general, wo programs differed from mg programs in their policies regarding fees, sources of payment, special populations served, services offered, and treatment capacity, process, and duration. the differences in program characteristics reflect broader societal gender differences, including women's generally lower economic status and primary responsibility for child-rearing.
alternative interventions to prevent oxidative damage following ischemia/reperfusion oxidative stress is considered a major contributor to etiology of both “normal” senescence and severe pathologies with serious public health implications. mitochondria generate reactive oxygen species (ros) that are thought to augment intracellular oxidative stress. mitochondria possess at least nine known sites that are capable of generating superoxide anion, a progenitor ros. mitochondria also possess numerous ros defense systems that are much less studied. studies of the last three decades shed light on many important mechanistic details of mitochondrial ros production, but the bigger picture remains obscure. this review summarizes the current knowledge about major components involved in mitochondrial ros metabolism and factors that regulate ros generation and removal. an integrative, systemic approach is applied to analysis of mitochondrial ros metabolism, which is now dissected into mitochondrial ros production, mitochondrial ros removal, and mitochondrial ros emission. it is suggested that mitochondria augment intracellular oxidative stress due primarily to failure of their ros removal systems, whereas the role of mitochondrial ros emission is yet to be determined and a net increase in mitochondrial ros production in situ remains to be demonstrated.
shi-style cervical manipulations for cervical radiculopathy objective. this paper systematically assessed the efficacy and safety of jingtong granule (jg) for cervical radiculopathy (cr). methods. randomized controlled trials comparing jg with no intervention, placebo, or conventional therapies were retrieved. the trials testing jg combined with conventional therapies versus conventional therapies were also enrolled. study selection, methodological assessment, data extraction, and analysis were conducted in accordance with the cochrane standards. the strength of evidence was evaluated according to grade approach. results. three trials with 400 participants were included. methodological quality was evaluated as generally low. one study found that jg showed significant difference on decreasing pain scores compared with placebo. meta-analysis indicated that jg plus conventional analgesic exhibited a significant immediate effect on the pain scores (wmd = 1.63; 95% ci: 1.29 to 1.98; p < 0.00001). additionally, jg combined with analgesic presented beneficial immediate effect on neck disability index. however, the treatment effects of jg demonstrated in the trials were not large, and the safety of jg was unproven. finally the evidence level was evaluated to be low. conclusions. our results indicated that jg showed some potential benefits for cr. nevertheless, treatment effects are uncertain due to both the methodological concerns and the very modest reported improvements.
scp160p is required for translational efficiency of codon-optimized mrnas in yeast the yeast spindle pole body (spb), the functional equivalent of mammalian centrosome, duplicates in g1/s phase of the cell cycle and then becomes inserted into the nuclear envelope. here we describe a link between spb duplication and targeted translation control. when insertion of the newly formed spb into the nuclear envelope fails, the sesa network comprising the gyf domain protein smy2, the translation inhibitor eap1, the mrna-binding protein scp160 and the asc1 protein, specifically inhibits initiation of translation of pom34 mrna that encodes an integral membrane protein of the nuclear pore complex, while having no impact on other mrnas. in response to sesa, pom34 mrna accumulates in the cytoplasm and is not targeted to the er for cotranslational translocation of the protein. reduced level of pom34 is sufficient to restore viability of mutants with defects in spb duplication. we suggest that the sesa network provides a mechanism by which cells can regulate the translation of specific mrnas. this regulation is used to coordinate competing events in the nuclear envelope.
photorespiratory 2-phosphoglycolate metabolism and photoreduction of o2 cooperate in high-light acclimation of synechocystis sp. strain pcc 6803 the ndhd gene encodes a membrane protein component of nad(p)h dehydrogenase. the genome ofsynechocystis sp. pcc6803 contains 6 ndhdgenes. three mutants were constructed by disrupting highly homologousndhd genes in pairs. only theδndhd1/δndhd2(δndhd1/d2) mutant was unable to grow under photoheterotrophic conditions and exhibited low respiration rate, although the mutant grew normally under photoautotrophic conditions in air. the δndhd3/δndhd4(δndhd3/d4) mutant grew very slowly in air and did not take up co2. the results demonstrated the presence of two types of functionally distinct nad(p)h dehydrogenases in synechocystis pcc6803 cells. theδndhd5/δndhd6(δndhd5/d6) mutant grew like the wild-type strain. under far-red light (>710 nm), the level of p700+was high in δndhd1/d2 and m55 (ndhb-less mutant) at low intensities. the capacity ofq a (tightly bound plastoquinone) reduction by plastoquinone pool, as measured by the fluorescence increase in darkness upon addition of kcn, was much less inδndhd1/d2 and m55 than inδndhd3/d4 andδndhd5/d6. we conclude that electrons from nadph are transferred to the plastoquinone pool mainly by the ndhd1·ndhd2 type of nad(p)h dehydrogenases.
the association between individual snps or haplotypes of matrix metalloproteinase 1 and gastric cancer susceptibility, progression and prognosis purpose matrix metalloproteinase-1 (mmp-1) is likely to be involved in invasion and metastasis of several tumors by degrading the extracellular matrix. a single guanine insertion polymorphism (2g) in the mmp-1 promoter region creates an ets binding site causing the elevation of transcriptional level and local expression of mmp-1. the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of this 2g insertion type polymorphism on invasion and metastasis of colorectal cancer (crc).   experimental design we genotyped for this 1g/2g polymorphism 60 patients, who were operated on for crc and followed for 6-30 months (median: 21). a control population of 164 age- and sex-matched tumor-free subjects was also genotyped for the same polymorphism.   results the proportion of 2g homozygotes was higher in the crc group than in the controls (p = 0.014; odds ratio, 2.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-4.16). the crc group was divided in a group without metastasis (m-) and a group that had developed metastasis (m+). at the time of diagnosis, 2g homozygotes were more represented in the m+ group than in m- (p = 0.0082; odds ratio, 4.73; 95% confidence interval, 1.46-15.26). the difference between m- patients and controls did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.52).   conclusions our results suggest that the presence of 2g polymorphism at the mmp-1 promoter region may favor the growth and the metastatic process in crc patients and could be looked at as a risk factor for a worse prognosis.
a hidden structural vulnerability in the thrombospondin-2 deficient aorta increases the propensity to intramural delamination. thrombospondin 2 (tsp2)-null mice, generated by targeted disruption of the thbs2 gene, display a complex phenotype that is characterized, in part, by a variety of connective tissue abnormalities and increased vascular density in skin and subcutaneous tissues. in this paper we summarize the evidence that tsp2 functions as a matricellular protein to influence cell function by modulating cell-matrix interactions, rather than acting as an integral component of the matrix. thus, the structurally abnormal collagen fibrils detected in skin appear to be the consequence of the defective adhesion demonstrated by dermal fibroblasts in culture that, in turn, result from increased matrix metalloproteinase 2 (mmp2, gelatinase a) production by these cells. corroborating evidence for such a mode of action comes from transmission electron microscopic images of developing flexor muscle tendons that show distinct abnormalities in fibroblast-collagen fibril interactions in tsp2-null tissue. the increased vascular density seen in skin of tsp2-null mice can be reproduced in a number of models of injury, including subcutaneous implantation of polyvinyl alcohol sponges and silicone rubber discs, and excisional skin wounds. experiments are proposed to distinguish between a primarily endothelial cell versus an extracellular matrix origin for the increased angiogenesis in tsp2-null mice.
photobiomodulation therapy for the management of radiation-induced dermatitis purposethe purpose of this study was to review the effect of low-level laser therapy (lllt) in the management of breast cancer-related lymphedema (bcrl).methodsa systematic review of seven databases for clinical trials for lllt in the management of bcrl published between 1990 and 2011 was performed.resultsa total of eight studies on 230 patients were found. the methodological qualities of the selected studies were assessed with the physiotherapy evidence database scale, and the studies were categorized according to sackett’s levels of evidence. five studies were graded at evidence level ii. two studies were graded at evidence level iii, and the remaining study was graded at evidence level v.conclusionsthere is moderate to strong evidence for the effectiveness of lllt for the management of bcrl from five small studies of acceptable methodological quality. a dose of 1–2 j/cm2 per point applied to several points covering the fibrotic area can reduce limb volume following bcrl. further well-designed, large-scale studies are required to determine more precisely how effective lllt may be in bcrl.
let-7b expression determines response to chemotherapy through the regulation of cyclin d1 in glioblastoma the accidental discovery of the anticancer properties of cisplatin and its clinical introduction in the 1970s represent a major landmark in the history of successful anticancer drugs. although carboplatin — a second-generation analogue that is safer but shows a similar spectrum of activity to cisplatin — was introduced in the 1980s, the pace of further improvements slowed for many years. however, in the past several years interest in platinum drugs has increased. key developments include the elucidation of mechanisms of tumour resistance to these drugs, the introduction of new platinum-based agents (oxaliplatin, satraplatin and picoplatin), and clinical combination studies using platinum drugs with resistance modulators or new molecularly targeted drugs.
in vitro growth, pathogenicity and serological characteristics of the japanese encephalitis virus genotype v muar strain. japanese encephalitis virus (jev) genotypes in thailand were studied in pigs and mosquitoes collected near houses of confirmed human jev cases in 2003–2005. twelve jev strains isolated belonged to genotype i, which shows a switch from genotype iii incidence that started during the 1980s.
differences in helicobacter pylori caga tyrosine phosphorylation motif patterns between western and east asian strains, and influences on interleukin-8 secretion. helicobacter pylori is a causative agent of gastritis and peptic ulcer. caga+h. pylori strains are more virulent than caga− strains and are associated with gastric carcinoma. the caga gene product, caga, is injected by the bacterium into gastric epithelial cells and subsequently undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation. the phosphorylated caga specifically binds shp-2 phosphatase, activates the phosphatase activity, and thereby induces morphological transformation of cells. caga proteins of most western h. pylori isolates have a 34-amino acid sequence that variably repeats among different strains. here, we show that the repeat sequence contains a tyrosine phosphorylation site. caga proteins having more repeats were found to undergo greater tyrosine phosphorylation, to exhibit increased shp-2 binding, and to induce greater morphological changes. in contrast, predominant caga proteins specified by h. pylori strains isolated in east asia, where gastric carcinoma is prevalent, had a distinct tyrosine phosphorylation sequence at the region corresponding to the repeat sequence of western caga. this east asian-specific sequence conferred stronger shp-2 binding and morphologically transforming activities to western caga. finally, a critical amino acid residue that determines shp-2 binding activity among different caga proteins was identified. our results indicate that the potential of individual caga to perturb host-cell functions is determined by the degree of shp-2 binding activity, which depends in turn on the number and sequences of tyrosine phosphorylation sites. the presence of distinctly structured caga proteins in western and east asian h. pylori isolates may underlie the strikingly different incidences of gastric carcinoma in these two geographic areas.
the dengue virus in nepal: gaps in diagnosis and surveillance dengue is a global health problem and expansion of its endemics towards new territories in the hilly regions in nepal is a serious concern. it appeared as a new disease in nepal in 2004 from japanese traveler with sporadic cases every year and massive outbreaks in 2010, 2013 and 2016. the serotype was responsible for outbreak in particular year was dengue virus serotype-1 (denv-1) in 2010, 2016; and denv-2 in 2013. nepal lacks basic health related infrastructure in rural areas and does not have a stringent health care policy. with severances of epidemic like dengue, a new surveillance or an upgrading of existing one are direly needed to better challenge the possible outbreaks. this review paper aims to explain the dengue trend in last one decade in nepal and warrants concerted and timely public health interventions to minimize the deleterious effects of the disease.
intrathalline metabolite profiles in the lichen argopsis friesiana shape gastropod grazing patterns lichens are well-suited organisms for experimental herbivory studies because their secondary compounds, assumed to deter grazing, can be non-destructively extracted. thalli of 17 lichen species from various habitats were cut in two equal parts; compounds were extracted from one part by acetone, the other served as a control. these two pieces were offered as a paired choice to the generalist herbivore snail cepaea hortensis. control thalli of all lichens were consumed at a low rate regardless of their investments in acetone-extractable lichen compounds; naturally compound-deficient lichen species were not preferred compared to those with high contents. however, for extracted thalli, there was a highly significant positive correlation between rate of consumption and the extracted compound contents. these data imply that herbivore defence has evolved in different directions in different lichens. studied members of parmeliaceae, common in oligotrophic habitats, have high contents of carbon-rich acetone-soluble compounds; these lichens became highly palatable to snails subsequent to acetone rinsing. extracted lichen compounds were applied to pieces of filter paper and fed to snails. extracts from members of the parmeliaceae significantly deterred feeding on paper. such data suggest that generalist herbivores may have shaped evolution in the widespread and highly diverse parmeliaceae towards high investments in lichen compounds. on the other hand, lichens belonging to the physciaceae and teloschistales, common in nutrient-enriched habitats, are deficient in, or have low concentrations of, lichen compounds. such lichens did not become more palatable after acetone rinsing. the orange anthraquinone compound parietin, restricted to the teloschistales, and which has previously been found to protect against excess light, did not deter grazing.
n-meander scanning trace a method for the on-chip bandwidth reduction this work presents a domain-specific memory subsystem based on a two-level memory hierarchy. it targets the application domain of video post-processing applications including video enhancement and format conversion. these applications are based on motion compensation and/or broad class of content adaptive filtering to provide the highest quality of pictures. our approach meets the required performance and has sufficient flexibility for the application domain. it especially aims at the implementation-wise most challenging applications: compute-intensive and bandwidth-demanding applications that provide the highest quality at high picture resolutions. the lowest level of the memory hierarchy, closest to the processing element, the l0 scratchpad, is organized specifically to enable fast retrieval of an arbitrarily positioned 2-d block of pixels to the processing element. to guarantee the performance, most of its addressing logic is hardwired, leaving a user a set of api for initialization and storing/loading the data to/from the l0 scratchpad. the next level of the memory hierarchy, the l1 scratchpad, minimizes the off-chip memory bandwidth requirements. the l1 scratchpad is organized specifically to enable efficient aligned block-based accesses. with lower data rates compared to the l0 scratchpad and aligned block access, software-based addressing is used to enable full flexibility. the two-level memory hierarchy exploits prefetching to further improve the performance.
role of the glycanases exok and exsh in regulating the molecular weight of the rhizobium meliloti exopolysaccharide succinoglycan summarysymbiotic mutants of rhizobium meliloti were isolated following tn5 mutagenesis. besides four nodulation mutants (nod-) unable to induce nodule formation on alfalfa, five infection mutants (inf-), which induce the formation of root nodules without detectable infection threads or bacteroids, were obtained. the inf- mutants were subdivided into two classes. one class contains mutants which fail to synthesize acidic exopolysaccharide (eps-). the other class is comprised of mutants which produce excess amounts of acidic exopolysaccharide (eps*). 13c nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the exopolysaccharide isolated from one of the latter type of inf- mutant, 101.45, revealed that the side chain of the repeating octosaccharide unit lacks the terminal pyruvate residue. complementing cosmids were isolated for all inf- mutants. in the case of the inf- eps- mutants the complementing cosmids contain dna segments which overlap and are part of megaplasmid 2. for two mutants the mutations were found to map on a 7.8 kb ecori fragment. in the case of the inf- eps* mutants the complementing cosmids carry chromosomal dna. the mutations of two inf- eps* mutants were localized on a 6.4 kb ecori fragment. coinoculation of alfalfa plants with nod- and inf- eps- mutants resulted in effective symbiosis. the nodules appeared wild type and fixed nitrogen. in constrast, coinoculations with nod- mutants and the inf- eps* mutant 101.45 did not result in the formation of effective nodules.
modeling pulmonary fibrosis by abnormal expression of telomerase/apoptosis/collagen v in experimental usual interstitial pneumonia this study was undertaken to test whether the structural remodelling of pulmonary parenchyma can be sequentially altered in a model and method that demonstrate the progression of the disease and result in remodelling within the lungs that is typical of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. three groups of mice were studied: (i) animals that received 3‐5‐di‐tert‐butyl‐4‐hydroxytoluene (bht) and were killed after 2 weeks (early bht = 9); (ii) animals that received bht and were killed after 4 weeks (late bht = 11); (iii) animals that received corn oil solution (control = 10). the mice were placed in a ventilated plexiglas chamber with a mixture of pure humidified oxygen and compressed air. lung histological sections underwent haematoxylin–eosin, immunohistochemistry (epithelial, endothelial and immune cells) and specific staining (collagen/elastic fibres) methods for morphometric analysis. when compared with the control group, early bht and late bht groups showed significant decrease of type ii pneumocytes, lower vascular density in both and higher endothelial activity. cd4 was increased in late bht compared with early and control groups, while cd8, macrophage and neutrophil cells were more prominent only in early bht. the collagenous fibre density were significantly higher only in late bht, whereas elastic fibre content in late bht was lower than that in control group. we conclude that the bht experimental model is pathologically very similar to human usual interstitial pneumonia. this feature is important in the identification of animal models of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis that can accurately reflect the pathogenesis and progression of the human disease.
managing more than the mean: using quantile regression to identify factors related to large elk groups many studies have examined grouping as a form of antipredator behaviour, but relatively few studies have examined how group size responds to natural variation in predation risk across space and through time. we studied the responses of elk, cervus elaphus, herd size and composition to natural variation in the risk of predation by wolves, canis lupus, in the gallatin canyon of montana. we found that elk herd size increased as distance to protective cover increased. a positive association between group size and distance to cover is often interpreted as evidence that grouping is an antipredator response. however, we found that herd size increased only on days that wolves were absent. when wolves were present, herd sizes remained small at all distances from cover. this suggests that aggregation far from cover on days that wolves were absent was a foraging response, rather than an antipredator response. these data highlight interaction between temporal and spatial variation in predation risk, and suggest caution in conclusions about the antipredator benefits of grouping in the absence of direct data on risk or predator presence.
number of aberrant crypt foci associated with adiposity and igf1 bioavailability there is increasing evidence that dysregulation of energy homeostasis is associated with colorectal carcinogenesis. epidemiological data have consistently demonstrated a positive relation between increased body size and colorectal malignancy, whereas mechanistic studies have sought to uncover obesity-related carcinogenic pathways. the phenomenon of "insulin resistance" or the impaired ability to normalize plasma glucose levels has formed the core of these pathways, but other mechanisms have also been advanced. obesity-induced insulin resistance leads to elevated levels of plasma insulin, glucose and fatty acids. exposure of the colonocyte to heightened concentrations of insulin may induce a mitogenic effect within these cells, whereas exposure to glucose and fatty acids may induce metabolic perturbations, alterations in cell signaling pathways and oxidative stress. the importance of chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of obesity has recently been highlighted and may represent an additional mechanism linking increased adiposity to colorectal carcinogenesis. this review provides an overview of the epidemiology of body size and colorectal neoplasia and outlines current knowledge of putative mechanisms advanced to explain this relation. family based studies have shown that the propensity to become obese is heritable, but this is only manifest in conditions of excess energy intake over expenditure. inheritance of a genetic profile that predisposes to increased body size may also be predictive of colorectal cancer. genomewide scans, linkage studies and candidate gene investigations have highlighted more than 400 chromosomal regions that may harbor variants that predispose to increased body size. the genetics underlying the pathogenesis of obesity are likely to be complex, but variants in a range of different genes have already been associated with increased body size and insulin resistance. these include genes encoding elements of insulin signaling, adipocyte metabolism and differentiation, and regulation of energy expenditure. a number of investigators have begun to study genetic variants within these pathways in relation to colorectal neoplasia, but at present data remain limited to a handful of studies. these pathways will be discussed with particular reference to genetic polymorphisms that have been associated with obesity and insulin resistance.
biochemical modulation of growth, lipid quality and productivity in mixotrophic cultures of chlorella sorokiniana microalgal oils have attracted much interest as potential feedstocks for renewable fuels, yet our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms controlling oil biosynthesis and storage in microalgae is rather limited. using chlamydomonas reinhardtii as a model system, we show here that starch, rather than oil, is the dominant storage sink for reduced carbon under a wide variety of conditions. in short-term treatments, significant amounts of oil were found to be accumulated concomitantly with starch only under conditions of n starvation, as expected, or in cells cultured with high acetate in otherwise standard growth medium. time-course analysis revealed that oil accumulation under n starvation lags behind that of starch and rapid oil synthesis occurs only when carbon supply exceeds the capacity of starch synthesis. in the starchless mutant bafj5, blocking starch synthesis results in significant increases in the extent and rate of oil accumulation. in the parental strain, but not the starchless mutant, oil accumulation under n starvation was strictly dependent on the available external acetate supply and the amount of oil increased steadily as the acetate concentration increased to the levels several-fold higher than that of the standard growth medium. additionally, oil accumulation under n starvation is saturated at low light intensities and appears to be largely independent of de novo protein synthesis. collectively, our results suggest that carbon availability is a key metabolic factor controlling oil biosynthesis and carbon partitioning between starch and oil in chlamydomonas.
pre-diabetes and arterial stiffness in uraemic patients. new-onset diabetes after renal transplantation (nodat) is known to be a potent risk factor for cardiovascular events. we therefore investigated the incidence and risk factors for nodat, and evaluated surrogate endpoints of atherosclerosis in japanese patients with stable renal function after renal transplantation. seventy-nine patients were enrolled in the study, and a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (ogtt) was performed in subjects excluding patients with known nodat. we evaluated the risk factors for nodat and the degree of atherosclerosis, determined by brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (bapwv), ankle-brachial blood pressure index (abpi) and intima-media thickness (imt) of the carotid artery. eleven patients diagnosed as nodat had significantly higher fasting plasma glucose before transplantation, blood pressure, and incidence of hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection than patients without nodat. multivariate regression analysis revealed that the independent determinant of nodat was fasting plasma glucose pre-transplantation, hcv infection and systolic blood pressure. the bapwv in patients with nodat was significantly higher compared to that in patients without nodat. in addition, the independent determinant of bapwv evaluated by multivariate regression analysis was an increase in systolic blood pressure and age, and a decrease of adiponectin levels. in conclusion, we found that high fasting plasma glucose prior to transplantation, hcv infection and high blood pressure are risk factors for nodat in japanese patients after renal transplantation. since nodat patients have advanced arterial stiffness probably due to high blood pressure, strict control of blood pressure will be important for preventing the development of cardiovascular disease in nodat.
identifying and targeting mortality disparities: a framework for sub-saharan africa using adult mortality data from south africa backgroundattributable fractions (af) assess the proportion of cases in a population attributable to certain risk factors but are infrequently reported and mostly calculated without considering potential confounders. while logistic regression for adjusted individual estimates of odds ratios (or) is widely used, similar approaches for afs are rarely applied.methodsdifferent methods for calculating adjusted afs to risk factors of cardiovascular disease (cvd) were applied using data from the national health and nutrition examination survey (nhanes). we compared afs from the unadjusted approach using levin's formula, from levin's formula using adjusted or estimates, from logistic regression according to bruzzi's approach, from logistic regression with sequential removal of risk factors ('sequential af') and from logistic regression with all possible removal sequences and subsequent averaging ('average af').resultsafs following the unadjusted and adjusted (using adjusted ors) levin's approach yielded clearly higher estimates with a total sum of more than 100% compared to adjusted approaches with sums < 100%. since afs from logistic regression were related to the removal sequence of risk factors, all possible sequences were considered and estimates were averaged. these average afs yielded plausible estimates of the population impact of considered risk factors on cvd with a total sum of 90%. the average afs for total and hdl cholesterol levels were 17%, for hypertension 16%, for smoking 11%, and for diabetes 5%.conclusionaverage afs provide plausible estimates of population attributable risks and should therefore be reported at least to supplement unadjusted estimates. we provide functions/macros for commonly used statistical programs to encourage other researchers to calculate and report average afs.
improving service evaluation in clinical genetics: identifying effects of genetic diseases on individuals and families genetic testing for inherited deafness is now available within some genetics centres. this study used a structured questionnaire to assess the potential uptake of prenatal diagnosis (pnd) for inherited deafness, and document the opinions of deaf and hearing individuals toward pnd and termination of pregnancy (top) for hearing status. participants were self-selected from the whole of the uk, of whom 644 were deaf, 143 were hard of hearing or deafened, and 527 were hearing individuals who had either a deaf parent or child. the results showed that 21% of deaf, 39% of hard of hearing and deafened, and 49% of hearing participants said they would consider pnd for deafness. six percent of deaf, 11% of hard of hearing and deafened, and 16% of hearing participants said they would consider a top if the fetus was found to be deaf. two percent of deaf participants said they would prefer to have deaf children and would consider a top if the fetus was found to be hearing.
influence of oral appliances for mandibular advancement on dentitions using a strain gauge analysis: a pilot study mandibular advancement appliances (maa) have been established as an alternative treatment option for obstructive sleep apnea (osa). although the therapeutic effect of these devices has been proven both clinically and polysomnographically through various studies, there are very few follow-up examinations in existence concerning possible dental side effects caused by the maa. however, if lifelong treatment of osa is considered, these follow-up examinations are of utmost importance. this article presents 2 cases with unexpected dental side effects and occlusal alterations caused by maa therapy.
predictors of postprandial hypotension in elderly patients with de novo parkinson’s disease postprandial hypotension was first recognized as a clinical problem in 1977 in a patient with parkinson disease [1]. however, the hypotensive effect of meal ingestion has been appreciated for a longer time. in 1935, gladstone [2] described a hypertensive patient who had had a postprandial decrease in blood pressure from 185/120 mm hg to 145/80 mm hg. in 1953, smirk [3] observed a decrease in blood pressure after patients with autonomic failure ingested food. robertson and colleagues [4] confirmed these results in patients with chronic autonomic failure and found an average decrease in systolic blood pressure of 49 6 mm hg after a meal [4]. since lipsitz and colleagues [5] first described it in nursing home residents a decade ago, postprandial hypotension has become recognized as a common disorder of blood pressure regulation in the elderly [5]. our current understanding of postprandial hypotension is limited by the lack of a standardized, clinically meaningful definition. analogous to orthostatic hypotension, postprandial hypotension is commonly defined in the literature as a decrease in systolic blood pressure of 20 mm hg or more within 2 hours of the start of a meal. postprandial hypotension also develops when the absolute level of systolic blood pressure after a meal decreases to less than 90 mm hg and when the systolic blood pressure before a meal is greater than 100 mm hg. in addition, if a meal-related decrease in systolic blood pressure exceeds the threshold for cerebral autoregulation, patients may become symptomatic when the absolute systolic blood pressure level exceeds 90 mm hg or when the postprandial systolic blood pressure decreases to less than 20 mm hg. the frequent absence of symptoms associated with this decrease in blood pressure after meal ingestion makes the value of this definition uncertain. in addition, the morbidity and mortality related to postprandial hypotension are unknown. a potential cumulative effect of multiple hypotensive stresses, such as posture change or administration of medication at the time of meal ingestion, makes assessment of the clinical relevance of individual blood pressure responses to a meal even more difficult. although it can be exacerbated by posture change, postprandial hypotension is a distinct entity that differs from orthostatic hypotension. we have reviewed the current knowledge of the epidemiology, clinical symptoms and significance, pathophysiology, and management of postprandial hypotension. we hope to make the practicing physician more aware of this common abnormality in blood pressure regulation and to stimulate new research of its mechanisms and management. methods through a medline search, we identified all articles on postprandial hypertension published between 1966 and 1994. we also used the bibliographies of relevant articles. all articles and case reports describing meal-related hypotension in the elderly and in patients with autonomic failure were included for analysis. epidemiology and associated conditions during the past decade, hypotension in response to ingestion of a mixed meal or oral glucose has been shown in healthy elderly persons [6-14]; young and elderly persons with hypertension [10, 15-21]; elderly patients in nursing homes [5, 22-25]; and patients with postprandial syncope [26, 27], autonomic insufficiency [4, 28-36], parkinson disease [1, 37-39], paraplegia [40], diabetes mellitus [28, 38, 41], cardiovascular disease [42, 43], and renal failure treated with hemodialysis [44, 45]. however, the epidemiology of postprandial hypotension has not been thoroughly studied. mild, meal-induced decreases in blood pressure are common in healthy older persons [6-11], but the prevalence of these decreases is unknown. the presence of multiple illnesses in elderly persons may further impair cardiovascular adaptation to meal ingestion and result in marked postprandial decreases in blood pressure. investigations of elderly persons living in nursing homes have shown that nearly all persons experience some decrease in blood pressure [24, 25]. in 24% to 36% of these patients, systolic blood pressure decreases more than 20 mm hg within 75 minutes of eating a meal [24, 25]. it has been difficult to dissociate the effects of physiologic aging on postprandial blood pressure regulation from those of age-associated illnesses. the elevation in blood pressure associated with aging can profoundly influence postprandial blood pressure. in a study of 82 healthy persons aged 19 to 79 years, meal-related reductions in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly correlated. however, when the data were corrected for baseline blood pressure, this correlation was no longer seen [46]. older hypertensive persons have greater reductions in blood pressure after ingesting food or oral glucose than do age-matched normotensive persons [7, 9, 10, 17-20]. postprandial decreases in systolic blood pressure ranging from 17 to 25 mm hg have been found in hypertensive elderly patients older than age 65 years who did not have other overt cardiovascular diseases [9, 10, 17, 18]. in these patients, diastolic blood pressure may decrease as much as 15 mm hg. however, because hypertensive middle-aged and young persons also have postprandial decreases in blood pressure [10, 16], this phenomenon may be primarily caused by blood pressure elevation rather than by aging itself. profound postprandial hypotension has been observed in patients with autonomic failure [1, 4, 28-36, 47, 48]. the first case report described a 65-year-old man who had dizziness and visual disturbance associated with large decreases in blood pressure after almost every meal [1]. robertson and colleagues [4] found a marked postprandial decrease in sitting systolic blood pressure (range, 22 to 98 mm hg) in 10 patients with autonomic failure. hoeldtke and associates [28, 47] studied patients with multiple-system atrophy (the shy-drager syndrome) and pure autonomic failure and found that the decrease in the mean sitting postprandial arterial blood pressure ranged from 62 to 83 mm hg [28, 47]. all of these patients had blurred vision and dizziness after the meal [47]. postprandial hypotension is also commonly found in patients with peripheral neuropathy caused by diabetes mellitus or other disorders [28, 33, 38, 41] as well as by parkinson disease [1, 37-39]. hypotension is a common side effect of antiparkinsonian drugs such as levodopa. in patients with renal failure, symptomatic postprandial hypotension has been seen during hemodialysis [44, 45]. this appears to be relevant primarily in uremic patients who have autonomic dysfunction. determining the prevalence and clinical implications of postprandial hypotension is complicated not only by different diseases and drugs in the populations studied but also by methodologic inconsistencies among studies. first, the body's position while the meal is being consumed probably affects food-induced changes in blood pressure. postprandial hypotension occurs both in the sitting and supine positions. although the sitting position is more physiologic, orthostatic changes in blood pressure during prolonged sitting might contribute to the postprandial decrease in blood pressure. second, no studies have addressed the variability of postprandial blood pressure. previous studies have shown that orthostatic blood pressure measurements in the elderly vary considerably from day to day [49]. this could also be true for postprandial hypotension. third, the nutrient composition of meals affects the magnitude of the decrease in postprandial blood pressure [12, 13, 15, 50]. carbohydrates and, more specifically, glucose have been found to play a significant role [10, 29]. however, conflicting data have been reported about the influence of fat or protein on postprandial blood pressure [12, 13, 15, 51, 52]. fourth, postprandial hypotension depends on the temperature of the meal [53]. after cold glucose solutions are ingested, blood pressure remains unchanged, whereas glucose solutions served warm or at room temperature cause a decrease in blood pressure. finally, the time at which blood pressure is measured after a meal may influence the detection of this phenomenon. postprandial hypotension can be found at all meal times [14] and is almost immediately apparent after a meal. blood pressure usually reaches a nadir within 30 to 60 minutes. in nursing home residents, the systolic blood pressure nadir occurred as early as 15 minutes after the meal in 13% to 17% of the patients and as late as 75 minutes after the meal in 11% to 13% of the patients [24, 25]. clinical symptoms and significance in elderly persons or patients with autonomic failure, postprandial reductions in blood pressure may result in syncope, falls, angina pectoris, weakness, dizziness, nausea, lightheadedness, or black spots in the visual field [1, 5, 22, 24-26, 29, 39, 46] (table 1). in addition, case reports have described elderly patients with large postprandial reductions in blood pressure who developed angina pectoris or transient ischemic attacks that resolved as blood pressure returned to normal [24, 54]. however, data on the frequency of postprandial hypotension and its potential symptoms are scarce. in one recent study, half of a group of patients with unexplained syncope had postprandial hypotension [27]. table 1. clinical symptoms associated with postprandial hypotension the cerebral symptoms probably depend on the extent to which cerebral perfusion is compromised. accumulation of age- and disease-related conditions that threaten cerebral blood flow or reduce oxygen content in the blood may bring cerebral oxygen delivery near the threshold needed to maintain consciousness [55]. therefore, even small changes in blood pressure may reduce cerebral oxygen delivery to below the critical threshold and thus result in ischemic symptoms. the potential for postprandial cerebral ischemia may be greater in elderly p
modulation of synaptic transmission by the bcl-2 family protein bcl-xl the diffusion of metabolites across the outer mitochondrial membrane is essential for coupled cellular respiration. the outer membrane of mitochondria isolated from growth factor-deprived cells is impaired in its ability to exchange metabolic anions. when added to mitochondria, recombinant bcl-xl restores metabolite exchange across the outer membrane without inducing the loss of cytochrome c from the intermembrane space. restoration of outer membrane permeability to anionic metabolites does not occur directly through bcl-xlion channels. instead, recombinant bcl-xl maintains the outer mitochondrial membrane channel, vdac, in an open configuration. consistent with these findings, when adp-induced oxidative phosphorylation is limited by exogenous β-nadh, recombinant bcl-xl can sustain outer mitochondrial membrane permeability to adp. β-nadh limits respiration by promoting the closed configuration of vdac. together these results demonstrate that following an apoptotic signal, bcl-xl can maintain metabolite exchange across the outer mitochondrial membrane by inhibiting vdac closure.
precise and efficient nucleotide substitution near genomic nick via noncanonical homology-directed repair. targeted genome editing technologies have enabled a broad range of research and medical applications. the cas9 nuclease from the microbial crispr-cas system is targeted to specific genomic loci by a 20 nt guide sequence, which can tolerate certain mismatches to the dna target and thereby promote undesired off-target mutagenesis. here, we describe an approach that combines a cas9 nickase mutant with paired guide rnas to introduce targeted double-strand breaks. because individual nicks in the genome are repaired with high fidelity, simultaneous nicking via appropriately offset guide rnas is required for double-stranded breaks and extends the number of specifically recognized bases for target cleavage. we demonstrate that using paired nicking can reduce off-target activity by 50- to 1,500-fold in cell lines and to facilitate gene knockout in mouse zygotes without sacrificing on-target cleavage efficiency. this versatile strategy enables a wide variety of genome editing applications that require high specificity.
a novel self-calibration method for a stereo-tof system using a kinect v2 and two 4k gopro cameras a metrological characterization process for time-of-flight (tof) cameras is proposed in this paper and applied to the microsoft kinect v2. based on the guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement (gum), the uncertainty of a three-dimensional (3d) scene reconstruction is analysed. in particular, the random and the systematic components of the uncertainty are evaluated for the single sensor pixel and for the complete depth camera. the manufacturer declares an uncertainty in the measurement of the central pixel of the sensor of about few millimetres (kinect for windows features, 2015), which is considerably better than the first version of the microsoft kinect (chow et?al., 2012? 1). this work points out that performances are highly influenced by measuring conditions and environmental parameters of the scene; actually the 3d point reconstruction uncertainty can vary from 1.5 to tens of millimetres. the temperature of the kinect v2 has an influence in the distance measurement.the casual uncertainty increases with the depth and the radial coordinate.the systematic uncertainty follows a harmonic trend called "wiggling error".different materials and surfaces generate small offset in the depth measurement.multiple reflections generate distortions in concave 3d geometry reconstruction.
air pollution exposure during critical time periods in gestation and alterations in cord blood lymphocyte distribution: a cohort of livebirths problem: to determine the effect of labor on lymphocyte subsets in full‐term neonates. method of study. cord blood obtained at delivery from full‐term neonates, six born vaginally and six born by elective cesarean section, was analyzed for lymphocyte subsets. monoclonal antibodies, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry were utilized to determine the lymphocyte phenotype frequencies in these neonates. these frequencies were compared by mode of delivery and to adult peripheral blood reference ranges using a two‐tailed student's t‐test,p<0.05.
development of scn connectivity and the circadian control of arousal: a diminishing role for humoral factors? study objectives daily amounts of sleep and wakefulness are accumulated in discrete bouts that exhibit distinct statistical properties. in adult mammals, sleep bout durations follow an exponential distribution whereas wake bout durations follow a power-law distribution. in infant norway rats, however, wake bouts initially follow an exponential distribution and only transition to a power-law distribution beginning around postnatal day 15 (p15). here we test the hypothesis that the locus coeruleus (lc), one of several wake-active nuclei in the brainstem, contributes to this developmental transition.   design at p7, rats were injected subcutaneously with saline or dsp-4, a neurotoxin that targets noradrenergic (na) lc terminals. then, at p21, sleep and wakefulness during the day and night were monitored. the effectiveness of dsp-4 treatment was verified by measuring na, dopamine (da), and serotonin (5-ht) concentration in cortical and non-cortical tissue using high performance liquid chromatography.   results in relation to controls, subjects treated with dsp-4 exhibited significant reductions only in cortical and non-cortical na concentration. consistent with our hypothesis, the wake bout durations of dsp-4 subjects more closely followed an exponential distribution, whereas those of control subjects followed the expected power-law distribution. sleep bout distributions were unaffected by dsp-4.   conclusions these results suggest that the fundamental developmental transition in the statistical structure of wake bout durations is effected in part by changes in noradrenergic lc functioning. considered within the domain of network theory, the hub-like connectivity of the lc may have important implications for the maintenance of network function in the face of random or targeted neural degeneration.
effects of early-fruit removal on endogenous cytokinins and abscisic acid in relation to leaf senescence in cotton leaf senescence varies greatly among cotton cultivars, possibly due to their root characteristics, particularly the root-sourced cytokinins and abscisic acid (aba). early-senescence (k1) and late-senescence (k2) lines, were reciprocally or self-grafted to examine the effects of rootstock on leaf senescence and endogenous hormones in both leaves and xylem sap. the results indicate that the graft of k1 scion onto k2 rootstock (k1/k2) alleviated leaf senescence with enhanced photosynthetic (pn) rate, increased levels of chlorophyll (chl) and total soluble protein (tsp), concurrently with reduced malondialdehyde (mda) contents in the fourth leaf on the main-stem. the graft of k2 scion onto k1 rootstock enhanced leaf senescence with reduced pn, chl, and tsp, and increased mda, compared with their respective self-grafted control plants (k1/k1 and k2/k2). reciprocally grafted plants differed significantly from their self-grafted control plants in levels of zeatin and its riboside (z+zr), isopentenyl and its adenine (ip+ipa), and aba, but not in those of dihydrozeatin and its riboside (dhz+dhzr) in leaves in late season, which was consistent with variations in leaf senescence between reciprocally and self-grafted plants. the results suggest that leaf senescence is closely associated with reduced accumulation of z+zr, and ip+ipa rather than dhz+dhzr, or enhanced aba in leaves of cotton. genotypic variation in leaf senescence may result from the difference in root characteristics, particularly in z+zr, ip+ipa, and aba which are regulated by the root system directly or indirectly.
a cytokinin-activating enzyme promotes tuber formation in tomato cytokinins (cks) are a group of phytohormones that play a crucial role in the regulation of plant growth and development. identification of the enzymes and the corresponding genes that are involved in ck metabolism allowed us to understand how plants synthesize cks and adjust ck activity to optimal levels. a major accomplishment toward these goals was the identification of genes for the first enzyme in the ck biosynthetic pathway, adenosine phosphate-isopentenyltransferase (ipt). in arabidopsis thaliana and agrobacterium tumefaciens, detailed analyses of ipts were conducted through not only enzymatic characterization but also molecular structural approaches. these studies revealed the molecular basis for the agrobacterium-origin of ipt used for the efficient biosynthesis of trans-zeatin that promotes tumorigenesis in host plants. another landmark in ck research was the identification of cyp735a as an enzyme that converts ip-nucleotide to tz-nucleotide. furthermore, the identification of a ck-activating enzyme, log, which catalyzes a novel activation pathway, is a remarkable recent achievement in ck research. collectively, these advances have revealed the complexity of the entire metabolic scheme for ck biosynthesis.
early traumatized inpatients high in psychoform and somatoform dissociation: characteristics and treatment response dissociation is a lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feelings, and experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory. dissociation occurs to some degree in normal individuals and is thought to be more prevalent in persons with major mental illnesses. the dissociative experiences scale (des) has been developed to offer a means of reliably measuring dissociation in normal and clinical populations. scale items were developed using clinical data and interviews, scales involving memory loss, and consultations with experts in dissociation. pilot testing was performed to refine the wording and format of the scale. the scale is a 28-item self-report questionnaire. subjects were asked to make slashes on 100-mm lines to indicate where they fall on a continuum for each question. in addition, demographic information (age, sex, occupation, and level of education) was collected so that the connection between these variables and scale scores could be examined. the mean of all item scores ranges from 0 to 100 and is called the des score. the scale was administered to between 10 and 39 subjects in each of the following populations: normal adults, late adolescent college students, and persons suffering from alcoholism, agoraphobia, phobicanxious disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, and multiple personality disorder. reliability testing of the scale showed that the scale had good test-retest and good split-half reliability. item-scale score correlations were all significant, indicating good internal consistency and construct validity. a kruskal-wallis test and post hoc comparisons of the scores of the eight populations provided evidence of the scale's criterion-referenced validity. the scale was able to distinguish between subjects with a dissociative disorder (multiple personality) and all other subjects.
rutin as a potent antioxidant: implications for neurodegenerative disorders berries are a good source of natural antioxidants. in the present study, the total antioxidant capacity and phenolic composition of three berry fruits (blueberry, blackberry, and strawberry) cultivated in nanjing were investigated. blueberry, with a trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (teac) value of 14.98 mmol trolox/100 g dry weight (dw), exhibited the strongest total antioxidant capacity using both the 2,2-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (abts) and the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (dpph) methods. blueberry also had the highest total phenolic content (tpc, 9.44 mg gallic acid/g dw), total flavonoid content (tfc, 36.08 mg rutin/g dw), and total anthocyanidin content (tac, 24.38 mg catechin/g dw). a preliminary analysis using high performance liquid chromatography (hplc) showed that the blueberry, blackberry, and strawberry samples tested contained a range of phenolic acids (including gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, ellagic acid, and cinnamic acid) and various types of flavonoids (flavone: luteolin; flavonols: rutin, myricetin, quercetrin, and quercetin; flavanols: gallocatechin, epigallocatechin, catechin, and catechin gallate; anthocyanidins: malvidin-3-galactoside, malvidin-3-glucoside, and cyanidin). in particular, the blueberries had high levels of proanthocyanidins and anthocyanidins, which might be responsible for their strong antioxidant activities. these results indicate a potential market role for berries (especially blueberries) as a functional food ingredient or nutraceutical.
enhancement of butanol tolerance and butanol yield in clostridium acetobutylicum mutant nt642 obtained by nitrogen ion beam implantation lactic acid-producing bacteria are associated with various plant and animal niches and play a key role in the production of fermented foods and beverages. we report nine genome sequences representing the phylogenetic and functional diversity of these bacteria. the small genomes of lactic acid bacteria encode a broad repertoire of transporters for efficient carbon and nitrogen acquisition from the nutritionally rich environments they inhabit and reflect a limited range of biosynthetic capabilities that indicate both prototrophic and auxotrophic strains. phylogenetic analyses, comparison of gene content across the group, and reconstruction of ancestral gene sets indicate a combination of extensive gene loss and key gene acquisitions via horizontal gene transfer during the coevolution of lactic acid bacteria with their habitats.
intradural prostate carcinoma metastatic lesion mimicking an exophytic ependymoma: case report the management of 10 patients with symptomatic localized intradural extramedullary spinal metastasis is reviewed. the single most common primary source was carcinoma of the breast (four cases). the initial symptom in nine patients was pain, with five patients reporting a characteristically severe cramping discomfort with radicular distribution. all patients underwent laminectomy decompression. at the time of surgery, six of the patients were weak but ambulatory and four were bedridden. following surgery, four patients enjoyed some measure of pain relief, seven patients became ambulatory, and three remained bedridden. two patients achieved a "satisfactory" result, and were walking and continent 6 months after surgery. secondary brain tumors were demonstrated or implicated in nine patients, supporting the concept that the spinal metastases represented tertiary deposits following dissemination via the cerebrospinal fluid. symptomatic intradural extramedullary spinal metastasis causes a virulent clinical syndrome with poor prognosis and disappointing outcome after treatment. given the high incidence of associated cerebral metastatic involvement, total neuraxis radiation and/or chemotherapy should be considered when symptomatic spinal metastasis is discovered to be intradural and extramedullary.
phishing detection based associative classification data mining building fast and accurate classifiers for large-scale databases is an important task in data mining. there is growing evidence that integrating classification and association rule mining together can produce more efficient and accurate classifiers than traditional classification techniques. in this paper, the problem of producing rules with multiple labels is investigated. we propose a new associative classification approach called multi-class, multi-label associative classification (mmac). this paper also presents three measures for evaluating the accuracy of data mining classification approaches to a wide range of traditional and multi-label classification problems. results for 28 different datasets show that the mmac approach is an accurate and effective classification technique, highly competitive and scalable in comparison with other classification approaches.
number of aberrant crypt foci associated with adiposity and igf1 bioavailability there is increasing evidence that dysregulation of energy homeostasis is associated with colorectal carcinogenesis. epidemiological data have consistently demonstrated a positive relation between increased body size and colorectal malignancy, whereas mechanistic studies have sought to uncover obesity-related carcinogenic pathways. the phenomenon of "insulin resistance" or the impaired ability to normalize plasma glucose levels has formed the core of these pathways, but other mechanisms have also been advanced. obesity-induced insulin resistance leads to elevated levels of plasma insulin, glucose and fatty acids. exposure of the colonocyte to heightened concentrations of insulin may induce a mitogenic effect within these cells, whereas exposure to glucose and fatty acids may induce metabolic perturbations, alterations in cell signaling pathways and oxidative stress. the importance of chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of obesity has recently been highlighted and may represent an additional mechanism linking increased adiposity to colorectal carcinogenesis. this review provides an overview of the epidemiology of body size and colorectal neoplasia and outlines current knowledge of putative mechanisms advanced to explain this relation. family based studies have shown that the propensity to become obese is heritable, but this is only manifest in conditions of excess energy intake over expenditure. inheritance of a genetic profile that predisposes to increased body size may also be predictive of colorectal cancer. genomewide scans, linkage studies and candidate gene investigations have highlighted more than 400 chromosomal regions that may harbor variants that predispose to increased body size. the genetics underlying the pathogenesis of obesity are likely to be complex, but variants in a range of different genes have already been associated with increased body size and insulin resistance. these include genes encoding elements of insulin signaling, adipocyte metabolism and differentiation, and regulation of energy expenditure. a number of investigators have begun to study genetic variants within these pathways in relation to colorectal neoplasia, but at present data remain limited to a handful of studies. these pathways will be discussed with particular reference to genetic polymorphisms that have been associated with obesity and insulin resistance.
melatonin modulates neuronal cell death induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress under insulin resistance condition most protein phosphatases have little intrinsic substrate specificity, making selective pharmacological inhibition of specific dephosphorylation reactions a challenging problem. in a screen for small molecules that protect cells from endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress, we identified salubrinal, a selective inhibitor of cellular complexes that dephosphorylate eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit alpha (eif2alpha). salubrinal also blocks eif2alpha dephosphorylation mediated by a herpes simplex virus protein and inhibits viral replication. these results suggest that selective chemical inhibitors of eif2alpha dephosphorylation may be useful in diseases involving er stress or viral infection. more broadly, salubrinal demonstrates the feasibility of selective pharmacological targeting of cellular dephosphorylation events.
economic estimation of the losses caused by surface water pollution accidents in china from the perspective of water bodies’ functions eutrophication has many known consequences, but there are few data on the environmental and health costs. we developed a new framework of cost categories that assess both social and ecological damage costs and policy response costs. these findings indicate the severe effects of nutrient enrichment and eutrophication on many sectors of the economy. we estimate the damage costs of freshwater eutrophication in england and wales to be $105-160 million yr(-1) (pound 75.0-114.3 m). the policy response costs are a measure of how much is being spent to address this damage, and these amount to $77 million yr(-1) pound 54.8 m). the damage costs are dominated by seven items each with costs of $15 million yr(-1) or more: reduced value of waterfront dwellings, drinking water treatment costs for nitrogen removal, reduced recreational and amenity value of water bodies, drinking water treatment costs for removal of algal toxins and decomposition products, reduced value of nonpolluted atmosphere, negative ecological effects on biota, and net economic losses from the tourist industry. in common with other environmental problems, it would represent net value (or cost reduction) if damage was prevented at source. a variety of effective economic, regulatory, and administrative policy instruments are available for internalizing these costs.
the combination of mln2238 (ixazomib) with interferon-alpha results in enhanced cell death in melanoma purpose: the success of bortezomib therapy for treatment of multiple myeloma (mm) led to the development of structurally and pharmacologically distinct novel proteasome inhibitors. in the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of one such novel orally bioactive proteasome inhibitor mln9708/mln2238 in mm using well-established in vitro and in vivo models. experimental design: mm cell lines, primary patient cells, and the human mm xenograft animal model were used to study the antitumor activity of mn2238. results: treatment of mm cells with mln2238 predominantly inhibits chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome and induces accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. mln2238 inhibits growth and induces apoptosis in mm cells resistant to conventional and bortezomib therapies without affecting the viability of normal cells. in animal tumor model studies, mln2238 is well tolerated and inhibits tumor growth with significantly reduced tumor recurrence. a head-to-head analysis of mln2238 versus bortezomib showed a significantly longer survival time in mice treated with mln2238 than mice receiving bortezomib. immununostaining of mm tumors from mln2238-treated mice showed growth inhibition, apoptosis, and a decrease in associated angiogenesis. mechanistic studies showed that mln2238-triggered apoptosis is associated with activation of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9; increase in p53, p21, noxa, puma, and e2f; induction of endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress response proteins bip, phospho-eif2-α, and chop; and inhibition of nuclear factor kappa b. finally, combining mln2238 with lenalidomide, histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, or dexamethasone triggers synergistic anti-mm activity. conclusion: our preclinical study supports clinical evaluation of mln9708, alone or in combination, as a potential mm therapy. clin cancer res; 17(16); 5311–21. ©2011 aacr.
analysis of interactions of salmonella type three secretion mutants with 3-d intestinal epithelial cells abstract salmonella enterica is an important diarrheal pathogen, and infections may involve severe systemic sequelae depending on serovar- and host-specific factors. the molecular mechanisms underlying translocation of host-restricted and -specific serovars of s. enterica from the intestines to distal organs are ill defined. by surgical cannulation of lymph and blood vessels draining the distal ileum in cattle, s. enterica serovar dublin was observed to translocate predominantly via mesenteric lymph nodes to efferent lymphatics in a manner that correlates with systemic virulence, since the fowl typhoid-associated serovar gallinarum translocated at a significantly lower level. while both s. enterica serovars dublin and gallinarum were intracellular while in the intestinal mucosa and associated with major histocompatibility complex class ii-positive cells, the bacteria were predominantly extracellular within efferent lymph. screening of a library of signature-tagged serovar dublin mutants following oral inoculation of calves defined the role of 36 virulence-associated loci in enteric and systemic phases of infection. the number and proportion of tagged clones reaching the liver and spleen early after oral infection were identical to the values in efferent lymph, implying that this may be a relevant mode of dissemination. coinfection studies confirmed that lymphatic translocation requires the function of type iii secretion system 1 (t3ss-1) but, remarkably, not t3ss-2. this is the first description of the mode and genetics of systemic translocation of serovar dublin in its natural host.
field evidence for indirect interactions between foliar‐feeding insect and root‐feeding nematode communities on nicotiana tabacum the majority of studies exploring interactions between above- and below-ground biota have been focused on the effects of root-associated organisms on foliar herbivorous insects. this study examined the effects of foliar herbivory by pieris brassicae l. (lepidoptera: pieridae) on the performance of the root herbivore delia radicum l. (diptera: anthomyiidae) and its parasitoid trybliographa rapae (westwood) (hymenoptera: figitidae), mediated through a shared host plant brassica nigra l. (brassicaceae). in the presence of foliar herbivory, the survival of d. radicum and t. rapae decreased significantly by more than 50%. in addition, newly emerged adults of both root herbivores and parasitoids were significantly smaller on plants that had been exposed to foliar herbivory than on control plants. to determine what factor(s) may have accounted for the observed results, we examined the effects of foliar herbivory on root quantity and quality. no significant differences in root biomass were found between plants with and without shoot herbivore damage. moreover, concentrations of nitrogen in root tissues were also unaffected by shoot damage by p. brassicae larvae. however, higher levels of indole glucosinolates were measured in roots of plants exposed to foliar herbivory, suggesting that the development of the root herbivore and its parasitoid may be, at least partly, negatively affected by increased levels of these allelochemicals in root tissues. our results show that foliar herbivores can affect the development not only of root-feeding insects but also their natural enemies. we argue that such indirect interactions between above- and below-ground biota may play an important role in the structuring and functioning of communities.
the in vivo dynamic fatigue response of the spine to sudden loading in the sagittal plane: effects of pre-load and step input magnitude. objective to evaluate the impact of muscle pre-activation levels and load magnitude on the response of the trunk to loading conditions causing rapid flexion.   design eight male subjects were asked to maintain an upright standing posture while resisting the application of forward flexion moments produced by four different loading conditions consisting of combinations of two pre-loads (4% or 16% of the maximum extensor moment) and two added loads (12% or 24%). pre-loading was used to develop different initial levels of trunk muscle activity prior to the application of the added loads. of special interest were the two conditions that resulted in total final loads of 28%.   background cocontraction of the antagonistic and agonistic muscles of the trunk are required to provide stability during normal physiological loading conditions. in several in vivo studies, levels of trunk muscle cocontraction have been observed prior to the application of unexpected or sudden loads. forces from the abdominal muscles have been proposed to provide stability when extensor moments are generated. the response of trunk muscles to rapid flexor moments would provide further insight into the dynamic stability mechanisms of the spine.   methods measurements were made of the trunk extensor moments, angular displacement of the trunk and unilateral surface emg amplitudes of three abdominal and three trunk extensor muscles. values were recorded during the isometric pre-load and for the maximum magnitude of each variable in response to the added load.   results higher pre-loads resulted in lower flexion rotations of the spine and higher added loads caused larger rotations. with increasing magnitudes of final loads, a corresponding increase in trunk extensor moments and trunk muscle cocontraction was observed. the largest activations were observed in the lumbar erector spinae and thoracic erector spinae muscles, while smaller yet substantial emg activity was observed in the internal oblique and external oblique. a comparison of the 28% loading conditions showed an increased response of the trunk to the [4 + 24] loading condition (with lower initial trunk stiffness) when compared to the [16 + 12] loading condition.   conclusions pre-activation of trunk extensor muscles can serve to reduce the flexion displacements caused by rapid loading. the abdominal oblique muscles, especially external oblique, will rapidly increase their activation levels in response to rapid loading. these changes are more pronounced when pre-activation levels are low, resulting in lower initial trunk stiffness and spine compression force. it is proposed that these factors will ultimately affect spine stability and the risk of injury.   relevance the results of this study provide insight into several mechanisms involved in the dynamic stability of the spine. injuries can be caused by unexpected and rapid loading of the spine. a study of the mechanisms available to respond to such perturbations is important to an understanding of spine mechanics and the etiology of low back injury.
global sumoylation is a molecular mechanism underlying hypothermia-induced ischemic tolerance during the last decade, sumoylation has emerged as a central regulatory post-translational modification in the control of the fate and function of proteins. however, how sumoylation is regulated itself has just started to be delineated. it appears now that sumo (small ubiquitin-related modifier) conjugation/deconjugation equilibrium is affected by various environmental stresses, including osmotic, hypoxic, heat, oxidative and genotoxic stresses. this regulation occurs either at the level of individual targets, through an interplay between stress-induced phosphorylation and sumoylation, or via modulation of the conjugation/deconjugation machinery abundance or activity. the present review gives an overview of the connections between stress and sumoylation, the underlying molecular mechanisms and their effects on cellular functions.
shifting soil resource limitations and ecosystem retrogression across a three million year semi-arid substrate age gradient wardle et al .

successful nonsurgical treatment of pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, pneumoperitoneum, pneumoretroperitoneum, and subcutaneous emphysema following ercp endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp)-related perforation occurs in 0.1-1.8% of patients after therapeutic ercp. it is a serious complication with a high mortality. however, little evidence exists in the medical literature and the optimal management remains unclear. this review aims to critically evaluate the optimal management of therapeutic ercp-related perforation.
δ‐opioid receptors in the accumbens shell mediate the influence of both excitatory and inhibitory predictions on choice the role of temporal factors in the development of conditioned inhibition was investigated in a backward conditioning design. separate groups of rats received tone css either 3 or 30 sec following shock presentations. the css predicted the same shock-free interval for both groups. a third group was presented with a random relationship between cs and shock. the css were tested by super-imposition on a sidman avoidance baseline and only the group with a 3-sec ucs-cs interval revealed an inhibitory effect of the cs. these results are in accord with predictions made by the solomon-corbit model of acquired motivation and by denny’s “relaxation” theory of escape and avoidance.
physician's first clinical impression of emergency department patients with nonspecific complaints is associated with morbidity and mortality study objective to date, no german triage tool with proven reliability and validity exists. the goal of this project is to translate and culturally adapt the emergency severity index (esi) and to assess reliability and validity of the german version.   methods the esi was translated following principles recommended for the translation and cultural adaptation of instruments. we performed a prospective, single-center cohort study. reliability was assessed by calculating cohen's weighted κ for agreement of 2 experts who reviewed the triage nurses' notes. to assess validity, associations of the number of resources, hospitalization, admission to intensive care, length of stay, and mortality with the assigned esi level were investigated.   results only small cultural adaptations had to be made during the translation process. interrater agreement was high (κ(w) = 0.985) in a sample of 125 patients. for the assessment of validity, a sample of 2,114 patients was used. spearman's rank correlation coefficient between esi category and number of resources was ρ = -0.567. the association (kendall's τ) between esi category and disposition, and hospitalization was τ = -0.429 and τ = -0.453, respectively. the areas under the curves for the predictive ability of the esi for hospitalization in general and hospitalization to an icu were 0.788 and 0.856, respectively. the association between emergency department length of stay and esi category was also significant (kruskal-wallis χ² = 450.8; df = 4; p < .001). furthermore, the association between esi category and survival probability was significant (log-rank χ² = 36.06; df = 3; p < .001).   conclusion translation of the esi following guidelines was feasible and resulted in a reliable and valid german version.
staphylococcus epidermidis: metabolic adaptation and biofilm formation in response to different oxygen concentrations. d-lactate dehydrogenase (d-ldh) of escherichia coli is a peripheral membrane respiratory enzyme involved in electron transfer, located on the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane. d-ldh catalyzes the oxidation of d-lactate to pyruvate, which is coupled to transmembrane transport of amino acids and sugars. here we describe the crystal structure at 1.9 a resolution of the three domains of d-ldh: the flavin adenine dinucleotide (fad)-binding domain, the cap domain, and the membrane-binding domain. the fad-binding domain contains the site of d-lactate reduction by a noncovalently bound fad cofactor and has an overall fold similar to other members of a recently discovered fad-containing family of proteins. this structural similarity extends to the cap domain as well. the most prominent difference between d-ldh and the other members of the fad-containing family is the membrane-binding domain, which is either absent in some of these proteins or differs significantly. the d-ldh membrane-binding domain presents an electropositive surface with six arg and five lys residues, which presumably interacts with the negatively charged phospholipid head groups of the membrane. thus, d-ldh appears to bind the membrane through electrostatic rather than hydrophobic forces.
continuous monitoring in the dynamic sensor field model we introduce a formal model of computation for networks of tiny artifacts, the static synchronous sensor field model (sssf) which considers that the devices communicate through a fixed communication graph and interact with the environment through input/output data streams. we analyze the performance of sssfs solving two sensing problems the average monitoring and the alerting problems. for constant memory sssfs we show that the set of recognized languages is contained in dspace(n + m) where n is the number of nodes of the communication graph and m its number of edges. finally we explore the capabilities of sssfs having sensing and additional non-sensing constant memory devices.
contrasting duration of inhibition of cell-cell communication in primary mouse epidermal cells by phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate and by bryostatin 1. hormonal induction of granulosa cell maturation is inhibited by phorbol esters and permeant synthetic diacylglycerols, but these activators of protein kinase c differ in their effects on camp production and actions. both agents prevented the induction of luteinizing hormone receptors and progesterone biosynthesis by follicle-stimulating hormone, choleragen, and forskolin, but only diacylglycerol abolished the camp responses to these stimuli. granulosa cell aggregation and aromatase activity were inhibited by phorbol ester but not completely by diacylglycerol. in intact granulosa cells, cytosolic c kinase activity was rapidly decreased by phorbol ester but unaffected by diacylglycerol. although diacylglycerol has a marked inhibitory action on camp production, the more prominent suppression of granulosa cell differentiation by phorbol ester may be related to its rapid and prolonged action on kinase c.
identification and characterization of a gene activated by the deformed homeoprotein. mutations in the fushi tarazu (ftz) locus of drosophila result in embryos with half the usual number of body segments. the sequences of the wild-type gene, a temperature-sensitive allele and a dominant mutant allele are presented. a portion of the conserved protein domain present in ftz and several homoeotic genes resembles the dna-binding region of prokaryotic dna-binding proteins, and is also similar to products of the yeast mating-type locus.
‘ballroom itself can either make you or break you’ – black gbt youths’ psychosocial development in the house ball community objectives i incorporated qualitative methods to explore how hiv-related stigma functions in new york city's house and ball community (hbc).   methods from january through march 2009, i conducted 20 in-depth 1-on-1 interviews with a diverse sample of new york city hbc members. interviews addressed perceptions of hiv-related stigma, the treatment of hiv-positive members in the community, and the potential impact of hiv-related stigma on risk behaviors.   results hiv-related stigma contributes to a loss of moral experience for hbc members. moral experience (i.e., threats to what really matters in a community) disrupts established social connections and hinders the attainment of "ball status" (i.e., amassing social recognition) in the local world of these individuals.   conclusions my recommendations address hiv-related stigma in the new york city hbc from the vantage of moral experience and highlight the need for longitudinal studies of individual house members and for the implementation of stigma-focused interventions in the community that utilize the unique ball status hierarchy and hbc network to influence social norms surrounding the treatment of hiv-positive community members.
cubosomes containing the adjuvants imiquimod and monophosphoryl lipid a stimulate robust cellular and humoral immune responses. although the currently available vaccines represent an outstanding success story in modern medicine and have had a dramatic effect on morbidity and mortality worldwide, it is clear that improvements are required in the current vaccine delivery technologies. improvements are required to enable the successful development of vaccines against infectious diseases that have so far proven difficult to control with conventional approaches. improvements may include the addition of novel injectable adjuvants or the use of novel routes of delivery, including mucosal immunization. mucosal delivery may be required to provide protection against pathogens that infect at mucosal sites, including sexually transmitted diseases. alternatively, novel approaches to delivery, including mucosal administration, may be used to improve compliance for existing vaccines. of particular interest for safer mass immunization campaigns are needle-free delivery devices, which would avoid problems due to needle re-use in many parts of the world and would avoid needle-stick injuries.
face recognition using 2.5d shape information previous work has demonstrated that the image variation of many objects (human faces in particular) under variable lighting can be effectively modeled by low-dimensional linear spaces, even when there are multiple light sources and shadowing. basis images spanning this space are usually obtained in one of three ways: a large set of images of the object under different lighting conditions is acquired, and principal component analysis (pca) is used to estimate a subspace. alternatively, synthetic images are rendered from a 3d model (perhaps reconstructed from images) under point sources and, again, pca is used to estimate a subspace. finally, images rendered from a 3d model under diffuse lighting based on spherical harmonics are directly used as basis images. in this paper, we show how to arrange physical lighting so that the acquired images of each object can be directly used as the basis vectors of a low-dimensional linear space and that this subspace is close to those acquired by the other methods. more specifically, there exist configurations of k point light source directions, with k typically ranging from 5 to 9, such that, by taking k images of an object under these single sources, the resulting subspace is an effective representation for recognition under a wide range of lighting conditions. since the subspace is generated directly from real images, potentially complex and/or brittle intermediate steps such as 3d reconstruction can be completely avoided; nor is it necessary to acquire large numbers of training images or to physically construct complex diffuse (harmonic) light fields. we validate the use of subspaces constructed in this fashion within the context of face recognition.
pkcη regulates the tgfβ3-induced chondevrepogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cell protein kinase c eta (pkceta) is one of several pkc isoforms found in humans. it is a novel pkc isoform in that it is activated by diacylglycerol and anionic phospholipids but not calcium. the crystal structure of the pkceta-c2 domain, which is thought to mediate anionic phospholipid sensing in the protein, was determined at 1.75 a resolution. the structure is similar to that of the pkc epsilon c2 domain but with significant variations at the putative lipid-binding site. two serine residues within pkc eta were identified in vitro as potential autophosphorylation sites. in the unphosphorylated structure both serines line the putative lipid-binding site and may therefore play a role in the lipid-regulation of the kinase.
run charts revisited: a simulation study of run chart rules for detection of non-random variation in health care processes this article builds on my article in the january 2002 issue of jacm on the use of run charts to analyze data variation and document process improvement. it describes a more powerful tool than the run chart for analyzing variation and measuring process improvement, namely, the control chart developed by walter shewhart. this article first explains the basic elements of a control chart, the tests for detecting a special cause variation, and how to choose the best control chart for the type of data being collected. it concludes with one case study using a control chart to document a successful intervention and some suggestions regarding computer software.
robust stability criteria for takagi-sugeno fuzzy cohen-grossberg neural networks of neutral type abstract in this paper, by using topological degree theory and lyapunov–krasovskii function method, the problem of stability is investigated for a class of mixed-delayed cohen–grossberg neural networks with inverse lipschitz neuron activations and nonsmooth behaved functions. several novel delay-dependent sufficient conditions are established towards the existence, uniqueness and global exponential stability of the equilibrium point, which are shown in terms of linear matrix inequalities. besides, for the case of the activation function satisfying not only the inverse lipschitz conditions but also the lipschitz conditions, two criteria are derived by virtue of homeomorphism mapping principle, free-weighting matrix method and cauchy–schwarz inequality, which generalize some previous results. finally, two examples with their simulations are given to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.
rna polymerase elongation factors. the universal bacterial transcription elongation factor nusa mediates elongation activities of rna polymerase. by itself, nusa induces transcription pausing and facilitates intrinsic termination, but nusa also is a cofactor of antiterminators that antagonize pausing and prevent termination. we show that nusa is required for lambda-related phage 82 antiterminator q(82) to construct a stable complex in which rna-based termination mechanisms have restricted access to the emerging transcript; this result suggests a locale for both q(82) and nusa near the beta flap domain of rna polymerase. furthermore, as nusa is not required for the antipausing activity of q(82) in vitro, we distinguish two distinct activities of antiterminators, namely antipausing and rna occlusion, and discuss their roles in q(82) function.
chronic cocaine self-administration in rhesus monkeys: impact on associative learning, cognitive control, and working memory how do the frontal lobes support behavioural flexibility? one key element is the ability to adjust responses when the reinforcement value of stimuli change. in monkeys, this ability--a form of affective shifting known as reversal learning--depends on orbitofrontal cortex. the present study examines the anatomical bases of reversal learning in humans. subjects with lesions of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex were compared with a group with dorsolateral frontal lobe damage, as well as with normal controls on a simple reversal learning task. neither form of frontal damage affected initial stimulus-reinforcement learning; ventromedial frontal damage selectively impaired reversal learning.
sources of seasonal fractional integration in macroeconomic time series a simple construction that will be referred to as an error-duration model is shown to generate fractional integration and long memory. an error-duration representation also exists for many familiar arma models, making error duration an alternative to autoregression for explaining dynamic persistence in economic variables. the results lead to a straightforward procedure for simulating fractional integration and establish a connection between fractional integration and common notions of structural change. two examples show how the error-duration model could account for fractional integration in aggregate employment and in asset price volatility.
different neural systems mediate morphine reward and its spontaneous withdrawal aversion the most important clinical properties of local anaesthetic agents are potency, onset, duration of action and relative blockade of sensory and motor fibres. these qualities are related primarily to the physicochemical properties of the various compounds. in general, lipid solubility determines the relative intrinsic potency of the various agents, while protein binding influences the duration of anaesthesia and pka is correlated with the onset of action. in general, the local anaesthetics for infiltration, peripheral nerve blockade, and extradural anaesthesia can be classified into three groups: agents of low potency and short duration, for example procaine and chloroprocaine; agents of moderate potency and duration, for example lignocaine, mepivacaine and prilocaine; and agents of high potency and long duration, for example amethocaine, bupivacaine and etidocaine. these local anaesthetics also vary in terms of onset: chloroprocaine, lignocaine, mepivacaine, prilocaine and etidocaine have a rapid onset, while procaine, amethocaine and bupivacaine are characterized by a longer latency period.
phase modulation of terahertz waves in arrayed nanowire heterojunction diode we investigate the polarizability of terahertz (thz) waves emitted from undoped in0.2ga0.8as nanowires (nws). thz emission amplitude shows strong enhancement in vertically aligned nws compared to less-aligned nws. in particular, polarized thz waves are clearly demonstrated in aligned nws via a drastic variation of amplitudes as a function of the axis angle in polarization-sensitive photoconductive antenna. in addition, phase reversal between aligned and less-aligned nws substantiates the geometrical dependence of electronic diffusion in generating the transient thz electric fields.
susceptibility, phenotypes of resistance, and extended-spectrum β-lactamases in acinetobacter baumannii strains. we have determined the nucleotide sequence (embl accession number, z 21957) of the cloned chromosomal per-1 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase gene from a pseudomonas aeruginosa rnl-1 clinical isolate, blaper-1 corresponds to a 924-bp open reading frame which encodes a polypeptide of 308 amino acids. this open reading frame is preceded by a -10 and a -35 region consistent with a putative p. aeruginosa promoter. primer extension analysis of the per-1 mrna start revealed that this promoter was active in p. aeruginosa but not in escherichia coli, in which per-1 expression was driven by vector promoter sequences. n-terminal sequencing identified the per-1 26-amino-acid leader peptide and enabled us to calculate the molecular mass (30.8 kda) of the per-1 mature form. analysis of the percent gc content of blaper-1 and of its 5' upstream sequences, as well as the codon usage for blaper-1, indicated that blaper-1 may have been inserted into p. aeruginosa genomic dna from a nonpseudomonad bacterium. the per-1 gene showed very low homology with other beta-lactamase genes at the dna level. by using computer methods, assessment of the extent of identity between per-1 and 10 beta-lactamase amino acid sequences indicated that per-1 is a class a beta-lactamase. per-1 shares around 27% amino acid identity with the sequenced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases of the tem-shv series and men-1 from enterobacteriaceae species. the use of parsimony methods showed that per-1 is not more closely related to gram-negative than to gram-positive bacterial class a beta-lactamases. surprisingly, among class a beta-lactamases, per-1 was most closely related to the recently reported cfxa from bacteroides vulgatus, with which it shared 40% amino acid identity. this work indicates that non-enterobacteriaceae species such as p. aeruginosa may possess class a extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes possibly resulting from intergeneric dna transfer. images
finite element modeling of short-wavelength folding on venus: implications for the plume hypothesis for crustal plateau formation crustal plateaus on venus constitute one of that planet’s most intriguing tectonic features. they host so-called “tessera” terrain, or deformed crust exhibiting two or more sets of intersecting tectonic lineaments, which comprises»8% of venus’ surface. major questions surrounding crustal plateaus and tessera terrain include: (1) what is the nature of crustal plateau deformation? what structures are present, and what are their spatial and temporal relations? (2) what is the global distribution of tessera terrain? does it form a global layer under the regional plains, cropping out in crustal plateaus, or is it confined to crustal plateaus? and (3) what are the implications of (1) and (2) for understanding the processes responsible for formation and deformation of crustal plateaus? structural and kinematic analyses reveal that deformation at ovda regio, venus largest crustal plateau, is characterized by linear shallow steep-sided troughs (ribbons), long arcuate long-wavelength folds, short mid-wavelength folds, and wide complex graben. temporal relations between structures lead to a three-phase regional strain history consisting of (1) layer-normal flattening of a thin competent membrane resulting in radially oriented, distributed extension (ribbon formation); (2) modest contraction of a thicker layer (concentric folding at plateau margins, interference folding in the plateau interior); and (3) limited extension localized at fold crests (graben formation). wavelength analysis of ribbons and folds places limits on the thickness of the competent layer during each stage of deformation and reflects an early shallow brittle‐ductile transition (bdt) that deepened with time. ovda’s deformation, topography, and gravity are all spatially correlated, strongly suggesting a genetic relationship between surface deformation and processes causing crustal thickening and plateau uplift. thus tessera terrain at ovda regio is likely confined to the topographically high plateau and does not extend beneath the surrounding regional plains. similar patterns persist at other crustal plateaus, indicating that tessera terrain is in general confined to crustal plateaus and does not form a globally continuous layer. ovda’s structures, their spatial and temporal relations, the resulting strain history, and the behavior of the bdt through time support a model of mantle plume upwelling in a thin lithospheric regime for crustal plateau formation and contradict previous downwelling models. similarities between structural and kinematic trends at ovda regio and other crustal plateaus lend support to this idea. c ∞ 1999 academic press
applicability of a segmental bioelectrical impedance analysis for predicting the whole body skeletal muscle volume. this study aimed to investigate the validity of using segmental bioelectrical impedance (bi) analysis for estimating skeletal muscle volume (mv) in the trunk, defined as the body segment from the acromion process to the greater trochanter. using a magnetic resonance imaging (mri) method, the trunk mv was determined in 28 men (19 approximately 34 yr), divided into validation (n = 20) and cross-validation (n = 8) groups, and used as a reference (mv(mri)). for bi measurements of the trunk, the source electrodes were placed at the dorsal surface of the third metacarpal bone of both hands and the dorsal surface of the third metatarsal bone of both feet, and the detector electrodes were placed at the acromion process of both shoulders and the greater trochanter of both femurs. using this arrangement, the bi values of five parts of the trunk, both sides of the upper region, the middle region, and both sides of the lower region, were obtained and then used to calculate the whole trunk bi value and bi index (bi index(tr)). in the validation group, a simple regression analysis of the relationship between bi index(tr) and mv(mri) showed a significant correlation between the two variables (r = 0.884, p < 0.05) and produced a prediction equation with a se of estimation of 1,020.3 cm3 (8.5%). in the validation and cross-validation groups, there were no significant differences between the measured and estimated mv without systematic errors. these findings indicate that the segmental bi analysis employed in the present study can be used to estimate trunk mv.

physical activity among lung cancer survivors: changes across the cancer trajectory and associations with quality of life the american cancer society (acs) publishes nutrition and physical activity guidelines to serve as a foundation for its communication, policy, and community strategies and, ultimately, to affect dietary and physical activity patterns among americans. these guidelines, published approximately every 5 years, are developed by a national panel of experts in cancer research, prevention, epidemiology, public health, and policy, and they reflect the most current scientific evidence related to dietary and activity patterns and cancer risk. the acs guidelines focus on recommendations for individual choices regarding diet and physical activity patterns, but those choices occur within a community context that either facilitates or creates barriers to healthy behaviors. therefore, this committee presents recommendations for community action to accompany the 4 recommendations for individual choices to reduce cancer risk. these recommendations for community action recognize that a supportive social and physical environment is indispensable if individuals at all levels of society are to have genuine opportunities to choose healthy behaviors. the acs guidelines are consistent with guidelines from the american heart association and the american diabetes association for the prevention of coronary heart disease and diabetes, as well as for general health promotion, as defined by the 2010 dietary guidelines for americans and the 2008 physical activity guidelines for americans. ca cancer j clin 2012. © 2012 american cancer society.
specialization of binaural responses in ventral auditory cortices the acoustical cues for sound location are generated by spatial- and frequency-dependent filtering of propagating sound waves by the head and external ears. although rats have been a common model system for anatomy, physiology, and psychophysics of localization, there have been few studies of the acoustical cues available to rats. here, directional transfer functions (dtfs), the directional components of the head-related transfer functions, were measured in six adult rats. the cues to location were computed from the dtfs. in the frontal hemisphere, spectral notches were present for frequencies from approximately 16 to 30 khz; in general, the frequency corresponding to the notch increased with increases in source elevation and in azimuth toward the ipsilateral ear. the maximum high-frequency envelope-based interaural time differences (itds) were 130 mus, whereas low-frequency (<3.5 khz) fine-structure itds were 160 mus; both types of itds were larger than predicted from spherical head models. interaural level differences (ilds) strongly depended on location and frequency. maximum ilds were <10 db for frequencies <8 khz and were as large as 20-40 db for frequencies >20 khz. removal of the pinna eliminated the spectral notches, reduced the acoustic gain and ilds, altered the acoustical axis, and reduced the itds.
historical temperature variability affects coral response to heat stress the most severe outcome of coral bleaching is colony mortality. however, the risk of mortality is one of the least understood consequences for reef corals under climate-change scenarios. specifically, links among combinations of temperature anomalies, varying solar irradiance, reduced water quality, and mortality risks are unclear. here, we analyze the effects of high temperature, irradiance, and sediment loading on coral survivorship in a controlled tank experiment using acropora intermedia from the inner great barrier reef lagoon. survival analyses based on the fate of 1600 subcolonies revealed that temperature and sediment exerted strong effects on coral mortality risk. as expected, high temperature increased mortality risk at all light and sediment levels. however, high sediment reduced mortality under high temperature and/or high light, potentially by alleviating light pressure and by providing an alternative food source for bleached corals. a survivorship model using coral energy status (lipid stores) as a predictor variable provided an excellent fit to the data, suggesting that much of the variation in survivorship among treatments and over time can be explained by colony energetics. our study provides a new framework for predicting coral mortality risk under complex bleaching scenarios in which multiple environmental variables are involved.
emotional reactivity and its impact on neural circuitry for attention–emotion interaction in childhood and adolescence objective to examine the relation between specific frontostriatal structures (prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia) and response inhibition deficits observed in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd).   method children with adhd and age-matched normal controls were scanned using magnetic resonance imaging (mri) and tested on three response inhibition tasks. behavioral performance was correlated with mri-based anatomical measures of frontostriatal circuitry (prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia) implicated in adhd.   results first, significant differences in performance by children with adhd and normal volunteers were observed on all three response inhibition tasks. second, performance on these tasks correlated only with those anatomical measures of frontostriatal circuitry observed to be abnormal in children with adhd (e.g., the region of the prefrontal cortex, caudate, and globus pallidus, but not the putamen) in the authors' previous study. third, significant correlations between task performance and anatomical measures of the prefrontal cortex and caudate nuclei were predominantly in the right hemisphere, supporting a role of right frontostriatal circuitry in response inhibition and adhd.   conclusion the data suggest a role of the right prefrontal cortex in suppressing responses to salient, but otherwise irrelevant events while the basal ganglia appear to be involved in executing these behavioral responses.
does foreign entry spur innovation? while the role of exports in promoting growth in general, and productivity in particular, has been investigated empirically using aggregate data for countries and industries for a long time, only recently have comprehensive longitudinal data at the firm level been used to look at the extent and causes of productivity differentials between exporters and their counterparts which sell on the domestic market only. this paper surveys the empirical strategies applied, and the results produced, in 45 microeconometric studies with data from 33 countries that were published between 1995 and 2004. details aside, exporters are found to be more productive than non-exporters, and the more productive firms self-select into export markets, while exporting does not necessarily improve productivity.
a long-term comparison of carbon sequestration rates in impounded and naturally tidal freshwater marshes along the lower waccamaw river, south carolina we examine the carbon balance of north american wetlands by reviewing and synthesizing the published literature and soil databases. north american wetlands contain about 220 pg c, most of which is in peat. they are a small to moderate carbon sink of about 49 tg c yr−1, although the uncertainty around this estimate is greater than 100%, with the largest unknown being the role of carbon sequestration by sedimentation in freshwater mineral-soil wetlands. we estimate that north american wetlands emit 9 tg methane (ch4) yr−1; however, the uncertainty of this estimate is also greater than 100%. with the exception of estuarine wetlands, ch4 emissions from wetlands may largely offset any positive benefits of carbon sequestration in soils and plants in terms of climate forcing. historically, the destruction of wetlands through land-use changes has had the largest effects on the carbon fluxes and consequent radiative forcing of north american wetlands. the primary effects have been a reduction in their ability to sequester carbon (a small to moderate increase in radiative forcing), oxidation of their soil carbon reserves upon drainage (a small increase in radiative forcing), and reduction in ch4 emissions (a small to large decrease in radiative forcing). it is uncertain how global changes will affect the carbon pools and fluxes of north american wetlands. we will not be able to predict accurately the role of wetlands as potential positive or negative feedbacks to anthropogenic global change without knowing the integrative effects of changes in temperature, precipitation, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, and atmospheric deposition of nitrogen and sulfur on the carbon balance of north american wetlands.
psoriasis in a nationwide cohort study of patients with celiac disease. objectives to find out whether patients with psoriatic arthritis (psoa) have an increased prevalence of antibodies to gliadin (aga) and of coeliac disease.   methods one hundred and fourteen psoa patients with skin disease of 20+/-13 yr and joint disease of 11+/-10 yr duration answered a questionnaire concerning their medical history and underwent clinical examination, including radiology. serum iga aga and igg aga, iga antibodies to endomysium and immunoglobulins, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr) and c-reactive protein (crp) concentration were determined.   results five of the 114 patients (4.4%) had coeliac disease. after exclusion of these five patients, the mean iga aga concentration was significantly higher (p=0.0005) than that in a reference group. none of the patients had iga antibodies to endomysium. the mean serum iga concentration was significantly increased and igm decreased. patients with a high concentration of iga aga had significantly higher esr and crp and a longer duration of morning stiffness than those with a low aga concentration.   conclusions patients with psoa have an increased prevalence of raised serum iga aga and of coeliac disease. patients with raised iga aga seem to have more pronounced inflammation than those with a low iga aga concentration.
ptov1 is associated with uch-l1 and in response to estrogen stimuli during the mouse oocyte development abstract ptov1 is a mitogenic protein that shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in a cell cycle-dependent manner. it consists of two homologous domains arranged in tandem that constitute a new class of protein modules. we show here that ptov1 interacts with the lipid raft protein flotillin-1, with which it copurifies in detergent-insoluble floating fractions. flotillin-1 colocalized with ptov1 not only at the plasma membrane but, unexpectedly, also in the nucleus, as demonstrated by immunocytochemistry and subcellular fractionation of endogenous and exogenous flotillin-1. flotillin-1 entered the nucleus concomitant with ptov1, shortly before the initiation of the s phase. protein levels of ptov1 and flotillin-1 oscillated during the cell cycle, with a peak in s. depletion of ptov1 significantly inhibited nuclear localization of flotillin-1, whereas depletion of flotillin-1 did not affect nuclear localization of ptov1. depletion of either protein markedly inhibited cell proliferation under basal conditions. overexpression of ptov1 or flotillin-1 strongly induced proliferation, which required their localization to the nucleus, and was dependent on the reciprocal protein. these observations suggest that ptov1 assists flotillin-1 in its translocation to the nucleus and that both proteins are required for cell proliferation.
inhibition of semliki forest virus penetration by lysosomotropic weak bases. semliki forest virus was mixed with liposomes containing phosphatidylcholine,phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin, and cholesterol. when the ph of the mixture was dropped to 6 or below, rapid fusion between the membranes of the virus and the liposomes occurred, resulting in the transfer of viral nucleocapsids into the liposomes. fusion was demonstrated biochemically by trapping rnase or trypsin within the liposomes. trapped rnase digested the viral rna into acid-soluble form, providing a simple quantitative assay for fusion. trapped trypsin digested the viral capsid protein. fusion was also demonstrated by electron microscopy as the formation of large vesicles containing viral glycoproteins on the surface and nucleocapsids inside. the efficiency of fusion was 91 +/- 6%. in addition to low ph, it required that the viral glycoproteins be intact. in the target liposomes, cholesterol (but none of the individual phospholipids) was essential. divalent cations were not required. our previous studies with tissue culture cells indicated that the final step in the penetration of the semliki forest virus genome into host cells might involve a fusion event between the membrane of lysosomally trapped viruses and the lysosomal membrane [helenius, a., kartenbeck, j., simons, k. & fries, e. (1980) j. cell biol, 84, 404--420]. the data presented here are fully compatible with this hypothesis.
interpretable convolutional neural networks detecting objects becomes difficult when we need to deal with large shape deformation, occlusion and low resolution. we propose a novel approach to i) handle large deformations and partial occlusions in animals (as examples of highly deformable objects), ii) describe them in terms of body parts, and iii) detect them when their body parts are hard to detect (e.g., animals depicted at low resolution). we represent the holistic object and body parts separately and use a fully connected model to arrange templates for the holistic object and body parts. our model automatically decouples the holistic object or body parts from the model when they are hard to detect. this enables us to represent a large number of holistic object and body part combinations to better deal with different "detectability" patterns caused by deformations, occlusion and/or low resolution. we apply our method to the six animal categories in the pascal voc dataset and show that our method significantly improves state-of-the-art (by 4.1% ap) and provides a richer representation for objects. during training we use annotations for body parts (e.g., head, torso, etc.), making use of a new dataset of fully annotated object parts for pascal voc 2010, which provides a mask for each part.
hairpins participating in folding of human telomeric sequence quadruplexes studied by standard and t-remd simulations explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations have been used to complement preceding experimental and computational studies of folding of guanine quadruplexes (g-dna). we initiate early stages of unfolding of several g-dnas by simulating them under no-salt conditions and then try to fold them back using standard excess salt simulations. there is a significant difference between g-dnas with all-anti parallel stranded stems and those with stems containing mixtures of syn and anti guanosines. the most natural rearrangement for all-anti stems is a vertical mutual slippage of the strands. this leads to stems with reduced numbers of tetrads during unfolding and a reduction of strand slippage during refolding. the presence of syn nucleotides prevents mutual strand slippage; therefore, the antiparallel and hybrid quadruplexes initiate unfolding via separation of the individual strands. the simulations confirm the capability of g-dna molecules to adopt numerous stable locally and globally misfolded structures. the key point for a proper individual folding attempt appears to be correct prior distribution of syn and anti nucleotides in all four g-strands. the results suggest that at the level of individual molecules, g-dna folding is an extremely multi-pathway process that is slowed by numerous misfolding arrangements stabilized on highly variable timescales.
climatic forcing on channel profiles in the eastern cordillera of the coroico region, bolivia the bolivian andes flank one of earth’s major topographic features and dominate sediment input into the amazon basin. millennial-scale erosion rates and dominant controls on erosion patterns in this range are poorly known. to define these patterns, we present 48 erosion rate estimates, derived from analysis of in situ 10 be in quartz-bearing alluvium collected from the upper beni river basin. erosion rates, corrected for the non-uniform distribution of quartz in the sample basins, range from 0·04 mm a −1 to 1·35 mm a −1 and thus integrate over 10 2 ‐10 4 years. mean and modal values are 0·42 (standard deviation: 0·29) and 0·2‐0·4 mm a −1 respectively, within the range of long-term average erosion rates in this area derived from apatite fission track thermochronology (0·1‐0·6 mm a −1 ). hence, our data do not record any significant variation in erosion rate over the last several million years. mean and modal short-term erosion rates for the andes are an order of magnitude lower than rates in the ganges river headwaters in the high himalaya and an order of magnitude greater than rates typical of the european alps. in the upper beni river region of the bolivian andes, short-term, basin-averaged erosion rates correlate with normalized channel steepness index, a metric of relative channel gradient corrected for drainage area. neither normalized channel steepness index nor basin-averaged erosion rate shows strong correlation with mean basin hillslope gradient or mean basin local relief because many hillslopes in the upper beni river region are at threshold values of slope and local relief. patterns of normalized channel steepness index appear primarily to reflect tectonic patterns and transient adjustment to those patterns by channel networks. climate and lithology do not appear to exert first-order controls on patterns of basin-averaged erosion rates in the bolivian andes. copyright © 2005 john wiley & sons, ltd.
a community change in the algal endosymbionts of a scleractinian coral following a natural bleaching event: field evidence of acclimatization understanding whether or not corals have the flexibility to change their complement of symbionts to adapt to changing climate is an important goal in reef ecology studies. while host fidelity to a single clade of symbiont is the dominant pattern in present-day corals, current estimates of flexibility are unreliable, because few studies have measured it rigorously and with adequately sensitive genetic techniques. furthermore, flexibility must be explored at the level of the subclade, because generalisations of physiological performance among clades of symbiodinium are not valid. in addition, we should not necessarily expect to see shifts among symbionts without distinct and enduring changes in environmental conditions. the few biogeographical comparisons available suggest that when corals encounter a new environment they have the flexibility to acquire different symbionts. flexibility in the acquisition of symbionts is common at the time of infection, which in most corals occurs at, or shortly after, settlement. consequently, flexibility is likely to be a feature of the life history of all species that must reacquire symbionts in each new generation.
midbrain dopaminergic neuron fate specification: of mice and embryonic stem cells the homeobox gene otx2 is expressed in the anterior neural tube with a sharp limit at the midbrain/hindbrain junction (the isthmic organizer). otx2 inactivation experiments have shown that this gene is essential for the development of its expression domain. here we investigate whether the caudal limit of otx2 expression is instrumental in positioning the isthmic organizer and in specifying midbrain versus hindbrain fate, by ectopically expressing otx2 in the presumptive anterior hindbrain using a knock-in strategy into the en1 locus. transgenic offspring display a cerebellar ataxia. morphological and histological studies of adult transgenic brains reveal that most of the anterior cerebellar vermis is missing, whereas the inferior colliculus is complementarily enlarged. during early neural pattern formation expression of the midbrain markers wnt1 and ephrin-a5, the isthmic organizer markers pax2 and fgf-8 and the hindbrain marker gbx2 are shifted caudally in the presumptive hindbrain territory. these findings show that the caudal limit of otx2 expression is sufficient for positioning the isthmic organizer and encoding caudal midbrain fate within the mid/hindbrain domain.
identification of mycoparasitism-related genes against the phytopathogen sclerotinia sclerotiorum through transcriptome and expression profile analysis in trichoderma harzianum the trichoderma harzianum qid74 gene encodes a cysteine-rich cell wall protein that has an important role in adherence to hydrophobic surfaces and cellular protection; this gene was upregulated in trichoderma high-density oligonucleotide (hdo) microarrays in interaction with tomato roots. using a collection of qid74-overexpressing and disrupted mutants the role of this gene in cucumber and tomato root architecture was analysed in hydroponic and soil systems under greenhouse conditions. no significant differences were found in the pattern of root colonization and the length of primary roots of cucumber or tomato plants inoculated by t. harzianum cect 2413 wild-type (wt) strain or any of the qid74 transformants. however, compared to the wt treatment, lateral roots were significantly longer in plants inoculated with the overexpressing transformants, and shorter in those treated with the disruptant strains. microscopic observations revealed more and longer secondary root hairs in cucumber plants treated with the qid74-overexpressing mutants and fewer and shorter hairs in roots treated with qid74-disrupted transformants, compared to those observed in plants inoculated with the wt strain. qid74-induced modifications in root architecture increased the total absorptive surface, facilitating nutrient uptake and translocation of nutrients in the shoots, resulting in increased plant biomass through an efficient use of npk and micronutrients.
azoxystrobin causes oxidative stress and dna damage in the aquatic macrophyte myriophyllum quitense tobacco (nicotiana tabacum l. var. xanthi) seedlings were treated with aqueous solutions of lead nitrate (pb2+) at concentrations ranging from 0.4 mm to 2.4 mm for 24 h and from 25 microm to 200 microm for 7 days. the dna damage measured by the comet assay was high in the root nuclei, but in the leaf nuclei a slight but significant increase in dna damage could be demonstrated only after a 7-day treatment with 200 microm pb2+. in tobacco plants growing for 6 weeks in soil polluted with pb2+ severe toxic effects, expressed by the decrease in leaf area, and a slight but significant increase in dna damage were observed. the tobacco plants with increased levels of dna damage were severely injured and showed stunted growth, distorted leaves and brown root tips. the frequency of somatic mutations in tobacco plants growing in the pb2+-polluted soil did not significantly increase. analytical studies by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry demonstrate that after a 24-h treatment of tobacco with 2.4 mm pb2+, the accumulation of the heavy metal is 40-fold higher in the roots than in the above-ground biomass. low pb2+ accumulation in the above-ground parts may explain the lower levels or the absence of pb2+-induced dna damage in leaves.
geneseer: a sage for gene names and genomic resources ensembl (http://www.ensembl.org/) is a bioinformatics project to organize biological information around the sequences of large genomes. it is a comprehensive source of stable automatic annotation of individual genomes, and of the synteny and orthology relationships between them. it is also a framework for integration of any biological data that can be mapped onto features derived from the genomic sequence. ensembl is available as an interactive web site, a set of flat files, and as a complete, portable open source software system for handling genomes. all data are provided without restriction, and code is freely available. ensembl's aims are to continue to "widen" this biological integration to include other model organisms relevant to understanding human biology as they become available; to "deepen" this integration to provide an ever more seamless linkage between equivalent components in different species; and to provide further classification of functional elements in the genome that have been previously elusive.
a method for extracting a high-quality rna from symbiodinium sp. backgroundthe integrity of rna molecules is of paramount importance for experiments that try to reflect the snapshot of gene expression at the moment of rna extraction. until recently, there has been no reliable standard for estimating the integrity of rna samples and the ratio of 28s:18s ribosomal rna, the common measure for this purpose, has been shown to be inconsistent. the advent of microcapillary electrophoretic rna separation provides the basis for an automated high-throughput approach, in order to estimate the integrity of rna samples in an unambiguous way.methodsa method is introduced that automatically selects features from signal measurements and constructs regression models based on a bayesian learning technique. feature spaces of different dimensionality are compared in the bayesian framework, which allows selecting a final feature combination corresponding to models with high posterior probability.resultsthis approach is applied to a large collection of electrophoretic rna measurements recorded with an agilent 2100 bioanalyzer to extract an algorithm that describes rna integrity. the resulting algorithm is a user-independent, automated and reliable procedure for standardization of rna quality control that allows the calculation of an rna integrity number (rin).conclusionour results show the importance of taking characteristics of several regions of the recorded electropherogram into account in order to get a robust and reliable prediction of rna integrity, especially if compared to traditional methods.
shared filtering processes link attentional and visual short-term memory capacity limits. the capacity of visual short-term memory is highly limited, maintaining only three to four objects simultaneously. this extreme limitation necessitates efficient mechanisms to select only the most relevant objects from the immediate environment to be represented in memory and to restrict irrelevant items from consuming capacity. here we report a neurophysiological measure of this memory selection mechanism in humans that gauges an individual's efficiency at excluding irrelevant items from being stored in memory. by examining the moment-by-moment contents of visual memory, we observe that selection efficiency varies substantially across individuals and is strongly predicted by the particular memory capacity of each person. specifically, high capacity individuals are much more efficient at representing only the relevant items than are low capacity individuals, who inefficiently encode and maintain information about the irrelevant items present in the display. these results provide evidence that under many circumstances low capacity individuals may actually store more information in memory than high capacity individuals. indeed, this ancillary allocation of memory capacity to irrelevant objects may be a primary source of putative differences in overall storage capacity.
leading compounds for the validation of animal models of psychopathology approximately one half-century ago several classes of medications, discovered by serendipity, were introduced for the treatment of depression and bipolar disorder. these highly effective medications revolutionized our approach to mood disorders and helped launch the modern era of psychiatry. yet our progress since those serendipitous discoveries has been disappointing. we still do not understand with certainty how those medications produce their desired clinical effects. we have not introduced newer medications with fundamentally different mechanisms of action than the older agents. we have not identified the genetic and neurobiological mechanisms underlying depression and mania, nor do we understand the mechanisms by which nongenetic factors influence these disorders. we have only a rudimentary understanding of the circuits in the brain responsible for the normal regulation of mood and affect, and of those circuits that function abnormally in mood disorders. in approaching these gaps in our knowledge, this workgroup highlighted four major areas for future investment. these include developing better animal models of mood disorders; identifying genetic determinants of normal and abnormal mood in humans and animals; discovering novel targets and biomarkers of mood disorders and treatments; and increasing the recruitment of investigators from diverse backgrounds to mood disorders research.
shame and emotion regulation in inflammatory bowel disease: effects on psychosocial functioning abstract:extraintestinal manifestations (eim) in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) are frequent and may occur before or after ibd diagnosis. eim may impact the quality of life for patients with ibd significantly requiring specific treatment depending on the affected organ(s). they most frequently affect joints, skin, or eyes, but can also less frequently involve other organs such as liver, lungs, or pancreas. certain eim, such as peripheral arthritis, oral aphthous ulcers, episcleritis, or erythema nodosum, are frequently associated with active intestinal inflammation and usually improve by treatment of the intestinal activity. other eim, such as uveitis or ankylosing spondylitis, usually occur independent of intestinal inflammatory activity. for other not so rare eim, such as pyoderma gangrenosum and primary sclerosing cholangitis, the association with the activity of the underlying ibd is unclear. successful therapy of eim is essential for improving quality of life of patients with ibd. besides other options, tumor necrosis factor antibody therapy is an important therapy for eim in patients with ibd.
tools for traceable security verification abstract.ten years ago the mondex electronic purse was certified to itsec level e6, the highest level of assurance for secure systems. this involved building formal models in the z notation, linking them with refinement, and proving that they correctly implement the required security properties. the work has been revived recently as a pilot project for the international grand challenge in verified software. this paper records the history of the original project and gives an overview of the formal models and proofs used.
significant blockade of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases by mgcd516 (sitravatinib), a novel small molecule inhibitor, shows potent anti-tumor activity in preclinical models of sarcoma purpose the purpose of this trial was to assess the efficacy of imatinib in patients with one of 10 different subtypes of advanced sarcoma. patients and methods eligible patients were treated daily with imatinib dosed at 300 mg twice a day (for body-surface area > or = 1.5 m(2)). the primary end point was response (clinical benefit response [cbr]), defined as complete (cr) or partial response (pr) at 2 months, or stable disease, cr, or pr at 4 months. rules for early termination within each disease type were based on a bayesian hierarchical probability model (bhm) accounting for correlation of the responses of the 10 subtypes. available tissue samples were analyzed for molecules within the kit/platelet-derived growth factor receptor (pdgfr) signal transduction pathway. results one hundred eighty-five assessable patients with one of 10 subtypes of sarcoma were treated. one cr and three prs were achieved. a cbr was achieved in 28 patients treated overall and by subtype: two angiosarcomas (n = 16), 0 ewing (n = 13), one fibrosarcoma (n = 12), six leiomyosarcomas (n = 29), seven liposarcomas (n = 31), three malignant fibrous histiocytomas (n = 30), five osteosarcomas (n = 27), one malignant peripheral-nerve sheath tumor (n = 7), 0 rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 2), and three synovial sarcomas (n = 22). variable expression and mutations within the kit/pdgfr pathway were observed. conclusion this is the first phase ii study of a new agent in sarcoma to include sufficient patients with each of the common histologic subtypes to permit generalizable conclusions. the bhm is an effective method for studying rare diseases and their subtypes, when it is reasonable to assume that their response rates are exchangeable. although rare dramatic responses were seen, imatinib is not an active agent in advanced sarcoma in these subtypes.
anatomical specificity of the brain in the modulation of neuroglobin and cytoglobin genes after chronic bisphenol a exposure growing evidence suggests the causal link between the endocrine-disrupting chemicals (edcs) and the global obesity epidemics, in the context in the so-called “obesogenic environment”. dietary intake of contaminated foods and water, especially in association with unhealthy eating pattern, and inhalation of airborne pollutants represent the major sources of human exposure to edcs. this is of particular concern in view of the potential impact of obesity on chronic non-transmissible diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hormone-sensitive cancers. the key concept is the identification of adipose tissue not only as a preferential site of storage of edcs, but also as an endocrine organ and, as such, susceptible to endocrine disruption. the timing of exposure to edcs is critical to the outcome of that exposure, with early lifetime exposures (e.g., fetal or early postnatal) particularly detrimental because of their permanent effects on obesity later in life. despite that the mechanisms operating in edcs effects might vary enormously, this minireview is aimed to provide a general overview on the possible association between the pandemics of obesity and edcs, briefly describing the endocrine mechanisms linking edcs exposure and latent onset of obesity.
roles of phospho-gsk-3β in myocardial protection afforded by activation of the mitochondrial k atp channel. glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (gsk-3beta) is a multifunctional ser/thr kinase that plays important roles in necrosis and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. a major mechanism of cell necrosis is the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mptp), which consists of multiple protein subunits, including adenine nucleotide translocase (ant). the threshold for mptp opening is elevated by phosphorylation of gsk-3beta at ser9, which reduces activity of this kinase. how inactivation of gsk-3beta suppresses mptp opening has not been fully understood, but evidence to date suggests that preservation of hexokinase-ii in the mptp complex, inhibition of cyclophilin-d-ant binding, inhibition of p53 and inhibition of ant into the mitochondria are contributory. gsk-3beta phosphorylation is a step to which multiple protective signaling pathways converge, and thus gsk-3beta phosphorylation is crucial in cardioprotection of a variety of interventions against ischemia/reperfusion injury. apoptosis of cardiomyocytes by pressure overload or ischemia/reperfusion is also suppressed by inactivation of gsk-3beta, in which reduced phosphorylation of p53, heat shock factor-1 and myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1 and inhibition of bax translocation might be involved. considering predominant roles of gsk-3beta in cardiomyocyte death, manipulation of this protein kinase is a promising strategy for myocardial protection in coronary artery disease and heart failure.
prey-mediated effects of transgenic canola on a beneficial, non-target, carabid beetle transgenic crops that express genes targeted against insect pests may also affect non-target insects. for example, lacewings and monarch butterflies have been reported to be susceptible to toxins from bacillus thuringiensis (bt) that are expressed in bt transgenic plants, although these results were obtained in small-scale laboratory assays in which insects were exposed to high levels of transgenically expressed toxin in no-choice tests. we show here that the behaviour of non-target insects can also play a part in determining how their populations will be affected by bt plants.
improved outcomes associated with the use of intravenous acetaminophen for management of acute post-surgical pain in cesarean sections and hysterectomies abstract purpose: this retrospective study utilized a large, national hospital database to assess the impact of opioid–related adverse events (orade) on patient outcomes following selected surgical procedures known to require postoperative pain control. methods: outcomes of patients with administratively documented orade were compared to those without. multivariate regression determined differences in hospital costs; length of stay (los); odds of individuals being an outlier in total cost and los; and having a 30-day all-cause readmission. results: among 319,898 surgeries of interest, 12.2% of patients experienced an orade. patients had higher adjusted mean costs ($22,077 [95% ci 21,823–22,333] vs. $17,370 [95% ci 17,238–17,503]; p < 0.0001) and greater los (7.6 [95% ci 7.5–7.6] vs. 4.2 days [95% ci 4.2–4.2]; p <0.0001). adjusted odds of being a total cost and los outlier were 2.8 (95% ci 2.7–2.8) and 3.2 (95% ci 3.1–3.3) times greater in the orade group. these patients were more likely to be readmitted (or 1.06, 95% ci 1.02–1.09). conclusions: patients exhibiting a documented orade had greater overall costs, longer hospitalizations, and increased likelihood for readmission. these results highlight the economic impact associated with opioid use for postsurgical pain management.
erythroid progenitor cells expanded from peripheral blood without mobilization or preselection: molecular characteristics and functional competence we describe a new two-step culture method for mass production in vitro of erythroid cells from either cd34+ (10(5) cells/ml) or light-density (10(6) cells/ml) cells purified from the blood of normal donors and thalassemic patients. the method includes (i) culture of the cells in the presence of dexamethasone and estradiol (10(-6) m each) and (ii) the growth factors scf (50 ng/ml), il-3 (1 ng/ml), and epo (1 u/ml). in their proliferative phase, these cultures generated approximately 1.2 x 10(7) erythroblasts for each milliliter of blood collected from normal donors or thalassemic patients. they were composed mostly (90%) of cd45(low)/glycophorin (gpa)(neg)/cd71(1ow) cells at day 7, 50-60\% of which became cd45(neg)/gpa+/cd71high by days 15-20. however, when cells from days 7 to 12 of the proliferative phase were transferred in differentiation medium containing epo and insulin, they progressed to mature erythroblasts (g90% benzidine(pos) and cd45(neg)/gpa+/cd71medium) in 4 days. because of the high number of erythroid cells that are generated from modest volumes of blood, this method will prove useful in donor-specific studies of erythroid differentiation.
the ascorbic acid transporter svct2 is expressed in slow-twitch skeletal muscle fibres reactive oxygen species (ros) and redox state have emerged as physiological mediators, controlling blood coagulation and thrombosis. the redox balance is obviously linked to the presence of antioxidants; in particular, vitamin c appears to be a key modulator of platelet oxidative state, since these cells physiologically accumulate ascorbic acid and, moreover, platelet ascorbate plays a role during aggregation. here, we showed that platelets could compensate for fluctuations in ascorbate levels by modulating the expression of the na+-dependent transporter svct2. furthermore, the use of anucleated cells demonstrated, for the first time, that svct2 expression could be regulated at the translational level. the control of ascorbic acid uptake, through regulation of its carrier, was not only related to substrate availability, but it also occurred during platelet activation, which was accompanied by vitamin c deprivation and alteration in the redox state. finally, we showed that changes in intracellular ascorbic acid content had physiological relevance, since they modulate the surface sulfhydryl content and the thrombus viscoelastic properties. beside its role during aggregation, vitamin c may also have important effects during postaggregatory events.
the effect of transforming growth factor-β1 on nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells: insensitive to cell growth but functional to tgf-β/smad pathway abstract transforming growth factor (tgf)-β is a pleiotropic cytokine regulating a variety of cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, migration, cell adhesion, and immune response. in the well-understood classical tgf-β signaling pathway, tgf-β activates smad signalling via its two cell surface receptors such as tβrii and alk5/tβri, leading to smad-mediated transcriptional regulation. in addition, tgf-β may also activate other signaling pathways like mitogen-activated protein kinase, pi3k, etc. the signaling of tgf-β is finely regulated at different levels. inhibitory smads, including smad6 and smad7, are key regulators of tgf-β/bone morphogenetic protein (bmp) signaling by negative feedback loops. they can form stable complexes with activated type i receptors and thereby blocking the phosphorylation of r-smads, or recruit ubiquitin e3 ligases, such as smurf1/2, resulting in the ubiquitination and degradation of the activated type i receptors. besides, these inhibitory smad proteins also inhibit tgf-β/bmp signaling in the nucleus by interacting with transcriptional repressors, such as histone deacetylases, hoxc-8, and ctbp, or disrupting the formation of the tgf-β-induced functional smad-dna complexes. smad7 is in turn regulated by different stimuli, including tgf-β, ifn-γ, tnf-α as well as ultraviolet and tpa, and mediates the crosstalk between tgf-β and other signaling pathways. deregulation of smad7 expression has been associated with various human diseases, such as tissue fibrosis, inflammatory disease as well as carcinogenesis. overexpression of smad7 has been shown to antagonize tgf-β-mediated fibrosis, carcinogenesis, and inflammation, suggesting a therapeutic potential of smad7 to treat these diseases.
finite element modeling of short-wavelength folding on venus: implications for the plume hypothesis for crustal plateau formation crustal plateaus on venus constitute one of that planet’s most intriguing tectonic features. they host so-called “tessera” terrain, or deformed crust exhibiting two or more sets of intersecting tectonic lineaments, which comprises»8% of venus’ surface. major questions surrounding crustal plateaus and tessera terrain include: (1) what is the nature of crustal plateau deformation? what structures are present, and what are their spatial and temporal relations? (2) what is the global distribution of tessera terrain? does it form a global layer under the regional plains, cropping out in crustal plateaus, or is it confined to crustal plateaus? and (3) what are the implications of (1) and (2) for understanding the processes responsible for formation and deformation of crustal plateaus? structural and kinematic analyses reveal that deformation at ovda regio, venus largest crustal plateau, is characterized by linear shallow steep-sided troughs (ribbons), long arcuate long-wavelength folds, short mid-wavelength folds, and wide complex graben. temporal relations between structures lead to a three-phase regional strain history consisting of (1) layer-normal flattening of a thin competent membrane resulting in radially oriented, distributed extension (ribbon formation); (2) modest contraction of a thicker layer (concentric folding at plateau margins, interference folding in the plateau interior); and (3) limited extension localized at fold crests (graben formation). wavelength analysis of ribbons and folds places limits on the thickness of the competent layer during each stage of deformation and reflects an early shallow brittle‐ductile transition (bdt) that deepened with time. ovda’s deformation, topography, and gravity are all spatially correlated, strongly suggesting a genetic relationship between surface deformation and processes causing crustal thickening and plateau uplift. thus tessera terrain at ovda regio is likely confined to the topographically high plateau and does not extend beneath the surrounding regional plains. similar patterns persist at other crustal plateaus, indicating that tessera terrain is in general confined to crustal plateaus and does not form a globally continuous layer. ovda’s structures, their spatial and temporal relations, the resulting strain history, and the behavior of the bdt through time support a model of mantle plume upwelling in a thin lithospheric regime for crustal plateau formation and contradict previous downwelling models. similarities between structural and kinematic trends at ovda regio and other crustal plateaus lend support to this idea. c ∞ 1999 academic press
cep290 interacts with the centriolar satellite component pcm-1 and is required for rab8 localization to the primary cilium. bbs4 is one of several proteins that cause bardet-biedl syndrome (bbs), a multisystemic disorder of genetic and clinical complexity. here we show that bbs4 localizes to the centriolar satellites of centrosomes and basal bodies of primary cilia, where it functions as an adaptor of the p150glued subunit of the dynein transport machinery to recruit pcm1 (pericentriolar material 1 protein) and its associated cargo to the satellites. silencing of bbs4 induces pcm1 mislocalization and concomitant deanchoring of centrosomal microtubules, arrest in cell division and apoptotic cell death. expression of two truncated forms of bbs4 that are similar to those found in some individuals with bbs had a similar effect on pcm1 and microtubules. our findings indicate that defective targeting or anchoring of pericentriolar proteins and microtubule disorganization contribute to the bbs phenotype and provide new insights into possible causes of familial obesity, diabetes and retinal degeneration.
analysis of triaxial well-logging sensors in layered anisotropic earth formations early development of marine electromagnetic methods, dating back about 80 years, was driven largely by defense/military applications, and use for these purposes continues to this day. deepwater, frequency-domain, electric dipole-dipole, controlled-source electromagnetic csem methods arose from academic studies of the oceanic lithosphere in the 1980s, and although the hydrocarbon exploration industry was aware of this work, the shallow-water environments being explored at that time were not ideally suited for its use. low oil prices and increasingly successful results from 3d seismic methods further discouraged investment in costly alternative geophysical data streams. these circumstances changed in the late 1990s, when both statoil and exxonmobil began modeling studies and field
face recognition using 2.5d shape information previous work has demonstrated that the image variation of many objects (human faces in particular) under variable lighting can be effectively modeled by low-dimensional linear spaces, even when there are multiple light sources and shadowing. basis images spanning this space are usually obtained in one of three ways: a large set of images of the object under different lighting conditions is acquired, and principal component analysis (pca) is used to estimate a subspace. alternatively, synthetic images are rendered from a 3d model (perhaps reconstructed from images) under point sources and, again, pca is used to estimate a subspace. finally, images rendered from a 3d model under diffuse lighting based on spherical harmonics are directly used as basis images. in this paper, we show how to arrange physical lighting so that the acquired images of each object can be directly used as the basis vectors of a low-dimensional linear space and that this subspace is close to those acquired by the other methods. more specifically, there exist configurations of k point light source directions, with k typically ranging from 5 to 9, such that, by taking k images of an object under these single sources, the resulting subspace is an effective representation for recognition under a wide range of lighting conditions. since the subspace is generated directly from real images, potentially complex and/or brittle intermediate steps such as 3d reconstruction can be completely avoided; nor is it necessary to acquire large numbers of training images or to physically construct complex diffuse (harmonic) light fields. we validate the use of subspaces constructed in this fashion within the context of face recognition.
toxinotyping of necrotic enteritis-producing and commensal isolates of clostridium perfringens from chickens fed organic diets abstract necrotic enteritis is an enteric disease of avian species caused by the anaerobic bacterium clostridium perfringens. the disease is regularly controlled in the broiler chicken industry with antimicrobials in feed but is reemerging in areas such as europe where there is a ban on antimicrobials as growth promoters. to study prospective therapies, researchers must be able to reproduce this disease in a controlled environment, but this is not always possible because of differences in the pathogenicity of c. perfringens strains. our objective was to test the potential of five isolates (snecp43, 44, 47, 49, and 50), taken from field cases of necrotic enteritis, at recreating the disease in a controlled challenge experiment. snecp43 and 50 were derived from a common clone, with snecp50 passed in vivo and snecp43 subcultured in vitro. four hundred birds were divided into 16 pens, with three pens each receiving one of five treatments, with one control pen. day-old birds were raised on a high wheat-based diet to promote necrotic enteritis development and were challenged with between 3.4 × 109 and 3.2 × 1011 colony-forming units (cfu) of c. perfringens in feed for a period of 24 hr starting on day 13 of the challenge experiment. lesion scores were assessed on two birds per pen sacrificed on day 17 and on any dead birds during the 25-day study. growth performance was assessed up to 25 days, and mortality recorded throughout. only snecp50 produced necrotic enteritis mortalities significantly different (p ≤ 0.05) from the control. the five isolates were also typed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to assess their genetic relatedness. all epidemiologically unrelated isolates were deemed genetically unrelated, whereas snecp43 and 50 differed by only a single minor band. toxin type was assessed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr), which was also used for the detection of the gene encoding the β2-toxin.
front-face fluorescence spectroscopy as a tool to classify seven bovine muscles according to their chemical and rheological characteristics. this paper reports the potential of synchronous front-face fluorescence spectroscopy in the characterization at the molecular level of milk changes during mild heating from 4 to 50 °c and acidification in the ph range of 6.8 to 5.1. synchronous fluorescence spectra were collected in the 250–550 nm excitation wavelength range using offsets of 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, and 240 nm between excitation and emission monochromators. the potential of parallel factor (parafac) analysis in the decomposition of the whole synchronous fluorescence data set into the contribution of each of the fluorescent compounds present in milk has been investigated for heating and acidification data sets. models were fitted from 1 to 7 components. considering the core consistency values, parafac models with three components have been considered. the first three components explained 94.43% and 94.13% of the total variance for heating and acidification data sets, respectively. the loading profiles of the first and second components derived from parafac analysis performed on heating and acidification data sets corresponded quite well with the characteristics of tryptophan and vitamin a fluorescence spectra, respectively. the third component corresponded to the riboflavin fluorescence spectrum. considering the heating experiment, the profile of the concentration mode for the second component showed large variations according to the temperature, which were assigned to the melting of triglycerides between 4 and 50 °c. for the acidification experiment, drastic changes in the concentration modes of the three components were observed for ph below 5.6, in agreement with structural changes in casein micelles.
coding and non-coding variants in the shox2 gene in patients with early-onset atrial fibrillation atrial fibrillation (af) is the most common arrhythmia and is associated with increased morbidity. as the population ages and the prevalence of af continues to rise, the socioeconomic consequences of af will become increasingly burdensome. although there are well-defined clinical risk factors for af, a significant heritable component is also recognized. to identify the molecular basis for the heritability of af, investigators have used a combination of classical mendelian genetics, candidate gene screening, and genome-wide association studies. however, these avenues have, as yet, failed to define the majority of the heritability of af. the goal of this review is to describe the results from both candidate gene and genome-wide studies, as well as to outline potential future avenues for creating a more complete understanding of af genetics. ultimately, a more comprehensive view of the genetic underpinnings for af will lead to the identification of novel molecular pathways and improved risk prediction of this complex arrhythmia.
a compiler framework to detect parallelism in irregular codes in optimizing compilers, data structure choices directly influence the power and efficiency of practical program optimization. a poor choice of data structure can inhibit optimization or slow compilation to the point that advanced optimization features become undesirable. recently, static single assignment form and the control dependence graph have been proposed to represent data flow and control flow properties of programs. each of these previously unrelated techniques lends efficiency and power to a useful class of program optimizations. although both of these structures are attractive, the difficulty of their construction and their potential size have discouraged their use. we present new algorithms that efficiently compute these data structures for arbitrary control flow graphs. the algorithms use {\em dominance frontiers}, a new concept that may have other applications. we also give analytical and experimental evidence that all of these data structures are usually linear in the size of the original program. this paper thus presents strong evidence that these structures can be of practical use in optimization.
attentional states influence early neural responses associated with motivational processes: local vs. global attentional scope and n1 amplitude to appetitive stimuli event-related brain potentials (erps) provide high-resolution measures of the time course of neuronal activity patterns associated with perceptual and cognitive processes. new techniques for erp source analysis and comparisons with data from blood-flow neuroimaging studies enable improved localization of cortical activity during visual selective attention. erp modulations during spatial attention point toward a mechanism of gain control over information flow in extrastriate visual cortical pathways, starting about 80 ms after stimulus onset. paying attention to nonspatial features such as color, motion, or shape is manifested by qualitatively different erp patterns in multiple cortical areas that begin with latencies of 100-150 ms. the processing of nonspatial features seems to be contingent upon the prior selection of location, consistent with early selection theories of attention and with the hypothesis that spatial attention is "special."
minimizing makespan for the distributed hybrid flowshop scheduling problem with multiprocessor tasks this paper proposes a simple iterated greedy (ig) heuristic to minimize makespan in a multistage hybrid flowshop with multiprocessor tasks. to validate and verify the proposed heuristic, computational experiments have been conducted on two well-known benchmark problem sets. the experiment results clearly reveal that the proposed ig heuristic is highly effective as compared to three state-of-the-art meta-heuristics on the same benchmark instances.
kicking out the trolls - antecedents of social exclusion intentions in facebook groups we investigated how intentions to hide and unfriend facebook contacts were linked to perceived sender attractiveness and face-threating messages (ftas). intention to hide was higher than intention to unfriend contacts, implying that unfriending is harsher. low social attractiveness predicted hiding and unfriending intentions, but low physical attractiveness was only linked to hiding. disrespectful messages were linked to hiding contacts, while updates that made the receiver look bad were linked to unfriending. ftas also mediated the influence of social and physical attractiveness on hiding and unfriending contacts. overall, managing online relationships relied on independent and interdependent perceptual and behavioral processes.
impact of abiotic factor changes in blowfly, achoetandrus rufifacies (diptera: calliphoridae), in northern thailand the hairy maggot blow fly chrysomya rufifacies (macquart) (diptera: calliphoridae) has expanded its range in the united states since its introduction into texas (ca. 1980) and has been collected in 15 states. we investigated the bionomics of immature and adult c. rufifacies collected from carcasses of a raccoon procyon lotor (linnaeus) and white-tailed deer odocoileus virginianus zimmerman in upstate south carolina during november 2007, and used these insects to estimate the minimum period of insect activity. puparia of c. rufifacies were collected from deer carrion; 28% were parasitized by nasonia vitripennis (walker) (hymenoptera: pteromalidae). the mean daily ambient temperature during this study was 11.4+/-1.02 degrees c, representing the lowest recorded mean temperature for adult activity of c. rufifacies; adults of c. rufifacies were observed flying among the carcasses at 9.0 degrees c. although c. rufifacies is considered a warm-weather blow fly, researchers should be aware of its activity at suboptimal conditions, behavior that might aid its expansion into more northern areas.
reversible response of protein localization and microtubule organization to nutrient stress during drosophila early oogenesis. translational regulation of maternal mrnas in distinct temporal and spatial patterns underlies many key decisions in developing eggs and embryos. in drosophila, orb is responsible for mediating the translational activation of mrnas localized within the developing oocyte. orb is a germline-specific rna binding protein and is one of the founding members of the cpeb family of translational regulators. here we show that orb associates with the drosophila fragile x mental retardation (dfmr1) protein as part of a ribonucleoprotein complex that controls the localized translation of mrnas in developing egg chambers. one of the key orb regulatory targets is orb mrna, and this autoregulatory activity is critical for ensuring that orb protein is expressed at high levels in the oocyte. we show that dfmr1 functions as a negative regulator in the orb autoregulatory circuit, downregulating orb mrna translation.
cannabinoids inhibit neurodegeneration in models of multiple sclerosis. arachidonylethanolamide, an arachidonic acid derivative in porcine brain, was identified in a screen for endogenous ligands for the cannabinoid receptor. the structure of this compound, which has been named "anandamide," was determined by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and was confirmed by synthesis. anandamide inhibited the specific binding of a radiolabeled cannabinoid probe to synaptosomal membranes in a manner typical of competitive ligands and produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the electrically evoked twitch response to the mouse vas deferens, a characteristic effect of psychotropic cannabinoids. these properties suggest that anandamide may function as a natural ligand for the cannabinoid receptor.
sexual dimorphism in venom of bothrops jararaca(serpentes: viperidae). venom samples from four specimens of crotalus adamanteus from the same litter were analyzed for the content of a basic toxin by gel filtration. whereas the venoms of two snakes were essentially free of the toxin, two other contained about 5% and 11% toxin (w/w). the individual absence or presence of the toxin in the venom was constant, suggesting a genetically determined variation.
precise and efficient nucleotide substitution near genomic nick via noncanonical homology-directed repair. targeted genome editing technologies have enabled a broad range of research and medical applications. the cas9 nuclease from the microbial crispr-cas system is targeted to specific genomic loci by a 20 nt guide sequence, which can tolerate certain mismatches to the dna target and thereby promote undesired off-target mutagenesis. here, we describe an approach that combines a cas9 nickase mutant with paired guide rnas to introduce targeted double-strand breaks. because individual nicks in the genome are repaired with high fidelity, simultaneous nicking via appropriately offset guide rnas is required for double-stranded breaks and extends the number of specifically recognized bases for target cleavage. we demonstrate that using paired nicking can reduce off-target activity by 50- to 1,500-fold in cell lines and to facilitate gene knockout in mouse zygotes without sacrificing on-target cleavage efficiency. this versatile strategy enables a wide variety of genome editing applications that require high specificity.
improving software fault injection we describe how legacy c++ programs can be rejuvenated using c++11 features such as generalized constant expressions, perfect forwarding, and lambda expressions. in general, this work develops a correspondence between different kinds of macros and the c++ declarations to which they should be transformed. we have created a set of demacrofication tools to assist a developer in the rejuvenation of c++ programs. to evaluate the work, we have applied the rejuvenation tools to a number of c++ libraries to assess the extent to which these libraries might be improved by demacrofication. results indicate that between 68 and 98% of potentially refactorable macros could be transformed into c++11 declarations. additional experiments demonstrate why these numbers are not readily achieved using fully automated rejuvenation tools. we also discuss some techniques to further assist in automating rejuvenation process.
n‐ and c‐terminal degradation of ecdysteroid receptor isoforms, when transiently expressed in mammalian cho cells, is regulated by the proteasome and cysteine and threonine proteases backgroundmetamorphosis is a complex, highly conserved and strictly regulated development process that involves the programmed cell death of obsolete larval organs. here we show a novel functional role for the aspartic proteinase cathepsin d during insect metamorphosis.resultscathepsin d of the silkworm bombyx mori (bmcatd) was ecdysone-induced, differentially and spatially expressed in the larval fat body of the final instar and in the larval gut of pupal stage, and its expression led to programmed cell death. furthermore, bmcatd was highly induced in the fat body of baculovirus-infected b. mori larvae, suggesting that this gene is involved in the induction of metamorphosis of host insects infected with baculovirus. rna interference (rnai)-mediated bmcatd knock-down inhibited programmed cell death of the larval fat body, resulting in the arrest of larval-pupal transformation. bmcatd rnai also inhibited the programmed cell death of larval gut during pupal stage.conclusionbased on these results, we concluded that bmcatd is critically involved in the programmed cell death of the larval fat body and larval gut in silkworm metamorphosis.
improved image style transfer via cnn this is an undergraduate project in the geometric processing laboratory by : mark erlich & manually re-drawing an image in a certain artistic style takes a professional artist a long time. doing this for a video sequence single-handedly is beyond imagination. we present two computational approaches that transfer the style from one image (for example, a painting) to a whole video sequence. in our first approach, we adapt to videos the original image style transfer technique by gatys et al. based on energy minimization. we introduce new ways of initialization and new loss functions to generate consistent and stable stylized video sequences even in cases with large motion and strong occlusion. our second approach formulates video stylization as a learning problem. we propose a deep network architecture and training procedures that allow us to stylize arbitrary-length videos in a consistent and stable way, and nearly in real time. we show that the proposed methods clearly outperform simpler baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively. finally, we propose a way to adapt these approaches also to 360$$^\circ $$∘ images and videos as they emerge with recent virtual reality hardware.
necdin, a prader-willi syndrome candidate gene, regulates gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons during development. necdin is a potent growth suppressor that is expressed predominantly in postmitotic cells such as neurons and skeletal muscle cells. necdin shows a significant homology to mage (melanoma antigen) family proteins, all of which contain a large homology domain. mage-d1 (nrage, dlxin-1) interacts with the dlx/msx family homeodomain proteins via an interspersed hexapeptide repeat domain distinct from the homology domain. here we report that necdin associates with the msx homeodomain proteins via mage-d1 to modulate their function. in vitro binding and co-immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that mage-d1 directly interacted with necdin via the homology domain and msx1 (or msx2) via the repeat domain. a ternary complex of necdin, mage-d1, and msx2 was formed in vitro, and an endogenous complex containing these three proteins was detected in differentiating embryonal carcinoma cells. co-expression of necdin and mage-d1 released msx-dependent transcriptional repression. c2c12 myoblast cells that were stably transfected with msx2 cdna showed a marked reduction in myogenic differentiation, and co-expression of necdin and mage-d1 canceled the msx2-dependent repression. these results suggest that necdin and mage-d1 cooperate to modulate the function of dlx/msx homeodomain proteins in cellular differentiation.
communication about congenital adrenal hyperplasia: perspective of filipino families summarythe success of blood spot newborn screening in the usa led to early screening efforts in parts of the asia pacific region in the mid-1960s. while there were early screening leaders in the region, many of the countries with depressed and developing economies are only now beginning organized screening efforts. four periods of screening growth in the asia pacific region were identified. beginning in the 1960s, blood spot screening began in new zealand and australia, followed by japan and a cord blood screening programme for g6pd deficiency in singapore. in the 1980s, established programmes added congenital hypothyroidism and new programmes developed in taiwan, hong kong, china (shanghai), india and malaysia. programmes developing in the 1990s built on the experience of others developing more rapidly in korea, thailand and the philippines. in the 2000s, with limited funding support from the international atomic energy agency, there has been screening programme development around detection of congenital hypothyroidism in indonesia, mongolia, sri lanka, myanmar and pakistan. palau has recently contracted with the philippine newborn screening programme. there is little information available on newborn screening activities in nepal, cambodia, laos and the other pacific island nations, with no organized screening efforts apparent. since approximately half of the births in the world occur in the asia pacific region, it is important to continue the ongoing implementation and expansion efforts so that these children can attain the same health status as children in more developed parts of the world and their full potential can be realized.
identification and survival studies of mycobacterium tuberculosis within laboratory-fermented bovine milk a comparison of the dna sequence of the 16s rrna revealed a region in which there was a minor variation between the species of mycobacteria. this information was used to develop a multiplex amplification system that could identify the genus mycobacterium and then distinguish between m. avium and m. intracellulare, two commonly encountered mycobacteria other than tuberculosis. the combination of these rrna gene primers together with primers aimed at the mpb70 gene of m. tuberculosis complex organisms permits the detection and identification of clinically significant mycobacteria in a single tube. an amplification product of 1030 bp is indicative of the genus mycobacterium and smaller fragments of 850, 372, and 180 bp are the positive signals for m. intracellulare, m. tuberculosis complex, and m. avium, respectively.
sparc/osteonectin, an endogenous mechanism for targeting albumin to the blood–cerebrospinal fluid interface during brain development osteonectin (sparc, culture shock protein, bm-40) is a widely distributed glycoprotein which binds calcium and several extracellular matrix proteins, including interstitial collagens and thrombospondin, but whose physiologic role remains undefined. in the present studies, we have demonstrated that immunoreactive osteonectin is present in the distal cortical tubule and medullary tubules of murine kidney. we surveyed the renal epithelial cell lines llc-pk1, mdck, and ok for the expression of mrna encoding osteonectin. we found that osteonectin mrna is expressed by llc-pk1 and ok cells but not by mdck cells, as well as by adult kidney from several species. calcitonin and vasopressin, agents which increase camp in these cells, were found to decrease steady-state osteonectin mrna concentrations. we found that llc-pk1 cells produced osteonectin protein, that the protein was localized to intracellular granules, and that the protein bound hydroxyapatite in vitro. pulse-chase analysis revealed that osteonectin was secreted from the cell layer to the medium after a lag time of four to six hours and was secreted preferentially from the basolateral domain of the cell. the preferential secretion of the calcium-binding protein osteonectin from the renal epithelial cell is consistent with several possible functions, including a structural extracellular matrix protein, a participant in transepithelial ion transport, and an inhibitor of extracellular calcification.
the genetic architecture of climatic adaptation of tropical cattle we have developed an online catalog of snp-trait associations from published genome-wide association studies for use in investigating genomic characteristics of trait/disease-associated snps (tass). reported tass were common [median risk allele frequency 36%, interquartile range (iqr) 21%−53%] and were associated with modest effect sizes [median odds ratio (or) 1.33, iqr 1.20–1.61]. among 20 genomic annotation sets, reported tass were significantly overrepresented only in nonsynonymous sites [or = 3.9 (2.2−7.0), p = 3.5 × 10−7] and 5kb-promoter regions [or = 2.3 (1.5−3.6), p = 3 × 10−4] compared to snps randomly selected from genotyping arrays. although 88% of tass were intronic (45%) or intergenic (43%), tass were not overrepresented in introns and were significantly depleted in intergenic regions [or = 0.44 (0.34−0.58), p = 2.0 × 10−9]. only slightly more tass than expected by chance were predicted to be in regions under positive selection [or = 1.3 (0.8−2.1), p = 0.2]. this new online resource, together with bioinformatic predictions of the underlying functionality at trait/disease-associated loci, is well-suited to guide future investigations of the role of common variants in complex disease etiology.
working overtime: patterns of smartphone and pc usage in the day of an information worker the number of computing devices that people use is growing. to gain a better understanding of why and how people use multiple devices, we interviewed 27 people from academia and industry. from these interviews we distill four primary findings. first, associating a user's activities with a particular device is problematic for multiple device users because many activities span multiple devices. second, device use varies by user and circumstance; users assign different roles to devices both by choice and by constraint. third, users in industry want to separate work and personal activities across work and personal devices, but they have difficulty doing so in practice finally, users employ a variety of techniques for accessing information across devices, but there is room for improvement: participants reported managing information across their devices as the most challenging aspect of using multiple devices. we suggest opportunities to improve the user experience by focusing on the user rather than the applications and devices; making devices aware of their roles; and providing lighter-weight methods for transferring information, including synchronization services that engender more trust from users.
antagonizing deactivating cytokines to enhance host defense and chemotherapy in experimental visceral leishmaniasis in experimental leishmania donovani infection in balb/c mice, initial susceptibility gives way to t-cell-dependent acquired resistance and eventual control over visceral infection. since various cytokines appear to underlie the host response to leishmania infection, we examined infected liver tissue for gene expression of cytokines associated with th1 (gamma interferon [ifn-gamma] and interleukin-2 [il-2]) and th2 cells (il-4 and il-10). by northern (rna) blot analysis, only ifn-gamma mrna expression was detected in livers of infected euthymic mice. to determine whether activation of th1 cells develops selectively in this model, qualitative pcr analysis was used. these results indicated that mrnas for ifn-gamma, il-2, il-4, and il-10 were all induced by l. donovani infection. the potentially negative th2 cell-associated response did not appear to play a functional role, however, since resistance was acquired, anti-il-4 monoclonal antibody treatment did not accelerate control over visceral infection, and serum immunoglobulin e levels remained low. as judged by pcr analysis, il-4 and il-10 mrnas were also expressed under three other conditions without apparent effect: in naive euthymic mice treated with il-2, which induces leishmanicidal activity; in rechallenged immune mice, which resist reinfection; and in nude mice, which fail to control l. donovani. these results suggest that, like other leishmania species, l. donovani infection may trigger a potentially suppressive th2 cell-associated cytokine response. however, in t-cell-intact mice able to control l. donovani, this response either is insufficient to influence outcome or more likely is overshadowed by the th1 cell response.
0 time-varying discrete-time wavelet transforms time-varying filter banks and wavelets are studied and a design procedure is presented. in the resulting analysis-synthesis structures, the analysis filters and the corresponding synthesis filters, the number of bands, and the decimation rates can be changed with time. such structures can be considered as time-frequency overlapping block transforms. from this viewpoint, the tiling of the time-frequency plane and the corresponding basis functions are changed in time. the time-varying discrete wavelet transforms can be considered a special case of time-varying overlapping block transforms and are studied in detail. the formulation is based on the time domain formulation of time-varying analysis-synthesis structures. the design procedure can be used to design time-varying perfectly invertible transformations with a finite number of distinct analysis structures. for adaptive filter bank application, a least squares design method is also studied. >
efflux-pump-derived multiple drug resistance to ethambutol monotherapy in mycobacterium tuberculosis and the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ethambutol. besides an immediate cellular adaptation to stress, organisms can resist such challenges through changes in their genetic material. these changes can be due to mutation or acquisition of pre-evolved functions via horizontal transfer. in this chapter we will review evidence from bacterial genetics that suggests that the frequency of such events can increase in response to stress by activating mutagenic response (e.g. the sos response) and by inhibiting antimutagenic activities (e.g. mismatch repair system, mrs). natural selection, by favoring adaptations, can also select for the mechanism(s) that has/have generated the adaptive changes by hitchhiking. these mutator mechanisms can sometimes respond very specifically, though blindly, to the challenge of the environment. such stress-induced increases in mutation rates enhance genetic polymorphism, which is the structural component of the barrier to genetic exchange. since sos and mrs are the enzymatic controls of this barrier, the modulation of these systems can lead to a burst of speciation.
possible involvement of downregulation of the apelin-apj system in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. aims active autophagy has recently been reported in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity; here we investigated its pathophysiological role.   methods and results acute cardiotoxicity was induced in green fluorescent protein-microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (gfp-lc3) transgenic mice by administering two intraperitoneal injections of 10 mg/kg doxorubicin with a 3 day interval. a starvation group was deprived of food for 48 h before each injection to induce autophagy in advance. doxorubicin treatment caused left ventricular dilatation and dysfunction within 6 days. cardiomyocyte autophagy appeared to be activated in the doxorubicin group, based on lc3, p62, and cathepsin d expression, while it seemed somewhat diminished by starvation prior to doxorubicin treatment. unexpectedly, however, myocardial atp levels were reduced in the doxorubicin group, and this reduction was prevented by earlier starvation. electron microscopy revealed that the autophagic process was indeed initiated in the doxorubicin group, as shown by the increased lysosomes, but was not completed, i.e. autophagolysosome formation was rare. starvation prior to doxorubicin treatment partly restored autophagosome formation towards control levels. autophagic flux assays in both in vivo and in vitro models confirmed that doxorubicin impairs completion of the autophagic process in cardiomyocytes. the activities of both amp-activated protein kinase and the autophagy-initiating kinase unc-51-like kinase 1 (ulk1) were found to be decreased by doxorubicin, and these were restored by prior starvation.   conclusion prior starvation mitigates acute doxorubicin cardiotoxicity; the underlying mechanism may be, at least in part, restoration and further augmentation of myocardial autophagy, which is impaired by doxorubicin, probably through inactivation of amp-activated protein kinase and ulk1.
effect of nano-hydroxyapatite graft on socket healing after teeth extraction ( experimental study ) several techniques and materials have been suggested for alveolar ridge preservation (arp) after dental extraction and before implant placement. this literature review aimed to discuss the histological and clinical aspects of alveolar healing and the arp procedure after dental extraction and to verify whether it allows dental implant placement (with or without further augmentation). despite the heterogeneity of the studies, some evidence suggests that ridge preservation procedures are efficient in limiting the postextraction dimensional loss of the ridge and are accompanied by a different degree of bone regeneration, with varied amounts of residual graft material particles.
concomitant production of detergent compatible enzymes by bacillus flexus xju-1 abstract lipases, triacylglycerol hydrolases, are an important group of biotechnologically relevant enzymes and they find immense applications in food, dairy, detergent and pharmaceutical industries. lipases are by and large produced from microbes and specifically bacterial lipases play a vital role in commercial ventures. some important lipase-producing bacterial genera include bacillus, pseudomonas and burkholderia. lipases are generally produced on lipidic carbon, such as oils, fatty acids, glycerol or tweens in the presence of an organic nitrogen source. bacterial lipases are mostly extracellular and are produced by submerged fermentation. the enzyme is most commonly purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography, in addition to some modern approaches such as reverse micellar and aqueous two-phase systems. most lipases can act in a wide range of ph and temperature, though alkaline bacterial lipases are more common. lipases are serine hydrolases and have high stability in organic solvents. besides these, some lipases exhibit chemo-, regio- and enantioselectivity. the latest trend in lipase research is the development of novel and improved lipases through molecular approaches such as directed evolution and exploring natural communities by the metagenomic approach.
biodegradation in contaminated aquifers: incorporating microbial/molecular methods. stable isotope fractionation analysis of an aquifer heavily contaminated with benzene (up to 850 mg l(-1)) and toluene (up to 50 mg l(-1)) at a former hydrogenation plant in zeitz (saxonia, germany) has suggested that significant biodegradation of toluene was occurring. however, clear evidence of benzene biodegradation has been lacking at this site. determining the fate of benzene is often a determining factor in regulatory approval of a risk-based management strategy. the objective of the work described here was the demonstration of a new tool that can be used to provide proof of biodegradation of benzene or other organics by indigenous microorganisms under actual aquifer conditions. unique in situ biotraps containing bio-sep beads, amended with 13c-labeled or 12c nonlabeled benzene and toluene, were deployed at the zeitz site for 32 days in an existing groundwater monitoring well and used to collect and enrich microbial biofilms. lipid biomarkers or remaining substrate was extracted from the beads and analyzed by mass spectrometry and molecular methods. isotopic analysis of the remaining amounts of 13c-labeled contaminants (about 15-18% of the initial loading) showed no alteration of the 12c/13c ratio during incubation. therefore, no measurable exchange of labeled compounds in the beads by the nonlabeled compounds in the aquifer materials occurred. isotopic ratio analysis of microbial lipid fatty acids (as methyl ester derivatives) from labeled benzene- and toluene-amended biotraps showed 13c enrichment in several fatty acids of up to delta (13c) 13400%o, clearly verifying benzene and toluene biodegradation and the transformation of the labeled carbon into biomass by indigenous organisms under aquifer conditions. fatty acid profiles of total lipid fatty acids and the phospholipid fatty acid fraction and their isotopic composition showed significant differences between benzene- and toluene-amended biotraps, suggesting that different microbial communities were involved in the biodegradation of the two compounds.
overexpression of cyclins d1 and d3 during estrogen-induced breast oncogenesis in female aci rats. the cell cycle regulatory gene cyclin d1 is a candidate oncogene in breast cancer. it is overexpressed in 30-50% of invasive primary breast cancers and plays a key role in mediating mitogenic responses to steroids and growth factors in breast cancer cells in vitro. because the role of cyclin d1 in the proliferative and early noninvasive stages of breast cancer is largely unknown, we examined normal breast epithelium (nbe), proliferative disease (pd), ductal carcinoma in situ (dcis), and invasive carcinoma (ic) to evaluate the timing and possible importance of cyclin d1 expression in the development of breast cancer. using immunohistochemistry, we examined cyclin d1 protein expression in 471 breast tissue samples. a quantitative scoring system for immunohistochemistry based on percentage of positive cells was developed that correlated with western blot analysis of antigen concentration in paired samples (r2 = 0.91, p = 0.003). a sample was considered positive if >5% of relevant epithelial cells demonstrated nuclear staining. cyclin d1 positivity was observed in 11.7% (7 of 60) samples of nbe, 25% (11 of 44) of pd without atypia, 39.4% (13 of 33) of atypical ductal hyperplasia, 43.6% (17 of 39) of low-grade dcis, 47.9% (23 of 48) of high-grade dcis, and 48.3% (99 of 205) of ic. cyclin d1 expression was significantly higher in pd than nbe (p = 0.006) and in dcis than pd (p = 0.038). there was no significant increase from dcis to ic (p = 0.52). the increase in cyclin d1 expression in the overall progression from nbe to ic was also highly significant (p = 0.0001). therefore, cyclin d1 expression was detected at levels significantly greater than in nbe in the earliest proliferative epithelial lesions of the breast with a further significant increase accompanying the progression to any form of cancer. this suggests that overexpression of cyclin d1 protein is important at the earliest stages of breast oncogenesis and continues to have a crucial role throughout the development of malignancy.
ga3 content in young and mature antheridia of chara tomentosa estimated by capillary electrophoresis. summaryduring the development of the antheridia of chara species, dynamic changes in the occurrence and ultrastructure of plasmodesmata are observed which are closely correlated to particular developmental phases and presumably regulate the morphogenetic events in the antheridia. the disappearance of plasmodesmata between shield cells and between shied cells and the basal cell leads to a cessation in symplasmic transport around the antheridum and determines its concentric or centrifugal character via centrally situated capitular cells. unplugged plasmodesmata are present between fully synchronously developing antheridial filament cells and obviously coordinate the development of the cells. in the middle phase of spermiogenesis, rough endoplasmic reticulum in antheridial filaments passes uncompressed through wide plasmodesmata and provides an additional transport pathway for developmental control factors. plugged plasmodesmata link cells of different types or cells of the same type which are at different phases of cell cycle and guarantee their individual development. the plugging of plasmodesmata is a reversible process that depends on the morphogenetic situation. plasmodesmata connecting the basal cell and the subbasal cell as well as the basal cell and capitular cells are transformed successively from the simple into the complex type and might be the pathways for an import of gibberellins and nutrients into the strong sink tissues of the developing antheridium. there is a symplasmic connection between the antheridum and the thallus via a basal cell. prior to the initiation of spermatozoid differentiation (spermiogenesis), plasmodesmata connecting the basal cell with a subbasal cell and the basal cell with capitular cells are spontaneously broken, resulting in symplasmic isolation of the antheridium that is probably a signal which triggers the induction of spermatozoid differentiation. premature plasmolytically evoked symplasmic isolation of the antheridium leads to the elimination of 1 to 2 cell cycles from the proliferative stage of spermatogenesis. autoradiographic studies demonstrate that both natural and induced symplasmic isolation drastically decreases the entry of isotopically labeled gibberellic acid into antheridia of chara species that may be the consequence of the elimination of the hormone's transport through plasmodesmata.
neighborhood context and immigrant children's physical activity. context research examining the association between environmental attributes and physical activity among youth is growing. an updated review of literature is needed to summarize the current evidence base, and to inform policies and environmental interventions to promote active lifestyles among young people.   evidence acquisition a literature search was conducted using the active living research (alr) literature database, an online database that codes study characteristics and results of published papers on built/social environment and physical activity/obesity/sedentary behavior. papers in the alr database were identified through pubmed, web of science, and sportdiscus using systematically developed and expert-validated search protocols. for the current review, additional inclusion criteria were used to select observational, quantitative studies among youth aged 3-18 years.   evidence synthesis papers were categorized by design features, sample characteristics, and measurement mode. relevant results were summarized, stratified by age (children or adolescents) and mode of measurement (objective or perceived) for environmental attributes and physical activity. percentage of significant results was calculated.   conclusions mode of measurement greatly influenced the consistency of associations between environmental attributes and youth physical activity. for both children and adolescents, the most consistent associations involved objectively measured environmental attributes and reported physical activity. the most supported correlates for children were walkability, traffic speed/volume, access/proximity to recreation facilities, land-use mix, and residential density. the most supported correlates for adolescents were land-use mix and residential density. these findings support several recommendations for policy and environmental change from such groups as the iom and national physical activity plan.
predictive value of a profile of routine blood measurements on mortality in older persons in the general population: the leiden 85-plus study background a high total serum cholesterol level does not carry a risk of cardiovascular mortality among people 85 years and older and is related to decreased all-cause mortality. at this old age, there are few data on fractionated lipoprotein levels in the determination of cardiovascular disease risk. the aim of this study was to evaluate the relationships between low-density lipoprotein (ldl) and high-density lipoprotein (hdl) cholesterol levels and mortality from specific causes among people in the oldest age categories.   methods between september 1, 1997, and september 1, 1999, a total of 705 inhabitants in the community of leiden, the netherlands, reached the age of 85 years. among these old people, we initiated a prospective follow-up study to investigate determinants of successful aging. a total of 599 subjects participated (response rate, 87%) and all were followed up to september 2001. serum levels of total, ldl, and hdl cholesterol were assessed at baseline along with detailed information on comorbid conditions. the main outcome measure was all-cause and specific mortality risk.   results during 4 years of follow-up, 152 subjects died. the leading cause of death was cardiovascular disease, with similar mortality risks in all tertiles of ldl cholesterol level. in contrast, low hdl cholesterol level was associated with a 2.0-fold higher risk of fatal cardiovascular disease (95% confidence interval [ci], 1.2-3.2). the mortality risk of coronary artery disease was 2.0 (95% ci, 1.0-3.9) and for stroke it was 2.6 (95% ci, 1.0-6.6). both low ldl cholesterol and low hdl cholesterol concentrations were associated with an increased mortality risk of infection: 2.7 (95% ci, 1.2-6.2) and 2.4 (95% ci, 1.1-5.6), respectively. the risks were unaffected by comorbidity.   conclusion in contrast to high ldl cholesterol level, low hdl cholesterol level is a risk factor for mortality from coronary artery disease and stroke in old age.
mercury and selenium biomagnification in a brazilian coastal food web using nitrogen stable isotope analysis: a case study in an area under the influence of the paraiba do sul river plume. concentrations of trace elements (v, cr, mn, fe, co, cu, zn, ga, as, se, rb, sr, mo, ag, cd, sb, cs, ba, t-hg, org-hg, tl and pb) were determined in liver samples of estuarine dolphin (sotalia guianensis; n = 20), franciscana dolphin (pontoporia blainvillei; n = 23), atlantic spotted dolphin (stenella frontalis; n = 2), common dolphin (delphinus capensis; n = 1) and striped dolphin (stenella coeruleoalba; n = 1) incidentally caught along the coast of sao paulo state and parana state, brazil, from 1997 to 1999. the hepatic concentrations of trace elements in the brazilian cetaceans were comparable to the data available in literature on marine mammals from northern hemisphere. concentrations of v, se, mo, cd, t-hg and org-hg increased with increasing age in liver of both estuarine and franciscana dolphins. very high concentrations of cu (range, 262-1970 microg/g dry wt.) and zn (range, 242-369 microg/g dry wt.) were observed in liver of sucklings of estuarine dolphin. hepatic concentrations of v, se, t-hg, org-hg and pb were significantly higher in estuarine dolphin, whereas franciscana dolphin showed higher concentrations of mn, co, as and rb. ratio of org-hg to t-hg in liver was significantly higher in franciscana dolphin than estuarine dolphin, suggesting that demethylation ability of methyl hg might be lower in liver of franciscana than estuarine dolphins. high hepatic concentrations of ag were found in some specimens of franciscana dolphin (maximum, 20 microg/g dry wt.), and 17% of franciscana showed higher concentrations of ag than hg. these samples with high ag concentration also exhibited elevated hepatic se concentration, implying that ag might be detoxified by se in the liver. higher correlation coefficient between (hg+0.5 ag) and se than between hg and se and the large distribution of ag in non-soluble fraction in nuclear and mitochondrial fraction of the liver also suggests that ag might be detoxified by se via formation of ag2se in the liver of franciscana dolphin.
epigenomic profiling reveals an association between persistence of dna methylation and metabolic memory in the dcct/edic type 1 diabetes cohort background—epigenetic mechanisms might be involved in the regulation of interindividual lipid level variability and thus may contribute to the cardiovascular risk profile. the aim of this study was to investigate the association between genome-wide dna methylation and blood lipid levels high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and total cholesterol. observed dna methylation changes were also further analyzed to examine their relationship with previous hospitalized myocardial infarction. methods and results—genome-wide dna methylation patterns were determined in whole blood samples of 1776 subjects of the cooperative health research in the region of augsburg f4 cohort using the infinium humanmethylation450 beadchip (illumina). ten novel lipid-related cpg sites annotated to various genes including abcg1, mir33b/srebf1, and tnip1 were identified. cpg cg06500161, located in abcg1, was associated in opposite directions with both high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (&bgr; coefficient=−0.049; p=8.26e-17) and triglyceride levels (&bgr;=0.070; p=1.21e-27). eight associations were confirmed by replication in the cooperative health research in the region of augsburg f3 study (n=499) and in the invecchiare in chianti, aging in the chianti area study (n=472). associations between triglyceride levels and srebf1 and abcg1 were also found in adipose tissue of the multiple tissue human expression resource cohort (n=634). expression analysis revealed an association between abcg1 methylation and lipid levels that might be partly mediated by abcg1 expression. dna methylation of abcg1 might also play a role in previous hospitalized myocardial infarction (odds ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval=1.06–1.25). conclusions—epigenetic modifications of the newly identified loci might regulate disturbed blood lipid levels and thus contribute to the development of complex lipid-related diseases.
phenolic compounds in norway spruce as affected by boron nutrition at the end of the growing season boron, as borate, appears to have a role in partitioning metabolism between the glycolytic and pentose-shunt pathways. this effect results from the association of borate with 6-phosphogluconic acid, forming a virtual substrate that inhibits the action of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. in the absence of borate, the inhibition of the enzyme is released, and excess phenolic acids are formed. these acids also associate strongly with borate and thus develop an autocatalytic system for production of excess phenolic acids which cause necrosis of tissue and eventual death of the plant.
effect of selenium supplementation on lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzymes, and lactate levels in rats immediately after acute swimming exercise dietary intake of selenium has been implicated in a wide range of health issues, including aging, heart disease and cancer. selenium deficiency, which can reduce selenoprotein levels, has been associated with several striated muscle pathologies. to investigate the role of selenoproteins in skeletal muscle biology, we used a transgenic mouse (referred to as i6a-) that has reduced levels of selenoproteins due to the introduction and expression of a dominantly acting mutant form of selenocysteine transfer rna (trna[ser]sec). as a consequence, each organ contains reduced levels of most selenoproteins, yet these mice are normal with regard to fertility, overall health, behavior and blood chemistries. in the present study, although skeletal muscles from i6a- mice were phenotypically indistinguishable from those of wild-type mice, plantaris muscles were approximately 50% heavier after synergist ablation, a model of exercise overload. like muscle in wild-type mice, the enhanced growth in the i6a- mice was completely blocked by inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) pathway. muscles of transgenic mice exhibited increased site-specific phosphorylation on both akt and p70 ribosomal s6 kinase (p70s6k) (p < 0.05) before ablation, perhaps accounting for the enhanced response to synergist ablation. thus, a single genetic alteration resulted in enhanced skeletal muscle adaptation after exercise, and this is likely through subtle changes in the resting phosphorylation state of growth-related kinases.
ionizing irradiation induces apoptotic damage of salivary gland acinar cells via nadph oxidase 1-dependent superoxide generation. human whole saliva contains a number of antimicrobial agents, and lysozyme, lactoferrin, secretory iga and peroxidase are among the best known. peroxidase catalyzes a reaction involved in the inhibition of bacterial growth and metabolism, and the prevention of hydrogen peroxide accumulation, thus protecting proteins from the action of oxygen and reactive oxygen species (ros). to better understand the role played by the oxidative stress in the aging process, we studied the relationship between total protein content, peroxidase activity, malondialdehyde (mda) and nitric oxide (no) content of human unstimulated whole saliva in 169 healthy subjects subdivided into groups according to age. our results show a significant decrease in peroxidase activity with age. moreover, the increase in saliva lipid peroxide levels indicates an enhanced free radical production that may contribute to tissue damage. on the other hand, findings concerning human unstimulated whole saliva no content showed a significant increase in elderly subjects, suggesting that an enhanced no production might depend on a stimulation of leukocyte-inducible no synthase (i-nos) activity. our results suggest that during aging the oral tissues may become more susceptible to environmental factors due to a modification in the balance between different antimicrobial agents.
interpretable convolutional neural networks detecting objects becomes difficult when we need to deal with large shape deformation, occlusion and low resolution. we propose a novel approach to i) handle large deformations and partial occlusions in animals (as examples of highly deformable objects), ii) describe them in terms of body parts, and iii) detect them when their body parts are hard to detect (e.g., animals depicted at low resolution). we represent the holistic object and body parts separately and use a fully connected model to arrange templates for the holistic object and body parts. our model automatically decouples the holistic object or body parts from the model when they are hard to detect. this enables us to represent a large number of holistic object and body part combinations to better deal with different "detectability" patterns caused by deformations, occlusion and/or low resolution. we apply our method to the six animal categories in the pascal voc dataset and show that our method significantly improves state-of-the-art (by 4.1% ap) and provides a richer representation for objects. during training we use annotations for body parts (e.g., head, torso, etc.), making use of a new dataset of fully annotated object parts for pascal voc 2010, which provides a mask for each part.
noscapine recirculates enterohepatically and induces self-clearance. abstract noscapine, a phthalideisoquinoline alkaloid derived from opium, has been used as an oral anti-tussive agent and has shown very few toxic effects in animals or humans. recently, we reported that noscapine binds stoichiometrically to tubulin and promotes microtubule polymerization. noscapine causes growth arrest of tumor cells in mitosis and induces apoptosis of tumor cells in vitro. previous experiments also showed that noscapine has potent antitumor activity in mice when administered parenterally or by gastric lavage. here, we report that the anti-mitotic effect was specific to noscapine since closely related compounds did not inhibit the growth of a lymphoma cell line. in addition, noscapine was shown to be effective in reducing the growth of the lymphoma and increasing the survival of tumor-bearing mice when administered in the drinking water. it is noteworthy that, noscapine showed little or no toxicity to kidney, liver, heart, bone marrow, spleen or small intestine at tumor-suppressive doses. furthermore, oral noscapine did not inhibit primary immune responses, which are critically dependent upon proliferation of lymphoid cells. thus, our results indicate that noscapine has the potential to be an effective chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of human cancer.
actigraph accelerometer-defined boundaries for sedentary behaviour and physical activity intensities in 7 year old children objective this study was designed to validate accelerometer-based activity monitors against energy expenditure (ee) in children; to compare monitor placement sites; to field-test the monitors; and to establish sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous threshold counts.   research methods and procedures computer science and applications actigraph (csa) and mini-mitter actiwatch (mm) monitors, on the hip or lower leg, were validated and calibrated against 6-hour ee measurements by room respiration calorimetry, activity by microwave detector, and heart rate by telemetry in 26 children, 6 to 16 years old. during the 6 hours, the children performed structured activities, including resting metabolic rate (rmr), nintendo, arts and crafts, aerobic warm-up, tae bo, treadmill walking and running, and games. activity energy expenditure (aee) computed as ee - rmr was regressed against counts to derive threshold counts.   results the mean correlations between ee or aee and counts were slightly higher for mm-hip (r = 0.78 +/- 0.06) and mm-leg (r = 0.80 +/- 0.05) than csa-hip (r = 0.66 +/- 0.08) and csa-leg (r = 0.73 +/- 0.07). csa and mm performed similarly on the hip (inter-instrument r = 0.88) and on the lower leg (inter-instrument r = 0.89). threshold counts for the csa-hip were <800, <3200, <8200, and > or = 8200 for sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous categories, respectively. for the mm-hip, the threshold counts were <100, <900, <2200, and > or = 2200, respectively.   discussion the validation of the csa and mm monitors against aee and their calibration for sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous thresholds certify these monitors as valid, useful devices for the assessment of physical activity in children.
embryoid body formation of human amniotic fluid stem cells depends on mtor the target of rapamycin (tor) is a conserved ser/thr kinase that regulates cell growth and metabolism in response to environmental cues. here, highlighting contributions from studies in model organisms, we review mammalian tor complexes and the signaling branches they mediate. tor is part of two distinct multiprotein complexes, tor complex 1 (torc1), which is sensitive to rapamycin, and torc2, which is not. the physiological consequences of mammalian torc1 dysregulation suggest that inhibitors of mammalian tor may be useful in the treatment of cancer, cardiovascular disease, autoimmunity, and metabolic disorders.
up to 92 % increase of cancer-preventing lunasin in organic spring barley background the health benefits of organic foods are unclear.   purpose to review evidence comparing the health effects of organic and conventional foods.   data sources medline (january 1966 to may 2011), embase, cab direct, agricola, toxnet, cochrane library (january 1966 to may 2009), and bibliographies of retrieved articles.   study selection english-language reports of comparisons of organically and conventionally grown food or of populations consuming these foods.   data extraction 2 independent investigators extracted data on methods, health outcomes, and nutrient and contaminant levels.   data synthesis 17 studies in humans and 223 studies of nutrient and contaminant levels in foods met inclusion criteria. only 3 of the human studies examined clinical outcomes, finding no significant differences between populations by food type for allergic outcomes (eczema, wheeze, atopic sensitization) or symptomatic campylobacter infection. two studies reported significantly lower urinary pesticide levels among children consuming organic versus conventional diets, but studies of biomarker and nutrient levels in serum, urine, breast milk, and semen in adults did not identify clinically meaningful differences. all estimates of differences in nutrient and contaminant levels in foods were highly heterogeneous except for the estimate for phosphorus; phosphorus levels were significantly higher than in conventional produce, although this difference is not clinically significant. the risk for contamination with detectable pesticide residues was lower among organic than conventional produce (risk difference, 30% [ci, -37% to -23%]), but differences in risk for exceeding maximum allowed limits were small. escherichia coli contamination risk did not differ between organic and conventional produce. bacterial contamination of retail chicken and pork was common but unrelated to farming method. however, the risk for isolating bacteria resistant to 3 or more antibiotics was higher in conventional than in organic chicken and pork (risk difference, 33% [ci, 21% to 45%]).   limitation studies were heterogeneous and limited in number, and publication bias may be present.   conclusion the published literature lacks strong evidence that organic foods are significantly more nutritious than conventional foods. consumption of organic foods may reduce exposure to pesticide residues and antibiotic-resistant bacteria.   primary funding source none.
application of mih for the lightweight deployment of lte-advanced systems through mobile relaying the performance of current internet applications is based mainly on the capabilities of the underlying network technologies. modern access systems usually can satisfy delay, loss, or bandwidth requirements; however, design inconsistencies can lead to service degradation as the terminals move across different systems. in this article, the focal point is the satisfaction of service requirements during mobility and more specifically, how the emerging ieee 802.21 standard enables seamless, inter-technology handover. based on prior work and a well-known example of seamless mobility, the main seamless mobility principles are identified and used as the basis for further evaluating the potential of the ieee 802.21 standard to meet the requirements of applications for minimum disruption during an inter-technology handover.
lgr5+ amacrine cells possess regenerative potential in the retina of adult mice it was previously reported that the ciliary epithelium (ce) of the mammalian eye contains a rare population of cells that could produce clonogenic self-renewing pigmented spheres in culture. based on their ability to up-regulate genes found in retinal neurons, it was concluded that these sphere-forming cells were retinal stem cells. this conclusion raised the possibility that ce-derived retinal stem cells could help to restore vision in the millions of people worldwide who suffer from blindness associated with retinal degeneration. we report here that human and mouse ce-derived spheres are made up of proliferating pigmented ciliary epithelial cells rather than retinal stem cells. all of the cells in the ce-derived spheres, including the proliferating cells, had molecular, cellular, and morphological features of differentiated pigmented ce cells. these differentiated cells ectopically expressed nestin when exposed to growth factors and low levels of pan-neuronal markers such as beta-iii-tubulin. although the cells aberrantly expressed neuronal markers, they retained their pigmented ce cell morphology and failed to differentiate into retinal neurons in vitro or in vivo. our results provide an example of a differentiated cell type that can form clonogenic spheres in culture, self-renew, express progenitor cell markers, and initiate neuronal differentiation that is not a stem or progenitor cell. more importantly, our findings highlight the importance of shifting the focus away from studies on ce-derived spheres for cell-based therapies to restore vision in the degenerating retina and improving techniques for using es cells or retinal precursor cells.
cyberknife radiosurgery for the treatment of intraocular and periocular lymphoma. immunodysregulation appears to play a prominent role in the evolution of some lymphomas, as evidenced by the strong associations between congenital and acquired immunodeficiencies and lymphoid neoplasia, and abnormal ratios of helper t cells in lymphoid proliferations. lympho-proliferative diseases of the ocular adnexa encompass a spectrum of lesions that may present with similar clinical and radiological features. most primary lymphoid proliferations of the ocular adnexa consist of small lymphocytes of b-cell origin. employing morphological, immunohistochemical, and molecular genetic criteria, proliferations may be separated into polyclonal and monoclonal categories. increased insight into the biology and behavior of these tumors tells us that seemingly benign, as well as frankly malignant proliferations, might disseminate to nodal or extranodal sites. the diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disease of any type necessitates a complete workup for systemic lymphoma. major prognostic criteria for lymphomas are anatomical site, stage, and histological features. radiotherapy is employed for localized lymphoid proliferations, with chemotherapy recommended for disseminated disease. long-term follow-up with semiannual examination is recommended. a significant percentage of primary ocular adnexal lymphoid lesions are malt-type lymphomas, extranodal low-grade b-cell lymphomas usually associated with mucosal tissues or glandular epithelia. the pathogenesis of this lymphoma in orbital soft tissue, which normally is devoid of lymphoid tissue, lymphatic vessels, and epithelium, is unclear. malt-type lymphomas of the ocular adnexa follow an indolent course, with long periods between relapses, and are responsive to therapy. dissemination, when it occurs, preferentially affects other extranodal sites.
two at once: enhancing learning and generalization capacities via ibn-net deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. we present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. we explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. we provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. on the imagenet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8× deeper than vgg nets [40] but still having lower complexity. an ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the imagenet test set. this result won the 1st place on the ilsvrc 2015 classification task. we also present analysis on cifar-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. the depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the coco object detection dataset. deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ilsvrc & coco 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of imagenet detection, imagenet localization, coco detection, and coco segmentation.

climatic forcing on channel profiles in the eastern cordillera of the coroico region, bolivia the bolivian andes flank one of earth’s major topographic features and dominate sediment input into the amazon basin. millennial-scale erosion rates and dominant controls on erosion patterns in this range are poorly known. to define these patterns, we present 48 erosion rate estimates, derived from analysis of in situ 10 be in quartz-bearing alluvium collected from the upper beni river basin. erosion rates, corrected for the non-uniform distribution of quartz in the sample basins, range from 0·04 mm a −1 to 1·35 mm a −1 and thus integrate over 10 2 ‐10 4 years. mean and modal values are 0·42 (standard deviation: 0·29) and 0·2‐0·4 mm a −1 respectively, within the range of long-term average erosion rates in this area derived from apatite fission track thermochronology (0·1‐0·6 mm a −1 ). hence, our data do not record any significant variation in erosion rate over the last several million years. mean and modal short-term erosion rates for the andes are an order of magnitude lower than rates in the ganges river headwaters in the high himalaya and an order of magnitude greater than rates typical of the european alps. in the upper beni river region of the bolivian andes, short-term, basin-averaged erosion rates correlate with normalized channel steepness index, a metric of relative channel gradient corrected for drainage area. neither normalized channel steepness index nor basin-averaged erosion rate shows strong correlation with mean basin hillslope gradient or mean basin local relief because many hillslopes in the upper beni river region are at threshold values of slope and local relief. patterns of normalized channel steepness index appear primarily to reflect tectonic patterns and transient adjustment to those patterns by channel networks. climate and lithology do not appear to exert first-order controls on patterns of basin-averaged erosion rates in the bolivian andes. copyright © 2005 john wiley & sons, ltd.

self-reported health-related quality-of-life issues for aboriginal and torres strait islander patients with experience of cancer in australia: a review of literature vulvar cancer is a serious condition that requires a range of specialist treatments including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. in australia, such treatments are only available in major metropolitan hospitals. thus, women diagnosed with this condition in rural and remote areas must relocate to the metropolitan specialist centers for treatment. the focus of this article is on the experience of relocation for specialist care for indigenous women diagnosed with vulvar cancer from east arnhem land, northern territory, australia. the findings presented in this article explore a range of issues that affect the experience of relocation such as community concerns, cultural distress, loneliness, fear, worry, and physical concerns associated with the condition.
psoriasis in a nationwide cohort study of patients with celiac disease. objectives to find out whether patients with psoriatic arthritis (psoa) have an increased prevalence of antibodies to gliadin (aga) and of coeliac disease.   methods one hundred and fourteen psoa patients with skin disease of 20+/-13 yr and joint disease of 11+/-10 yr duration answered a questionnaire concerning their medical history and underwent clinical examination, including radiology. serum iga aga and igg aga, iga antibodies to endomysium and immunoglobulins, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr) and c-reactive protein (crp) concentration were determined.   results five of the 114 patients (4.4%) had coeliac disease. after exclusion of these five patients, the mean iga aga concentration was significantly higher (p=0.0005) than that in a reference group. none of the patients had iga antibodies to endomysium. the mean serum iga concentration was significantly increased and igm decreased. patients with a high concentration of iga aga had significantly higher esr and crp and a longer duration of morning stiffness than those with a low aga concentration.   conclusions patients with psoa have an increased prevalence of raised serum iga aga and of coeliac disease. patients with raised iga aga seem to have more pronounced inflammation than those with a low iga aga concentration.
angiotensin stimulates tgf-beta1 and clusterin in the hydronephrotic neonatal rat kidney. chronic unilateral ureteral obstruction (uuo) in early development activates the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system and leads to profound renal vasoconstriction, renal growth arrest, and interstitial fibrosis. to investigate the response of the at1 and at2 subtypes of the angiotensin ii (ang ii) receptors to uuo, sprague-dawley rats underwent uuo or control sham operation in the first 48 h of life and were studied 1-28 days later. renal mrna for renin, at1 and at2 receptor, and receptor binding and distribution were determined. in contrast to controls, renin mrna increased from 14 to 28 days in the obstructed kidney. after ipsilateral uuo, at1 mrna was suppressed at 1 day, but had increased compared with controls at 28 days. at2 receptor mrna fell rapidly in all kidneys from 1 to 3 days of age, after which it remained undetectable. compared with the intact opposite kidney, at2 mrna was suppressed in the obstructed kidney 1 day after uuo. compared with controls, at1 and at2 receptor binding was decreased by ipsilateral uuo at 1 day, whereas at1 binding was increased at 28 days. renal ang ii content was increased in the obstructed compared with the intact opposite kidney 28 days after uuo. in view of the increase in renal renin and angiotensin ii production resulting from uuo, increased renal at1 mrna and receptor binding are likely to contribute to the vasoconstriction and interstitial fibrosis of the neonatal kidney after prolonged uuo.
drought in forest understory ecosystems - a novel rainfall reduction experiment increasing greenhouse gas concentrations are expected to enhance the interannual variability of summer climate in europe and other mid-latitude regions, potentially causing more frequent heatwaves. climate models consistently predict an increase in the variability of summer temperatures in these areas, but the underlying mechanisms responsible for this increase remain uncertain. here we explore these mechanisms using regional simulations of recent and future climatic conditions with and without land–atmosphere interactions. our results indicate that the increase in summer temperature variability predicted in central and eastern europe is mainly due to feedbacks between the land surface and the atmosphere. furthermore, they suggest that land–atmosphere interactions increase climate variability in this region because climatic regimes in europe shift northwards in response to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, creating a new transitional climate zone with strong land–atmosphere coupling in central and eastern europe. these findings emphasize the importance of soil-moisture–temperature feedbacks (in addition to soil-moisture–precipitation feedbacks) in influencing summer climate variability and the potential migration of climate zones with strong land–atmosphere coupling as a consequence of global warming. this highlights the crucial role of land–atmosphere interactions in future climate change.
association of the breast cancer antiestrogen resistance protein 1 (bcar1) and bcar3 scaffolding proteins in cell signaling and antiestrogen resistance* the adapter molecule p130cas (cas) plays a role in cellular processes such as proliferation, survival, cell adhesion, and migration. the ability of cas to promote migration has been shown to be dependent upon its carboxyl terminus, which contains a bipartite binding site for the protein tyrosine kinase c-src (src). the association between src and cas enhances src kinase activity, and like cas, src plays an important role in cell proliferation and migration. in this study, we show that src and cas function cooperatively to promote cell migration in a manner that depends upon kinase-active src. another carboxyl-terminal binding partner of cas, and-34/bcar3 (and-34), functions synergistically with cas to enhance src activation and cell migration. the carboxyl-terminal guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain of and-34, as well as the activity of its putative target rap1, contribute to these events. a mechanism through which and-34 may regulate cas-dependent cell migration is suggested by the finding that cas becomes redistributed from focal adhesions to lamellipodia located at the leading edge of and-34 overexpressing cells. these data thus provide insight into how cas and and-34 may function together to stimulate src signaling pathways and promote cell migration.
the claudin‐16 channel gene is transcriptionally inhibited by 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin d the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (casr) plays a major role in the maintenance of a physiological serum ionized calcium (ca2+) concentration by regulating the circulating levels of parathyroid hormone. it was molecularly identified in 1993 by brown et al. in the laboratory of dr. steven hebert with an expression cloning strategy. subsequent studies have demonstrated that the casr is highly expressed in the kidney, where it is capable of integrating signals deriving from the tubular fluid and/or the interstitial plasma. additional studies elucidating inherited and acquired mutations in the casr gene, the existence of activating and inactivating autoantibodies, and genetic polymorphisms of the casr have greatly enhanced our understanding of the role of the casr in mineral ion metabolism. allosteric modulators of the casr are the first drugs in their class to become available for clinical use and have been shown to treat successfully hyperparathyroidism secondary to advanced renal failure. in addition, preclinical and clinical studies suggest the possibility of using such compounds in various forms of hypercalcemic hyperparathyroidism, such as primary and lithium-induced hyperparathyroidism and that occurring after renal transplantation. this review addresses the role of the casr in kidney physiology and pathophysiology as well as current and in-the-pipeline treatments utilizing casr-based therapeutics.
salvage brachytherapy in prostate local recurrence after radiation therapy: predicting factors for control and toxicity purpose we describe the treatment outcome in 17 patients who received combined salvage brachytherapy and short-term androgen deprivation therapy for local prostate cancer relapse after prior external beam irradiation.   materials and methods median patient age was 68 years. local relapse after external beam irradiation was confirmed by biopsy. median prostate specific antigen at local relapse was 4.7 ng/ml. five of the 17 patients were enrolled in a protocol combining androgen deprivation therapy with brachytherapy and the remaining men were treated off protocol. all patients received neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy for a median of 3 months, followed by ultrasound guided brachytherapy using 125i in 9 and 103pd seeds in 8. five patients also received adjuvant leuprolide for a median of 6 months. biochemical failure was defined using the american society for therapeutic radiology and oncology definition. toxicity was graded with a modified radiation therapy oncology group scale.   results median followup was 44 months. the actuarial 4-year biochemical control rate was 75%. three patients died of intercurrent diseases. no prostate cancer mortality or local failure had occurred at last followup. one patient had bone metastasis. no clinical or treatment factor was associated with biochemical control. grade 3 and 4 genitourinary toxicity developed in 7 (41%) and 1 patients (6%), respectively. grade 2 and 3 gastrointestinal toxicity occurred in 5 (29%) and 1 patients (6%), respectively.   conclusions our series suggests that salvage brachytherapy and short-term androgen deprivation therapy can achieve biochemical control in select patients with local relapse after prior external beam irradiation. the major side effects are urinary complications, including grade 3 and 4 complications in 41% and 6% of cases, respectively.
global stability analysis of competitive neural networks with mixed time-varying delays and discontinuous neuron activations this paper introduces a general class of neural networks with arbitrary constant delays in the neuron interconnections, and neuron activations belonging to the set of discontinuous monotone increasing and (possibly) unbounded functions. the discontinuities in the activations are an ideal model of the situation where the gain of the neuron amplifiers is very high and tends to infinity, while the delay accounts for the finite switching speed of the neuron amplifiers, or the finite signal propagation speed. it is known that the delay in combination with high-gain nonlinearities is a particularly harmful source of potential instability. the goal of this paper is to single out a subclass of the considered discontinuous neural networks for which stability is instead insensitive to the presence of a delay. more precisely, conditions are given under which there is a unique equilibrium point of the neural network, which is globally exponentially stable for the states, with a known convergence rate. the conditions are easily testable and independent of the delay. moreover, global convergence in finite time of the state and output is investigated. in doing so, new interesting dynamical phenomena are highlighted with respect to the case without delay, which make the study of convergence in finite time significantly more difficult. the obtained results extend previous work on global stability of delayed neural networks with lipschitz continuous neuron activations, and neural networks with discontinuous neuron activations but without delays.
laparoscopic stripping of endometriomas: a randomized trial on different surgical techniques. part i: clinical results. the management of large endometriomas was described in a series of 814 patients. combined therapy using gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (gnrha) and carbon dioxide laser laparoscopy was proposed. drainage and gnrha for 12 weeks provoked a reduction of the endometrioma size up to 50% of the initial value. after vaporization of the internal wall, a cumulative pregnancy of 51% after 1 year was achieved. a recurrence rate of 8% was observed for a follow-up of 2-11 years. histological data demonstrated that the epithelium covering the ovary which is the mesothelium can invaginate in the ovarian cortex. some of the invaginations were seen to be continuous with endometrial tissue, strongly suggesting the metaplasia theory in the pathogenesis of ovarian endometrioma.
neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus are selective for diverse and complex visual features here we ask whether visual response pattern varies with position in the cortical microcircuit by comparing the structure of receptive fields recorded from the different layers of the cat's primary visual cortex. we used whole-cell recording in vivo to show the spatial distribution of visually evoked excitatory and inhibitory inputs and to stain individual neurons. we quantified the distribution of 'on' and 'off' responses and the presence of spatially opponent excitation and inhibition within the receptive field. the thalamorecipient layers (4 and upper 6) were dominated by simple cells, as defined by two criteria: they had separated on and off subregions, and they had push-pull responses (in a given subregion, stimuli of the opposite contrast evoked responses of the opposite sign). other types of response profile correlated with laminar location as well. thus, connections unique to each visual cortical layer are likely to serve distinct functions.
the effect of prmt1-mediated arginine methylation on the subcellular localization, stress granules, and detergent-insoluble aggregates of fus/tls mutations in fused in sarcoma (fus) are a cause of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fals). patients carrying point mutations in the c‐terminus of fus show neuronal cytoplasmic fus‐positive inclusions, whereas in healthy controls, fus is predominantly nuclear. cytoplasmic fus inclusions have also been identified in a subset of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (ftld‐fus). we show that a non‐classical py nuclear localization signal (nls) in the c‐terminus of fus is necessary for nuclear import. the majority of fals‐associated mutations occur within the nls and impair nuclear import to a degree that correlates with the age of disease onset. this presents the first case of disease‐causing mutations within a py‐nls. nuclear import of fus is dependent on transportin, and interference with this transport pathway leads to cytoplasmic redistribution and recruitment of fus into stress granules. moreover, proteins known to be stress granule markers co‐deposit with inclusions in fals and ftld‐fus patients, implicating stress granule formation in the pathogenesis of these diseases. we propose that two pathological hits, namely nuclear import defects and cellular stress, are involved in the pathogenesis of fus‐opathies.
equipment-as-experience: a heidegger-based position of information security while there is a rich body of literature on user acceptance of technologies with positive outcomes, little is known about user behavior toward what we call protective technologies: information technologies that protect data and systems from disturbances such as viruses, unauthorized access, disruptions, spyware, and others. in this paper, we present the results of a study of user behavioral intention toward protective technologies based on the framework of the theory of planned behavior. we find that awareness of the threats posed by negative technologies is a strong predictor of user behavioral intention toward the use of protective technologies. more interestingly, in the presence of awareness, the influence of subjective norm on individual behavioral intention is weaker among basic technology users but stronger among advanced technology users. furthermore, while our results are consistent with many of the previously established relationships in the context of positive technologies, we find that the determinants “perceived ease of use” and “computer self-efficacy” are no longer significant in the context of protective technologies. we believe that this result highlights the most significant difference between positive technologies and protective technologies: while the former are used for their designed utilities, for which usefulness and ease of use have a significant impact, the latter are used out of fear of negative consequences, for which awareness becomes a key determinant. we discussed the theoretical and practical implications of these findings. the findings of this study extend the theory of planned behavior to the context of protective technologies and shed insights on designing effective information security policies, practices, and protective technologies for organizations and society.
tumor necrosis factor alpha stimulates p62 accumulation and enhances proteasome activity independently of ros microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (lc3) is now widely used to monitor autophagy. one approach is to detect lc3 conversion (lc3-i to lc3-ii) by immunoblot analysis because the amount of lc3-ii is clearly correlated with the number of autophagosomes. however, lc3-ii itself is degraded by autophagy, making interpretation of the results of lc3 immunoblotting problematic. furthermore, the amount of lc3 at a certain time point does not indicate autophagic flux, and therefore, it is important to measure the amount of lc3-ii delivered to lysosomes by comparing lc3-ii levels in the presence and absence of lysosomal protease inhibitors. another problem with this method is that lc3-ii tends to be much more sensitive to be detected by immunoblotting than lc3-i. accordingly, simple comparison of lc3-i and lc3-ii, or summation of lc3-i and lc3-ii for ratio determinations, may not be appropriate, and rather, the amount of lc3-ii can be compared between samples.
sequence and organization of the neodiprion lecontei nucleopolyhedrovirus genome the genome of the lymantria dispar multinucleocapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (ldmnpv) was sequenced and analyzed. it is composed of 161,046 bases with a g + c content of 57.5% and contains 163 putative open reading frames (orfs) of >/=150 nucleotides. homologs were found to 95 of the 155 genes predicted for the autographa californica mnpv (acmnpv) genome. more than 9% of the ldmnpv genome was occupied by 16 repeated genes related to acmnpv orf2. readily identifiable homologs of several genes that have been reported to play important roles in the acmnpv life cycle are not present; these include ie-2, a transcriptional transactivator, and gp64, a major envelope glycoprotein of the nonoccluded form of the virus. a number of genes lacking in acmnpv but present in other baculoviruses were identified; these include two viral enhancing factor homologs, a second copy of a conotoxin-like gene, and a dutpase homolog. although a single gene predicted to encode a large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase was found, two different copies of the small subunit gene were present. in addition, homologs of genes not previously reported for baculoviruses were identified, including a predicted protein with homology to dna ligases and another that has motifs most closely related to a yeast mitochondrial helicase. thirteen homologous regions (hrs) containing 54 repeated sequences that include 30-bp imperfect palindromes were identified. the imperfect palindromes are related to those from other baculoviruses.
distinct muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes contribute to stability and growth, but not compensatory plasticity, of neuromuscular synapses terminal schwann cells overlying the neuromuscular junction sprout elaborate processes upon muscle denervation. we show here that motor axons use these processes as guides/substrates during regeneration; in so doing, they escape the confines of endplates and grow between endplates to generate polyneuronal innervation. we also show that schwann cells in the nerve provide similar guidance. axons extend from the cut end of a nerve in association with schwann cell processes and appear to navigate along them. the processes extend from axotomized nerves at the same rate and in the same manner as they do from axon-containing nerves. the rate of process extension limits the rate at which axons regenerate. thus, schwann cell processes lead and guide peripheral regeneration.
coexistence of multiple genotypes of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus with novel mutant s genes in the hubei province of china in 2016 abstract receptor recognition by viruses is the first and essential step of viral infections of host cells. it is an important determinant of viral host range and cross-species infection and a primary target for antiviral intervention. coronaviruses recognize a variety of host receptors, infect many hosts, and are health threats to humans and animals. the receptor-binding s1 subunit of coronavirus spike proteins contains two distinctive domains, the n-terminal domain (s1-ntd) and the c-terminal domain (s1-ctd), both of which can function as receptor-binding domains (rbds). s1-ntds and s1-ctds from three major coronavirus genera recognize at least four protein receptors and three sugar receptors and demonstrate a complex receptor recognition pattern. for example, highly similar coronavirus s1-ctds within the same genus can recognize different receptors, whereas very different coronavirus s1-ctds from different genera can recognize the same receptor. moreover, coronavirus s1-ntds can recognize either protein or sugar receptors. structural studies in the past decade have elucidated many of the puzzles associated with coronavirus-receptor interactions. this article reviews the latest knowledge on the receptor recognition mechanisms of coronaviruses and discusses how coronaviruses have evolved their complex receptor recognition pattern. it also summarizes important principles that govern receptor recognition by viruses in general.
distinct leaf‐trait syndromes of evergreen and deciduous trees in a seasonally dry tropical forest abstract independent contrasts are widely used to incorporate phylogenetic information into studies of continuous traits, particularly analyses of evolutionary trait correlations, but the effects of taxon sampling on these analyses have received little attention. in this paper, simulations were used to investigate the effects of taxon sampling patterns and alternative branch length assignments on the statistical performance of correlation coefficients and sign tests; “full‐tree” analyses based on contrasts at all nodes and “paired‐comparisons” based only on contrasts of terminal taxon pairs were also compared. the simulations showed that random samples, with respect to the traits under consideration, provide statistically robust estimates of trait correlations. however, exact significance tests are highly dependent on appropriate branch length information; equal branch lengths maintain lower type i error than alternative topological approaches, and adjusted critical values of the independent contrast correlation coefficient are provided for use with equal branch lengths. nonrandom samples, with respect to univariate or bivariate trait distributions, introduce discrepancies between interspecific and phylogenetically structured analyses and bias estimates of underlying evolutionary correlations. examples of nonrandom sampling processes may include community assembly processes, convergent evolution under local adaptive pressures, selection of a nonrandom sample of species from a habitat or life‐history group, or investigator bias. correlation analyses based on species pairs comparisons, while ignoring deeper relationships, entail significant loss of statistical power and as a result provide a conservative test of trait associations. paired comparisons in which species differ by a large amount in one trait, a method introduced in comparative plant ecology, have appropriate type i error rates and high statistical power, but do not correctly estimate the magnitude of trait correlations. sign tests, based on full‐tree or paired‐comparison approaches, are highly reliable across a wide range of sampling scenarios, in terms of type i error rates, but have very low power. these results provide guidance for selecting species and applying comparative methods to optimize the performance of statistical tests of trait associations.
geodesic diameter of sets defined by few quadratic equations and inequalities abstract in this paper we consider the problem of bounding the betti numbers, bi(s), of a semi-algebraic set s⊂ℝk defined by polynomial inequalities p1≥0,…,ps≥0, where pi∈ℝ[x1,…,xk], s<k, and deg (pi)≤2, for 1≤i≤s. we prove that for 0≤i≤k−1, $$\begin{array}{lll}\displaystyle b_{i}(s)&\displaystyle \le&\displaystyle \frac{1}{2}+(k-s)+\frac{1}{2}\cdot \sum_{j=0}^{\mathit{min}\{s+1,k-i\}}2^{j}{{s+1}\choose j}{{k}\choose j-1}\\[18pt]&\displaystyle \le &\displaystyle \frac{3}{2}\cdot\biggl(\frac{6ek}{s}\biggr)^{s}+k.\end{array}$$ this improves the bound of ko(s) proved by barvinok (in math. z. 225:231–244, 1997). this improvement is made possible by a new approach, whereby we first bound the betti numbers of non-singular complete intersections of complex projective varieties defined by generic quadratic forms, and use this bound to obtain bounds in the real semi-algebraic case.
immunomodulatory effects of turmeric, curcuma longa (magnoliophyta, zingiberaceae) on macrobrachium rosenbergii (crustacea, palaemonidae) against vibrio alginolyticus (proteobacteria, vibrionaceae). curcumin is a polyphenol derived from the dietary spice turmeric. it has been shown to regulate numerous transcription factors, cytokines, adhesion molecules, and enzymes that have been linked to inflammation. in addition to inhibiting the growth of a variety of pathogens, curcumin has been shown to have nematocidal activity. the present study was designed to evaluate the schistosomicidal activity of curcumin in vivo as well as immunomodulation of granulomatous inflammation and liver pathology in acute schistosomiasis mansoni. mice were infected each with 80 schistosoma (s.) mansoni cercariae and injected intraperitoneally with curcumin at a total dose of 400mg/kg body weight. curcumin was effective in reducing worm and tissue-egg burdens, hepatic granuloma volume and liver collagen content by 44.4%, 30.9%, 79%, and 38.6%, respectively. curcumin treatment restored hepatic enzymes activities to the normal levels and enhanced catalase activity in the liver tissue of infected mice. moreover, hepato-spleenomegaly and eosinophilia induced by s. mansoni infection were largely improved with curcumin treatment. infected mice treated with curcumin showed low serum level of both interleukin (il)-12 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), but il-10 level was not significantly altered. specific igg and igg1 responses against both soluble worm antigen (swap) and soluble egg antigen (sea) were augmented with curcumin treatment, but igm and igg2a responses were not significantly changed. in conclusion, curcumin treatment modulates cellular and humoral immune responses of infected mice and lead to a significant reduction of parasite burden and liver pathology in acute murine schistosomiasis mansoni.
noradrenergic content and turnover rate in kidney and heart shows gender and strain differences. a method of measuring the rate of synthesis of catecholamines in various tissues takes advantage of the steady state relationship in which the rate of catecholamine formation is equal to the rate of efflux. after tyrosine hydroxylase is blocked with α-methyltyrosine, the brain levels of norepinephrine (ne) and dopamine and the ne levels in various peripheral tissues of rats and rabbits decline exponentially. the rate of synthesis of the catecholamines is calculated from the product of the rate constant of amine decline and the normal catecholamine level. the value for heart ne yielded by this method is almost identical with that obtained from the decline in radioactivity after labeling with dl -h3-ne. the application of this method to studies in the rat shows that the turnover time for ne in heart, salivary gland and iris is about 12 hr, compared to 6 hr for brain ne, 3 hr for brain dopamine and 2 hr for ne in the cervical sympathetic ganglia. in the rabbit hypothalamus, ne is formed five times more rapidly than in the midbrain, though the turnover times are almost identical. this suggests that the rate of synthesis might be similar in each adrenergic unit and that variations in rates of synthesis in different brain areas are a function of the number of neurons per gram of tissue.
the development and validation of a fast and robust dried blood spot based lipid profiling method to study infant metabolism dyslipidemia is an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes, although exactly which of the many plasma lipids contribute to this remains unclear. we therefore investigated whether lipid profiling can inform diabetes prediction by performing liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-based lipid profiling in 189 individuals who developed type 2 diabetes and 189 matched disease-free individuals, with over 12 years of follow up in the framingham heart study. we found that lipids of lower carbon number and double bond content were associated with an increased risk of diabetes, whereas lipids of higher carbon number and double bond content were associated with decreased risk. this pattern was strongest for triacylglycerols (tags) and persisted after multivariable adjustment for age, sex, bmi, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, total triglycerides, and hdl cholesterol. a combination of 2 tags further improved diabetes prediction. to explore potential mechanisms that modulate the distribution of plasma lipids, we performed lipid profiling during oral glucose tolerance testing, pharmacologic interventions, and acute exercise testing. levels of tags associated with increased risk for diabetes decreased in response to insulin action and were elevated in the setting of insulin resistance. conversely, levels of tags associated with decreased diabetes risk rose in response to insulin and were poorly correlated with insulin resistance. these studies identify a relationship between lipid acyl chain content and diabetes risk and demonstrate how lipid profiling could aid in clinical risk assessment.
coral-associated bacterial assemblages: current knowledge and the potential for climate-driven impacts. abstract we investigated which microbial taxa in coastal red sea water were stimulated by addition of mucus from the coral fungia sp. decreases in the concentration and c/n ratio of particulate organic material during short-term incubations (50 h) were paralleled by a steep rise in the number of gammaproteobacteria, particularly alteromonadaceae, followed by vibrionaceae. two almost identical genotypes affiliated with alteromonas macleodii accounted for up to >85% of all alteromonadaceae (45% of the total cells) in the mucus-amended enrichments but were rare in unamended control incubations and in ambient seawater. a. macleodii-like bacteria might thus be important in the transfer of organic carbon from coral mucus to the pelagic microbial food webs of coral reefs.
population coding and decoding in a neural field: a computational study coarse codes are widely used throughout the brain to encode sensory and motor variables. methods designed to interpret these codes, such as population vector analysis, are either inefficient, i.e., the variance of the estimate is much larger than the smallest possible variance, or biologically implausible, like maximum likelihood. moreover, these methods attempt to compute a scalar or vector estimate of the encoded variable. neurons are faced with a similar estimation problem. they must read out the responses of the presynaptic neurons, but, by contrast, they typically encode the variable with a further population code rather than as a scalar. we show how a non-linear recurrent network can be used to perform these estimation in an optimal way while keeping the estimate in a coarse code format. this work suggests that lateral connections in the cortex may be involved in cleaning up uncorrelated noise among neurons representing similar variables.
clicking for calamari: toothed whales can echolocate squid loligo pealeii summary toothed whales (odontoceti, cetacea) navigate and locate prey by means of active echolocation. studies on captive animals have accumulated a large body of knowledge concerning the production, reception and processing of sound in odontocete biosonars, but there is little information about the properties and use of biosonar clicks of free-ranging animals in offshore habitats. this study presents the first source parameter estimates of biosonar clicks from two free-ranging oceanic delphinids, the opportunistically foraging pseudorca crassidens and the cephalopod eating grampus griseus. pseudorca produces short duration (30 μs), broadband (q=2–3) signals with peak frequencies around 40 khz, centroid frequencies of 30–70 khz, and source levels between 201–225 db re. 1 μpa (peak to peak, pp). grampus also produces short (40 μs), broadband (q=2–3) signals with peak frequencies around 50 khz, centroid frequencies of 60–90 khz, and source levels between 202 and 222 db re. 1 μpa (pp). on-axis clicks from both species had centroid frequencies in the frequency range of most sensitive hearing, and lower peak frequencies and higher source levels than reported from captive animals. it is demonstrated that sound production in these two free-ranging echolocators is dynamic, and that free-ranging animals may not always employ biosonar signals comparable to the extreme signal properties reported from captive animals in long-range detection tasks. similarities in source parameters suggest that evolutionary factors other than prey type determine the properties of biosonar signals of the two species. modelling shows that interspecific detection ranges of prey types differ from 80 to 300 m for grampus and pseudorca, respectively.
cuneate and spinal trigeminal nucleus projections to the cochlear nucleus are differentially associated with vesicular glutamate transporter-2 the cochlear nucleus (cn) is the first auditory structure to receive binaural information via cn-commissural connections. in spite of an abundance of evidence that cn-commissural neurons are glycinergic and thus inhibitory, physiological, and anatomical evidence suggests that a small group of cn-commissural neurons are excitatory. in this study, we examined the excitatory portion of the cn-commissural pathway by combining anterograde tract tracing with immunohistochemistry of vesicular glutamate transporters (vgluts) and retrograde tract tracing with immunohistochemistry of glycine and gaba. vgluts accumulate glutamate in synaptic vesicles and are prime markers for glutamatergic neurons. the terminal endings of cn-commissural projections were typically en passant or small terminal boutons, but large, irregular swellings were also observed, confined to the granule cell domain (gcd). both small and large terminal endings in the gcd colabeled with vglut2, but not vglut1. in addition, some cn-commissural cells themselves received vglut2-positive puncta on their somata. after large injections into the cn, 37% of the total number of retrogradely labeled commissural neurons was immunonegative to glycine or gaba. retrograde labeling after a restricted gcd injection revealed a majority of putative excitatory cn-commissural neurons as multipolar, in the marginal regions of the ventral cn, medially as well as in the small cell cap region and deep dorsal cn. these results provide direct anatomical evidence that an excitatory commissural projection is present, and vglut2 is associated with this pathway both as its source and as a recipient.
will remote sensing shape the next generation of species distribution models one of the key advantages of a low-flying unmanned aircraft system uas is its ability to acquire digital images at an ultrahigh spatial resolution of a few centimeters. remote sensing of quantitative biochemical and biophysical characteristics of small-sized spatially fragmented vegetation canopies requires, however, not only high spatial, but also high spectral i.e., hyperspectral resolution. in this paper, we describe the design, development, airborne operations, calibration, processing, and interpretation of image data collected with a new hyperspectral unmanned aircraft system hyperuas. hyperuas is a remotely controlled multirotor prototype carrying onboard a lightweight pushbroom spectroradiometer coupled with a dual frequency gps and an inertial movement unit. the prototype was built to remotely acquire imaging spectroscopy data of 324 spectral bands 162 bands in a spectrally binned mode with bandwidths between 4 and 5i¾?nm at an ultrahigh spatial resolution of 2-5i¾?cm. three field airborne experiments, conducted over agricultural crops and over natural ecosystems of antarctic mosses, proved operability of the system in standard field conditions, but also in a remote and harsh, low-temperature environment of east antarctica. experimental results demonstrate that hyperuas is capable of delivering georeferenced maps of quantitative biochemical and biophysical variables of vegetation and of actual vegetation health state at an unprecedented spatial resolution of 5i¾?cm.

analysis of intra-institutional research collaboration: a case of a serbian faculty of sciences a network is said to show assortative mixing if the nodes in the network that have many connections tend to be connected to other nodes with many connections. here we measure mixing patterns in a variety of networks and find that social networks are mostly assortatively mixed, but that technological and biological networks tend to be disassortative. we propose a model of an assortatively mixed network, which we study both analytically and numerically. within this model we find that networks percolate more easily if they are assortative and that they are also more robust to vertex removal.
towards a framework of digital platform competition: a comparative study of monopolistic & federated mobile payment platforms i this essay, we argue that pervasive digitization gives birth to a new type of product architecture: the layered modular architecture. the layered modular architecture extends the modular architecture of physical products by incorporating four loosely coupled layers of devices, networks, services, and contents created by digital technology. we posit that this new architecture instigates profound changes in the ways that firms organize for innovation in the future. we develop (1) a conceptual framework to describe the emerging organizing logic of digital innovation and (2) an information systems research agenda for digital strategy and the creation and management of corporate information technology infrastructures.
male-specific molecular genetic markers in the japanese subterranean termite reticulitermes speratus it is difficult to identify sex in many species of eukaryotic organism. this can considerably impede research into their biology. fortunately, one sex often possesses a unique chromosome termed y or w. when dna markers are available for these chromosomes, then sex identification becomes straightforward. we describe a technique that facilitates the isolation of such markers. the procedure makes use of low-stringency pcr to screen randomly selected primers for their ability to amplify sex-specific loci.
enhancing effect of cerebral blood volume by mild exercise in healthy young men: a near-infrared spectroscopy study this review article includes a systematic evaluation of the empirical data concerning deficits in mental ability, brain perfusion, and cerebral functioning due to chronically low blood pressure. a number of studies have provided strong evidence for reduced cognitive performance in hypotension, particularly in the domains of attention and memory. eeg studies have demonstrated that the hypotension-related poorer mental ability is also reflected in diminished cortical activity. contrary to convention, more recent research has suggested a deficient regulation of cerebral blood flow in persons with low blood pressure. in addition to reduced tonic brain perfusion, studies demonstrated insufficient adjustment of blood flow to cognitive requirements. altogether, these findings suggest that more attention should be allocated to chronic hypotension in both research and clinical practice.
multiple infection sources identification with provable guarantees assume a network (v,e) where a subset of the nodes in v are active. we consider the problem of selecting a set of k active nodes that best explain the observed activation state, under a given information-propagation model. we call these nodes effectors. we formally define the k-effectors problem and study its complexity for different types of graphs. we show that for arbitrary graphs the problem is not only np-hard to solve optimally, but also np-hard to approximate. we also show that, for some special cases, the problem can be solved optimally in polynomial time using a dynamic-programming algorithm. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to consider the k-effectors problem in networks. we experimentally evaluate our algorithms using the dblp co-authorship graph, where we search for effectors of topics that appear in research papers.
tradeoffs between the axial resolution and the signal-to-noise ratio in elastography this paper presents a theoretical framework for performance characterization in strain estimation, which includes the effect of signal decorrelation, quantization errors due to the finite temporal sampling rate, and electronic noise. an upper bound on the performance of the strain estimator in elastography is obtained from a strain filter constructed using these limits. the strain filter is a term used to describe the nonlinear filtering process in the strain domain (due to the ultrasound system and signal processing parameters) that allows the elastographic depiction of a limited range of strains from the compressed tissue. the strain filter predicts the elastogram quality by specifying the elastographic signal-to-noise ratio (snr/sub e/), sensitivity, and the strain dynamic range at a given resolution. the dynamic range is limited by decorrelation errors for large tissue strain values, and electronic noise for low strain values. tradeoffs between different techniques used to enhance elastogram image quality may also be analyzed using the strain filter.
hmga proteins promote atm expression and enhance cancer cell resistance to genotoxic agents the high mobility group hmga1 protein belongs to a family of architectural factors that play a role in chromosomal organisation and gene transcription regulation. hmga1 overexpression represents a common feature of human malignant tumours and is causally associated with neoplastic transformation and metastatic progression. recently, hmga1 expression has been correlated with the presence of chromosomal rearrangements and suggested to promote genomic instability. here, we report a novel interaction between hmga1 protein and the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (atm) kinase, the major key player in the cellular response to dna damage caused by several agents such as ionising radiation (ir). we identified an sq motif on hmga1, which is effectively phosphorylated by atm in vitro and in vivo. interestingly, confocal microscopy revealed that hmga1 colocalises with the activated form of atm (atm s1981p). moreover, hmga1 ectopic expression decreases cell survival following exposure to ir as assessed by clonogenic survival in mcf-7 cells, further supporting the hypothesis that hmga1 might act as a downstream target of the atm pathway in response to dna damage.
sources of seasonal fractional integration in macroeconomic time series a simple construction that will be referred to as an error-duration model is shown to generate fractional integration and long memory. an error-duration representation also exists for many familiar arma models, making error duration an alternative to autoregression for explaining dynamic persistence in economic variables. the results lead to a straightforward procedure for simulating fractional integration and establish a connection between fractional integration and common notions of structural change. two examples show how the error-duration model could account for fractional integration in aggregate employment and in asset price volatility.
traffic-related air pollution and dementia incidence in northern sweden: a longitudinal study background traffic-related particles induce oxidative stress and may exert adverse effects on central nervous system function, which could manifest as cognitive impairment. objective we assessed the association between black carbon (bc), a marker of traffic-related air pollution, and cognition in older men. methods a total of 680 men (mean ± sd, 71 ± 7 years of age) from the u.s. department of veterans affairs normative aging study completed a battery of seven cognitive tests at least once between 1996 and 2007. we assessed long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution using a validated spatiotemporal land-use regression model for bc. results the association between bc and cognition was nonlinear, and we log-transformed bc estimates for all analyses [ln(bc)]. in a multivariable-adjusted model, for each doubling in bc on the natural scale, the odds of having a mini-mental state examination (mmse) score ≤ 25 was 1.3 times higher [95% confidence interval (ci), 1.1 to 1.6]. in a multivariable-adjusted model for global cognitive function, which combined scores from the remaining six tests, a doubling of bc was associated with a 0.054 sd lower test score (95% ci, −0.103 to −0.006), an effect size similar to that observed with a difference in age of 1.9 years in our data. we found no evidence of heterogeneity by cognitive test. in sensitivity analyses adjusting for past lead exposure, the association with mmse scores was similar (odds ratio = 1.3; 95% ci, 1.1 to 1.7), but the association with global cognition was somewhat attenuated (−0.038 per doubling in bc; 95% ci, −0.089 to 0.012). conclusions ambient traffic-related air pollution was associated with decreased cognitive function in older men.
plant essential oils synergize and antagonize toxicity of different conventional insecticides against myzus persicae (hemiptera: aphididae) in recent years, the use of essential oils (eos) derived from aromatic plants as low-risk insecticides has increased considerably owing to their popularity with organic growers and environmentally conscious consumers. eos are easily produced by steam distillation of plant material and contain many volatile, low-molecular-weight terpenes and phenolics. the major plant families from which eos are extracted include myrtaceae, lauraceae, lamiaceae, and asteraceae. eos have repellent, insecticidal, and growth-reducing effects on a variety of insects. they have been used effectively to control preharvest and postharvest phytophagous insects and as insect repellents for biting flies and for home and garden insects. the compounds exert their activities on insects through neurotoxic effects involving several mechanisms, notably through gaba, octopamine synapses, and the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. with a few exceptions, their mammalian toxicity is low and environmental persistence is short. registration has been the main bottleneck in putting new products on the market, but more eos have been approved for use in the united states than elsewhere owing to reduced-risk processes for these materials.
where to restore ecological connectivity? detecting barriers and quantifying restoration benefits the impact of the landscape matrix on patterns of animal movement and population dynamics has been widely recognized by ecologists. however, few tools are available to model the matrix’s influence on the length, relative quality, and redundancy of dispersal routes connecting habitat patches. many gis software packages can use land use/land cover maps to identify the route of least resistance between two points—the least-cost path. the limitation of this type of analysis is that only a single path is identified, even though alternative paths with comparable costs might exist. in this paper, we implemented two graph theory methods that extend the least-cost path approach: the conditional minimum transit cost (cmtc) tool and the multiple shortest paths (msps) tool. both methods enable the visualization of multiple dispersal routes that, together, are assumed to form a corridor. we show that corridors containing alternative dispersal routes emerge when favorable habitat is randomly distributed in space. as clusters of favorable habitat start forming, corridors become less redundant and dispersal bottlenecks become visible. our approach is illustrated using data from a real landscape in the brazilian atlantic forest. we explored the effect of small, localized disturbance on dispersal routes linking conservation units. simulated habitat destruction caused the appearance of alternative dispersal routes, or caused existing corridors to become narrower. these changes were observed even in the absence of significant differences in the length or cost of least-cost paths. last, we discuss applications to animal movement studies and conservation initiatives.
prevalence and severity of ocular surface neoplasia in african nations and need for early interventions objective to examine the reliability of clinical examination and in vivo confocal microscopy (ivcm) in distinguishing ocular surface squamous neoplasia (ossn) from benign conjunctival lesions. design case-control study. participants sixty individuals with conjunctival lesions (ossn and benign) and 60 age-matched controls with normal conjunctiva presenting to kilimanjaro christian medical centre, moshi, tanzania. methods participants were examined and photographed, and ivcm was performed. patients with conjunctival lesions were offered excisional biopsy with histopathology and a human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) test. the ivcm images were read masked to the clinical appearance and pathology results. images were graded for several specific features and given an overall categorization (normal, benign, or malignant). a group of 8 ophthalmologists were shown photographs of conjunctival lesions and asked to independently classify as ossn or benign. main outcome measures comparison of the histopathology diagnosis with the clinical and ivcm diagnosis. results fifty-two cases underwent excisional biopsy with histopathology; 34 were on the ossn spectrum, 17 were benign, and 1 was lymphoma. the cases and controls had comparable demographic profiles. human immunodeficiency syndrome infection was more common in ossn compared with benign cases (58.8% vs. 5.6%; odds ratio, 24.3, 95% confidence interval [ci], 2.8–204; p = 0.003). clinically, ossn lesions more frequently exhibited feeder vessels and tended to have more leukoplakia and a gelatinous appearance. overall, the ophthalmologists showed moderate agreement with the histology result (average kappa = 0.51; 95% ci, 0.36–0.64). the masked grading of ivcm images reliably distinguished normal conjunctiva. however, ivcm was unable to reliably distinguish between benign lesions and ossn because of an overlap in their appearance (kappa = 0.44; 95% ci, 0.32–0.57). no single feature was significantly more frequent in ossn compared with benign lesions. the sensitivity and specificity of ivcm for distinguishing ossn from benign conjunctival lesions were 38.5% and 66.7%, respectively. conclusions in east africa, conjunctival pathology is relatively common and can present significant diagnostic challenges for the clinician. in this study, neither clinical examination nor ivcm was found to reliably distinguish ossn from benign conjunctival pathology because of an overlap in the features of these groups. therefore, ivcm cannot currently replace histopathology, and management decisions should continue to rely on careful clinical assessment supported by histopathology as indicated.
emergence of cooperative long-term market loyalty in double auction markets self-tuning experience weighted attraction (ewa) is a one-parameter theory of learning in  games. it addresses a criticism that an earlier model (ewa) has too many parameters, by  fixing some parameters at plausible values and replacing others with functions of experience  so that they no longer need to be estimated. consequently, it is econometrically simpler  than the popular weighted fictitious play and reinforcement learning models.  the functions of experience which replace free parameters “self-tune” over time, adjusting  in a way that selects a sensible learning rule to capture subjects’ choice dynamics. for  instance, the self-tuning ewa model can turn from a weighted fictitious play into an averaging  reinforcement learning as subjects equilibrate and learn to ignore inferior foregone  payoffs. the theory was tested on seven different games, and compared to the earlier parametric  ewa model and a one-parameter stochastic equilibrium theory (qre). self-tuning  ewa does as well as ewa in predicting behavior in new games, even though it has fewer  parameters, and fits reliably better than the qre equilibrium benchmark.

neural and hydroxyl radical mechanisms underlying laryngeal airway hyperreactivity induced by laryngeal acid-pepsin insult in anesthetized rats. fifty two patients with abnormal acid gastro-oesophageal reflux were studied by simultaneous oesophageal ph monitoring and continuous aspiration for 16 hours. aspirates (from discrete two hour periods) were analysed for volume, ph, bile acids (conjugated and unconjugated), trypsin, and pepsin. the results were compared with ph changes and degree of oesophagitis. patients with oesophagitis had greater acid reflux than those without, but patients with stricture and barrett's oesophagus had similar acid reflux to those with uncomplicated erosive oesophagitis. pepsin concentrations were highest in patients with stricture and barrett's oesophagus particularly during nocturnal periods. conjugated bile acids were detected in 75% of patients, mainly during the night, but only 2% of aspirates contained concentrations likely to be cytotoxic. unconjugated bile acids were not detected, and trypsin was seldom found. reflux oesophagitis is caused by acid and pepsin. bile acids and trypsin are probably unimportant.
transcriptome sequencing and expression analysis of cadmium (cd) transport and detoxification related genes in cd-accumulating salix integra heavy metal (hm)-accumulating herbaceous and woody plants are employed for phytoremediation. to develop improved strategies for enhancing phytoremediation efficiency, knowledge of the microstructural, physiological and molecular responses underlying hm-accumulation is required. here we review the progress in understanding the structural, physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying hm uptake, transport, sequestration and detoxification, as well as the regulation of these processes by signal transduction in response to hm exposure. the significance of genetic engineering for enhancing phytoremediation efficiency is also discussed. in herbaceous plants, hms are taken up by roots and transported into the root cells via transmembrane carriers for nutritional ions. the hms absorbed by root cells can be further translocated to the xylem vessels and unloaded into the xylem sap, thereby reaching the aerial parts of plants. hms can be sequestered in the cell walls, vacuoles and the golgi apparatuses. plant roots initially perceive hm stress and trigger the signal transduction, thereby mediating changes at the molecular, physiological, and microstructural level. signaling molecules such as phytohormones, reactive oxygen species (ros) and nitric oxide (no), modulate plant responses to hms via differentially expressed genes, activation of the antioxidative system and coordinated cross talk among different signaling molecules. a number of genes participated in hm uptake, transport, sequestration and detoxification have been functionally characterized and transformed to target plants for enhancing phytoremediation efficiency. fast growing woody plants hold an advantage over herbaceous plants for phytoremediation in terms of accumulation of high hm-amounts in their large biomass. presumably, woody plants accumulate hms using similar mechanisms as herbaceous counterparts, but the processes of hm accumulation and signal transduction can be more complex in woody plants.
a population-average mri-based atlas collection of the rhesus macaque a three-dimensional multimodality computerized map of the nemestrina monkey brain was created with serial sectioning and digital imaging techniques. an adult female macaca nemestrina (pigtail macaque) weighing 7.2 kg was used in constructing this atlas. ct, pet, and mri were performed on the monkey before the specimen's head was frozen and cryoplaned. closely spaced (50 microns) images of the specimen blockface were then digitally acquired and modified to produce whole head and brain-only 3d image sets. the resulting data sets were organized into a digital volume and repositioned into a stereotaxic coordinate system defined by horsley and clark in 1908 [7]. orthogonal images were obtained by digitally resampling the volume in order to produce a full set of coronal, sagittal, and horizontal images. stereotaxic reference grids were applied to each image indicating the a/p, m/l, or ho position within the digital volume. specific anatomic structures were outlined from the cryosection data set and 3d surface models reconstructed. structural labels indicating nuclei, tracts, and other neuroanatomical features were incorporated into coronally sliced cryosection images spaced at 500 microns. the ct, pet, and mri data sets were reconstructed into a digital volume and coregistered to the cryosection volume. all images constructed from this 3d map are available for public access via the internet using an anonymous file transfer protocol (ftp) and the world wide web (http:@www.loni.ucla.edu). the foremost advantage of this digital map is an integrated multimodality three-dimensional representation of the macaca nemestrina brain, which is not possible with traditional atlases.
delivery of liposomes with different sizes to mice brain after sonication by focused ultrasound in the presence of microbubbles. antibody-based anticancer agents are promising chemotherapeutic agents. among these agents, herceptin (trastuzumab), a humanized anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2/c-erbb2) monoclonal antibody, has been used successfully in patients with breast cancer. however, in patients with brain metastasis, the blood-brain barrier limits its use, and a different delivery method is needed to treat these patients. here, we report that herceptin can be delivered locally and noninvasively into the mouse central nervous system through the blood-brain barrier under image guidance by using an mri-guided focused ultrasound blood-brain barrier disruption technique. the amount of herceptin delivered to the target tissue was correlated with the extent of the mri-monitored barrier opening, making it possible to estimate indirectly the amount of herceptin delivered. histological changes attributable to this procedure were minimal. this method may represent a powerful technique for the delivery of macromolecular agents such as antibodies to treat patients with diseases of the central nervous system.
the ability of cbcl dsm-oriented scales to predict dsm-iv diagnoses in a referred sample of children and adolescents department of psychology, bryn mawr college separately for ages 11/2 to 5 and 6 to 18, used items for rating behavioral and emotional problems to construct (a) "top-down" dsm-oriented scales from experts' ratings of the items' consistency with diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th ed. [dsm-iv], american psychiatric association, 1994) categories, and (b) "bottom-up" empirically based syndromes from factor analyses of parent, caregiver, teacher, and self ratings (n = 14,853). both kinds of scales are scored from the same assessment instruments and are displayed on profiles normed on the same national samples. psychometric properties were similar for both kinds of scales. associations between counterpart scales were medium to strong. quantified, normed dsm-oriented and empirically based scales scored from the same instruments can facilitate assessment of individuals, statistical analyses for research purposes, and integration of top-down and bottom-up approaches to deriving constructs for psychopathology.
face recognition using 2.5d shape information previous work has demonstrated that the image variation of many objects (human faces in particular) under variable lighting can be effectively modeled by low-dimensional linear spaces, even when there are multiple light sources and shadowing. basis images spanning this space are usually obtained in one of three ways: a large set of images of the object under different lighting conditions is acquired, and principal component analysis (pca) is used to estimate a subspace. alternatively, synthetic images are rendered from a 3d model (perhaps reconstructed from images) under point sources and, again, pca is used to estimate a subspace. finally, images rendered from a 3d model under diffuse lighting based on spherical harmonics are directly used as basis images. in this paper, we show how to arrange physical lighting so that the acquired images of each object can be directly used as the basis vectors of a low-dimensional linear space and that this subspace is close to those acquired by the other methods. more specifically, there exist configurations of k point light source directions, with k typically ranging from 5 to 9, such that, by taking k images of an object under these single sources, the resulting subspace is an effective representation for recognition under a wide range of lighting conditions. since the subspace is generated directly from real images, potentially complex and/or brittle intermediate steps such as 3d reconstruction can be completely avoided; nor is it necessary to acquire large numbers of training images or to physically construct complex diffuse (harmonic) light fields. we validate the use of subspaces constructed in this fashion within the context of face recognition.

range size estimates of bolivian endemic bird species revisited: the importance of environmental data and national expert knowledge conservationists are increasingly relying on distribution models to predict where species are likely to occur, especially in poorly-surveyed but biodiverse areas. modeling is challenging in these cases because locality data necessary for model formation are often scarce and spatially imprecise. to identify methods best suited to modeling in these conditions, we compared the success of three algorithms (maxent, mahalanobis typicalities and random forests) at predicting distributions of eight bird and eight mammal species endemic to the eastern slopes of the central andes. we selected study species to have a range of locality sample sizes representative of the data available for endemic species of this region and also that vary in their distribution characteristics. we found that for species that are known from moderate numbers (n = 38–94) of localities, the three methods performed similarly for species with restricted distributions but maxent and random forests yielded better results for species with wider distributions. for species with small numbers of sample localities (n = 5–21), maxent produced the most consistently successful results, followed by random forests and then mahalanobis typicalities. because evaluation statistics for models derived from few localities can be suspect due to the poor spatial representation of the evaluation data, we corroborated these results with review by scientists familiar with the species in the field. overall, maxent appears to be the most capable method for modeling distributions of andean bird and mammal species because of the consistency of results in varying conditions, although the other methods have strengths in certain situations.
health state descriptions, valuations and individuals’ capacity to walk: a comparative evaluation of preference-based instruments in the context of spinal cord injury purposethis article introduces the new 5-level eq-5d (eq-5d-5l) health status measure.methodseq-5d currently measures health using three levels of severity in five dimensions. a euroqol group task force was established to find ways of improving the instrument’s sensitivity and reducing ceiling effects by increasing the number of severity levels. the study was performed in the united kingdom and spain. severity labels for 5 levels in each dimension were identified using response scaling. focus groups were used to investigate the face and content validity of the new versions, including hypothetical health states generated from those versions.resultsselecting labels at approximately the 25th, 50th, and 75th centiles produced two alternative 5-level versions. focus group work showed a slight preference for the wording ‘slight-moderate-severe’ problems, with anchors of ‘no problems’ and ‘unable to do’ in the eq-5d functional dimensions. similar wording was used in the pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression dimensions. hypothetical health states were well understood though participants stressed the need for the internal coherence of health states.conclusionsa 5-level version of the eq-5d has been developed by the euroqol group. further testing is required to determine whether the new version improves sensitivity and reduces ceiling effects.
astrocytes convert network excitation to tonic inhibition of neurons gabaa receptors not only respond to the local release of gaba from presynaptic terminals, but can also mediate a persistent 'tonic current'. this reflects the activation of high-affinity gabaa receptors by ambient gaba concentrations. tonic gabaa-receptor-mediated signalling occurs in different brain regions, shows cell-type-specific differences in magnitude and pharmacology, and changes during brain development. some clues to the adaptive significance of this phenomenon are beginning to emerge: in cerebellar granule cells, it alters the gain of transmission of rate-coded sensory information; in the hippocampus, it acts in a cell-type-specific manner to regulate the excitability of the network. because tonic conductances can be modulated by changes in gaba release and uptake, and by modulators of high-affinity gabaa receptors including neurosteroids, this phenomenon provides a potentially important new window onto neuronal information processing and pathological states such as epilepsy.
co-expression and clinical utility of snail and n-cadherin in papillary thyroid carcinoma abstract. cancer is caused by a series of genomic changes leading directly or indirectly to disturbance of growth, differentiation and tissue integrity. genomic, transcriptional or posttranscriptional alterations of e-cadherin/catenin complexes that are implicated in various steps of cancer development comprise mutational inactivation, transcriptional downregulation of e-cadherin sometimes accompanied by upregulation of n-cadherin, proteolysis of e-cadherin and posttranslational stabilisation of β-catenin and plakoglobin. the e-cadherin/catenin complex serves not only cell–cell adhesion but also transduces signals to the nucleus and to the cytoskeleton, either directly or through its connections with multiple other complexes. we review here the expression of e-cadherin/catenin in human cancers, emphasising methods of observation and prognostic interpretation of results. this is illustrated in thyroid lesions from the benign follicular adenoma to the extremely malignant anaplastic carcinoma. the eye is an organ largely neglected by students of cadherins and catenins. the implication of a variety of members of these molecular families in the embryonic development of the eye strongly suggests that disturbances of cadherin/catenin complexes are crucial also in the development of ocular tumours.
phylogeographical patterns shed light on evolutionary process in south america the making of amazonian diversity the biodiversity of the amazon basin is legendary, but the processes by which it has been generated have been debated. in the late 20th century the prevalent view was that the engine of diversity was repeated contraction and expansion of forest refugia during the past 3 million years or so. hoorn et al. (p. 927) analyze findings from a diverse range of disciplines, including molecular phylogeny, ecology, sedimentology, structural geology, and palaeontology, to offer an overview of the entire history of this region during the cenozoic era (66 million years ago). the uplift of the andes was a pivotal event in the evolution of amazonian landscapes because it continually altered river drainage patterns, which in turn put a variety of pressures on organisms to adapt to changing conditions in a multiplicity of ways. hence, the diversity of the modern biota of the amazon has more ancient origins than previously thought. the amazonian rainforest is arguably the most species-rich terrestrial ecosystem in the world, yet the timing of the origin and evolutionary causes of this diversity are a matter of debate. we review the geologic and phylogenetic evidence from amazonia and compare it with uplift records from the andes. this uplift and its effect on regional climate fundamentally changed the amazonian landscape by reconfiguring drainage patterns and creating a vast influx of sediments into the basin. on this “andean” substrate, a region-wide edaphic mosaic developed that became extremely rich in species, particularly in western amazonia. we show that andean uplift was crucial for the evolution of amazonian landscapes and ecosystems, and that current biodiversity patterns are rooted deep in the pre-quaternary.
maternal exposure to nitrogen dioxide during pregnancy and offspring birth weight: comparison of two exposure models background evidence suggests that air pollution exposure adversely affects pregnancy outcomes. few studies have examined individual-level intraurban exposure contrasts. objectives we evaluated the impacts of air pollution on small for gestational age (sga) birth weight, low full-term birth weight (lbw), and preterm birth using spatiotemporal exposure metrics. methods with linked administrative data, we identified 70,249 singleton births (1999–2002) with complete covariate data (sex, ethnicity, parity, birth month and year, income, education) and maternal residential history in vancouver, british columbia, canada. we estimated residential exposures by month of pregnancy using nearest and inverse-distance weighting (idw) of study area monitors [carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, nitric oxide, ozone, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter < 2.5 (pm2.5) or < 10 (pm10) μm in aerodynamic diameter], temporally adjusted land use regression (lur) models (no, no2, pm2.5, black carbon), and proximity to major roads. using logistic regression, we estimated the risk of mean (entire pregnancy, first and last month of pregnancy, first and last 3 months) air pollution concentrations on sga (< 10th percentile), term lbw (< 2,500 g), and preterm birth. results residence within 50 m of highways was associated with a 26% increase in sga [95% confidence interval (ci), 1.07–1.49] and an 11% (95% ci, 1.01–1.23) increase in lbw. exposure to all air pollutants except o3 was associated with sga, with similar odds ratios (ors) for lur and monitoring estimates (e.g., lur: or = 1.02; 95% ci, 1.00–1.04; idw: or = 1.05; 95% ci, 1.03–1.08 per 10-μg/m3 increase in no). for preterm births, associations were observed with pm2.5 for births < 37 weeks gestation (and for other pollutants at < 30 weeks). no consistent patterns suggested exposure windows of greater relevance. conclusion associations between traffic-related air pollution and birth outcomes were observed in a population-based cohort with relatively low ambient air pollution exposure.
non-neutralizing antibodies alter the course of hiv-1 infection in vivo a monoclonal antibody (694/98-d) directed toward the v3 loop of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) was evaluated for pre- and postexposure prophylaxis in scid mice reconstituted with human peripheral blood lymphocytes (hu-pbl-scid). fifty percent protection against the hiv-1lai strain was obtained by preexposure administration of 1.32 mg/kg antibody. however, virus isolated from 1 mouse 3 weeks after passive immunization with 13.2 mg/kg antibody proved resistant to subsequent in vitro neutralization by 694/98-d. v3 loop sequence analysis of cloned virus revealed amino acid changes within the linear core epitope recognized by 694/98-d and in one flanking amino acid. further evaluation of 694/98-d for postexposure prophylaxis in mice revealed that 694/ 98-d was effective when given 15 min after virus. however, efficacy declined to 50% if treatment was delayed to 1 h after virus inoculation. these studies point out some potential drawbacks of passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies.
cox-2/mpges-1/pge2 cascade activation mediates uric acid-induced mesangial cell proliferation hyperuricemia is associated with renal disease, but it is usually considered a marker of renal dysfunction rather than a risk factor for progression. recent studies have reported that mild hyperuricemia in normal rats induced by the uricase inhibitor, oxonic acid (oa), results in hypertension, intrarenal vascular disease, and renal injury. this led to the hypothesis that uric acid may contribute to progressive renal disease. to examine the effect of hyperuricemia on renal disease progression, rats were fed 2% oa for 6 wk after 5/6 remnant kidney (rk) surgery with or without the xanthine oxidase inhibitor, allopurinol, or the uricosuric agent, benziodarone. renal function and histologic studies were performed at 6 wk. given observations that uric acid induces vascular disease, the effect of uric acid on vascular smooth muscle cells in culture was also examined. rk rats developed transient hyperuricemia (2.7 mg/dl at week 2), but then levels returned to baseline by week 6 (1.4 mg/dl). in contrast, rk+oa rats developed higher and more persistent hyperuricemia (6 wk, 3.2 mg/dl). hyperuricemic rats demonstrated higher bp, greater proteinuria, and higher serum creatinine than rk rats. hyperuricemic rk rats had more renal hypertrophy and greater glomerulosclerosis (24.2 +/- 2.5 versus 17.5 +/- 3.4%; p < 0.05) and interstitial fibrosis (1.89 +/- 0.45 versus 1.52 +/- 0.47; p < 0.05). hyperuricemic rats developed vascular disease consisting of thickening of the preglomerular arteries with smooth muscle cell proliferation; these changes were significantly more severe than a historical rk group with similar bp. allopurinol significantly reduced uric acid levels and blocked the renal functional and histologic changes. benziodarone reduced uric acid levels less effectively and only partially improved bp and renal function, with minimal effect on the vascular changes. to better understand the mechanism for the vascular disease, the expression of cox-2 and renin were examined. hyperuricemic rats showed increased renal renin and cox-2 expression, the latter especially in preglomerular arterial vessels. in in vitro studies, cultured vascular smooth muscle cells incubated with uric acid also generated cox-2 with time-dependent proliferation, which was prevented by either a cox-2 or txa-2 receptor inhibitor. hyperuricemia accelerates renal progression in the rk model via a mechanism linked to high systemic bp and cox-2-mediated, thromboxane-induced vascular disease. these studies provide direct evidence that uric acid may be a true mediator of renal disease and progression.
effect of cocaine on ion channels and glutamatergic epscs in noradrenergic locus coeruleus neurons although cocaine binds to several sites in the brain, the biochemical receptor mechanism or mechanisms associated with its dependence producing properties are unknown. it is shown here that the potencies of cocaine-like drugs in self-administration studies correlate with their potencies in inhibiting [3h]mazindol binding to the dopamine transporters in the rat striatum, but not with their potencies in binding to a large number of other presynaptic and postsynaptic binding sites. thus, the cocaine receptor related to substance abuse is proposed to be the one associated with dopamine uptake inhibition.
the anti-ovarian cancer activity by wye-132, a mtorc1/2 dual inhibitor sphingolipid metabolites have emerged as critical players in a number of fundamental biological processes. among them, sphingosine-1-phosphate (s1p) promotes cell survival and proliferation, in contrast to ceramide and sphingosine, which induce cell growth arrest and apoptosis. these sphingolipids with opposing functions are interconvertible inside cells, suggesting that a finely tuned balance between them can determine cell fate. sphingosine kinases (sphks), which catalyze the phosphorylation of sphingosine to s1p, are critical regulators of this balance. of the two identified sphks, sphingosine kinase type 1 (sphk1) has been shown to regulate various processes important for cancer progression and will be the focus of this review, since much less is known of biological functions of sphk2, especially in cancer. sphk1 is overexpressed in various types of cancers and upregulation of sphk1 has been associated with tumor angiogenesis and resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. many growth factors, through their tyrosine kinase receptors (rtks), stimulate sphk1 leading to a rapid increase in s1p. this s1p in turn can activate s1p receptors and their downstream signaling. conversely, activation of s1p receptors can induce transactivation of various rtks. thus, sphk1 may play important roles in s1p receptor rtk amplification loops. here we review the role of sphk1 in tumorigenesis, hormonal therapy, chemotherapy resistance, and as a prognostic marker. we will also review studies on the effects of sphk inhibitors in cells in vitro and in animals in vivo and in some clinical trials and highlight the potential of sphk1 as a new target for cancer therapeutics.
transcript abundance, enzyme activity and metabolite concentration regulates differential carboxylate efflux in soybean under low phosphorus stress crop nutrition is frequently inadequate as a result of the expansion of cropping into marginal lands, elevated crop yields placing increasing demands on soil nutrient reserves, and environmental and economic concerns about applying fertilizers. plants exposed to nutrient deficiency activate a range of mechanisms that result in increased nutrient availability in the rhizosphere compared with the bulk soil. plants may change their root morphology, increase the affinity of nutrient transporters in the plasma membrane and exude organic compounds (carboxylates, phenolics, carbohydrates, enzymes, etc.) and protons. chemical changes in the rhizosphere result in altered abundance and composition of microbial communities. nutrient-efficient genotypes are adapted to environments with low nutrient availability. nutrient efficiency can be enhanced by targeted breeding through pyramiding efficiency mechanisms in a desirable genotype as well as by gene transfer and manipulation. rhizosphere microorganisms influence nutrient availability; adding beneficial microorganisms may result in enhanced availability of nutrients to crops. understanding the role of plant-microbe-soil interactions in governing nutrient availability in the rhizosphere will enhance the economic and environmental sustainability of crop production.
energetics of bacterial growth: balance of anabolic and catabolic reactions. batch cultures of escherichia coli were grown in minimal media supplemented with various carbon sources which supported growth at specific growth rates from 0.2 to 1.3/h. the respiration rates of the cultures were measured continuously. with few exceptions, the specific rate of oxygen consumption was about 20 mmol of o2/h per g (dry weight), suggesting that the respiratory capacity was limited at this value. the adenosine triphosphate (atp) required for the production of cell material from the different carbon sources was calculated on the basis of known atp requirements in the biochemical pathways and routes of macromolecular synthesis. the calculated atp requirements, together with the measured growth rates and growth yields on the different carbon sources, were used to calculate the rate of atp synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation. this rate was closely related to the respiration rate. we suggest that aerobic growth of e. coli in batch cultures is limited by the rate of respiration and the concomitant rate of atp generation through oxidative phosphorylation.
the ability of cbcl dsm-oriented scales to predict dsm-iv diagnoses in a referred sample of children and adolescents department of psychology, bryn mawr college separately for ages 11/2 to 5 and 6 to 18, used items for rating behavioral and emotional problems to construct (a) "top-down" dsm-oriented scales from experts' ratings of the items' consistency with diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th ed. [dsm-iv], american psychiatric association, 1994) categories, and (b) "bottom-up" empirically based syndromes from factor analyses of parent, caregiver, teacher, and self ratings (n = 14,853). both kinds of scales are scored from the same assessment instruments and are displayed on profiles normed on the same national samples. psychometric properties were similar for both kinds of scales. associations between counterpart scales were medium to strong. quantified, normed dsm-oriented and empirically based scales scored from the same instruments can facilitate assessment of individuals, statistical analyses for research purposes, and integration of top-down and bottom-up approaches to deriving constructs for psychopathology.
response of rat tibia to prolonged unloading under the influence of electrical stimulation at the dorsal root ganglion calcitonin gene-related peptide (cgrp), a 37 amino acid peptide resulting from the specific maturation processes of calcitonin gene products, was discovered in 1982. its messenger rna was isolated from a calcitonin cancer in rats similar to the human thyroid medullary carcinoma. cgrp is closely related to calcitonin and amylin, and to a lesser extent, to the region coding for the alpha chains of relaxins, insulin and insulin growth factors. in thyroid c cells, calcitonin itself is the major gene product, but cgrp is predominant in the central and peripheral nervous system. cgrp is found in most all tissues and is considered to be a neuromediator of particular importance in the cardiovascular system. cgrp is a powerful endogenous vasodilator in man; plasma concentrations of 56 pmol/l (slightly above physiological levels) provoke flush, hypotension and secondary catecholamine release and subsequent tachycardia. intravenous injections lead to systemic vasodilatation and redistribution of blood flow to the skin, the brain, and probably the splanchnic territory. it has been suggested that cgrp plays a role in blood pressure modulation in certain pathological conditions. cgrp level is decreased in hypertension and increased in septic shock. in patients with terminal renal failure, cgrp is correlated with excess volaemia. it could affect blood pressure by redistributing blood flow, interacting with the renin-angiotensin system or by inhibiting aldosterone secretion. cgrp may also play a role in modulating cutaneous vascular constriction in raynaud's syndrome and cerebral vascularization in patients with migraine or meningeal hemorrhage subsequent to rupture of cerebral aneurisms. cgrp increases arterial flow in the cavernous body. coronarian vascular tone and cardiac performance (positive chronotrope and inotrope effects) are improved. cgrp has also been studied in connection with glucose metabolism and may have other endocrine effects. finally, cgrp increases electrolyte and water flow in the colon and its bronchoconstrictor effect could be implicated in asthma. the clinical significance of plasma cgrp is not yet known although it may be a marker of poor prognosis in thyroid medullary cancer. recent studies suggest that cgrp could be a useful therapeutic agent in severe raynaud syndrome, impotency, ischaemic neurological lesions due to ruptured aneurisms and in severe heart failure.
the mechanisms of detoxification of as(iii), dimethylarsinic acid (dma) and as(v) in the microalga chlorella vulgaris. the synthesis of phytochelatins (pcs) in a marine alga, dunalliela tertiolecta, is strongly induced by zn. pretreatment of the cells with zn enhances the tolerance toward toxic heavy metals such as cd, hg, cu, pb, and arsenate. moreover, the pretreatment also increases the tolerance toward oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide or paraquat. in vitro analysis shows that pc is a stronger scavenger of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radical than glutathione. these results suggest that pcs inducibly synthesized by zn treatment could play a role not only in detoxification of heavy metals but also in mitigation of oxidative stress.
modeling pulmonary fibrosis by abnormal expression of telomerase/apoptosis/collagen v in experimental usual interstitial pneumonia this study was undertaken to test whether the structural remodelling of pulmonary parenchyma can be sequentially altered in a model and method that demonstrate the progression of the disease and result in remodelling within the lungs that is typical of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. three groups of mice were studied: (i) animals that received 3‐5‐di‐tert‐butyl‐4‐hydroxytoluene (bht) and were killed after 2 weeks (early bht = 9); (ii) animals that received bht and were killed after 4 weeks (late bht = 11); (iii) animals that received corn oil solution (control = 10). the mice were placed in a ventilated plexiglas chamber with a mixture of pure humidified oxygen and compressed air. lung histological sections underwent haematoxylin–eosin, immunohistochemistry (epithelial, endothelial and immune cells) and specific staining (collagen/elastic fibres) methods for morphometric analysis. when compared with the control group, early bht and late bht groups showed significant decrease of type ii pneumocytes, lower vascular density in both and higher endothelial activity. cd4 was increased in late bht compared with early and control groups, while cd8, macrophage and neutrophil cells were more prominent only in early bht. the collagenous fibre density were significantly higher only in late bht, whereas elastic fibre content in late bht was lower than that in control group. we conclude that the bht experimental model is pathologically very similar to human usual interstitial pneumonia. this feature is important in the identification of animal models of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis that can accurately reflect the pathogenesis and progression of the human disease.
effect of diet and exercise on body composition, energy intake and leptin levels in overweight women and men purpose the purpose of this study was to examine the physiological effects of a weight-loss dietary regimen with or without exercise.   methods thirty-five overweight men were matched and randomly placed into either a control group (c; n = 6) or one of three dietary groups; a diet-only group (d; n = 8), a diet group that performed aerobic exercise three times per week (de; n = 11); and a diet group that performed both aerobic and strength training three times per week (des; n = 10).   results after 12 wk, d, de, and des demonstrated a similar and significant (p < or = 0.05) reduction in body mass (-9.64, -8.99, and -9.90 kg, respectively) with fat mass comprising 69, 78, and 97% of the total loss in body mass, respectively. the diet-only group also demonstrated a significant reduction in fat-free mass. maximum strength, as determined by 1-rm testing in the bench press and squat exercise was significantly increased for des in both the bench press (+19.6%) and squat exercise (+32.6%). absolute peak o2 consumption was significantly elevated in de (+24.8%) and des (+15.4%). there were no differences in performance during a 30-s wingate test for the de and des, whereas d demonstrated a significant decline in peak and mean power output. resting metabolic rate (rmr) (kcal x d(-1)) was not significantly different for any of the groups except for the de group. there were no significant changes in basal concentrations of serum glucose, bun, cortisol, testosterone, and high density lipoprotein (hdl) cholesterol for any of the groups. serum total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol were significantly decreased for all dietary groups. serum triglycerides were significantly reduced for d and des at week 6 and remained lower at week 12 for d, while triglycerides returned to baseline values for des.   conclusions these data indicate that a weight-loss dietary regimen in conjunction with aerobic and resistance exercise prevents the normal decline in fat-free mass and muscular power and augments body composition, maximal strength, and maximum oxygen consumption compared with weight-loss induced by diet alone.
hairpins participating in folding of human telomeric sequence quadruplexes studied by standard and t-remd simulations explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations have been used to complement preceding experimental and computational studies of folding of guanine quadruplexes (g-dna). we initiate early stages of unfolding of several g-dnas by simulating them under no-salt conditions and then try to fold them back using standard excess salt simulations. there is a significant difference between g-dnas with all-anti parallel stranded stems and those with stems containing mixtures of syn and anti guanosines. the most natural rearrangement for all-anti stems is a vertical mutual slippage of the strands. this leads to stems with reduced numbers of tetrads during unfolding and a reduction of strand slippage during refolding. the presence of syn nucleotides prevents mutual strand slippage; therefore, the antiparallel and hybrid quadruplexes initiate unfolding via separation of the individual strands. the simulations confirm the capability of g-dna molecules to adopt numerous stable locally and globally misfolded structures. the key point for a proper individual folding attempt appears to be correct prior distribution of syn and anti nucleotides in all four g-strands. the results suggest that at the level of individual molecules, g-dna folding is an extremely multi-pathway process that is slowed by numerous misfolding arrangements stabilized on highly variable timescales.
nnll-fast: predictions for coloured supersymmetric particle production at the lhc with threshold and coulomb resummation abstract in qcd hard scattering cross sections, the color content of the underlying hard scattering evolves with a factorization scale. this evolution is controlled by an anomalous dimension matrix, specific to each hard-scattering reaction. anomalous dimensions are determined from the renormalization of products of ordered exponentials of the gauge field, which describe the coherent radiation of gluons by incoming hadrons and the observed jets or particles of the final state. the anomalous dimensions depend on the kinematics of the underlying hard scattering, but are free of collinear singularities. a number of these matrices are available in the literature. here, we exhibit one-loop mixing matrices for the full list of 2 → 2 reactions involving light quarks and gluons. the eight-by-eight anomalous dimension matrix for gluon-gluon scattering shows a simplified structure in the basis corresponding to definite color exchange in the t -channel.
a method for extracting a high-quality rna from symbiodinium sp. backgroundthe integrity of rna molecules is of paramount importance for experiments that try to reflect the snapshot of gene expression at the moment of rna extraction. until recently, there has been no reliable standard for estimating the integrity of rna samples and the ratio of 28s:18s ribosomal rna, the common measure for this purpose, has been shown to be inconsistent. the advent of microcapillary electrophoretic rna separation provides the basis for an automated high-throughput approach, in order to estimate the integrity of rna samples in an unambiguous way.methodsa method is introduced that automatically selects features from signal measurements and constructs regression models based on a bayesian learning technique. feature spaces of different dimensionality are compared in the bayesian framework, which allows selecting a final feature combination corresponding to models with high posterior probability.resultsthis approach is applied to a large collection of electrophoretic rna measurements recorded with an agilent 2100 bioanalyzer to extract an algorithm that describes rna integrity. the resulting algorithm is a user-independent, automated and reliable procedure for standardization of rna quality control that allows the calculation of an rna integrity number (rin).conclusionour results show the importance of taking characteristics of several regions of the recorded electropherogram into account in order to get a robust and reliable prediction of rna integrity, especially if compared to traditional methods.
neural basis of reward anticipation and its genetic determinants a review of the existing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) studies on reward anticipation in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd) is provided. meta-analysis showed a significant medium effect size (cohen's d=0.48-0.58) in terms of ventral-striatal (vs)-hyporesponsiveness in adhd. studies on vs-responsiveness and trait impulsivity in the healthy population demonstrate the opposite relationship, i.e. impulsivity-scores positively correlated with vs activation during reward processing. against the background that adhd may represent an extreme on a continuum of normal variability, the question arises as to how these contrasting findings can be integrated. we discuss three theoretical approaches, each of which integrates the opposing findings: (1) an inverted-u-shape model; (2) a (genetic) moderator model; and (3) the "unrelated model". we conclude that at the present stage the number of existing studies in the healthy population as well as in adhd groups is too small for a final answer. therefore, our presented integrative approaches should be understood as an attempt to frame future research directions by generating testable hypotheses and giving practical suggestions for future studies.
expression of the potential therapeutic target cxxc5 in primary acute myeloid leukemia cells - high expression is associated with adverse prognosis as well as altered intracellular signaling and transcriptional regulation acute myeloid leukemia (aml) frequently comprises mutations in genes that cause perturbation in intracellular signaling pathways, thereby altering normal responses to growth factors and cytokines. such oncogenic cellular signal transduction may be therapeutic if targeted directly or through epigenetic regulation. we treated 24 selected elderly aml patients with all-trans retinoic acid for 2 days before adding theophylline and the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid (clinicaltrials.gov nct00175812; eudract no. 2004-001663-22), and sampled 11 patients for peripheral blood at day 0, 2 and 7 for single-cell analysis of basal level and signal-transduction responses to relevant myeloid growth factors (granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-3, flt3l, stem cell factor, erythropoietin, cxcl-12) on 10 signaling molecules (creb, stat1/3/5, p38, erk1/2, akt, c-cbl, zap70/syk and rps6). pretreatment analysis by unsupervised clustering and principal component analysis divided the patients into three distinguishable signaling clusters (non-potentiated, potentiated basal and potentiated signaling). signal-transduction pathways were modulated during therapy and patients moved between the clusters. patients with multiple leukemic clones demonstrated distinct stimulation responses and therapy-induced modulation. individual signaling profiles together with clinical and hematological information may be used to early identify aml patients in whom epigenetic and signal-transduction targeted therapy is beneficial.
functional characterization of two alternatively spliced transcripts of tomato abscisic acid insensitive3 (abi3) gene the arabidopsisgene abi3 shows developmentally regulated alternative splicing. abi3-α and abi3-β splice variants encode full-length and truncated abi3 proteins, respectively. the conserved splicing factor sua reduces splicing of a cryptic abi3 intron, which leads to the accumulation of abi3-α. mutations in sua suppress the frameshift mutant abi3-5 by restoring its reading frame. abscisic acid insensitive3 (abi3) is a major regulator of seed maturation in arabidopsis thaliana. we detected two abi3 transcripts, abi3-α and abi3-β, which encode full-length and truncated proteins, respectively. alternative splicing of abi3 is developmentally regulated, and the abi3-β transcript accumulates at the end of seed maturation. the two abi3 transcripts differ by the presence of a cryptic intron in abi3-α, which is spliced out in abi3-β. the suppressor of abi3-5 (sua) mutant consistently restores wild-type seed features in the frameshift mutant abi3-5 but does not suppress other abi3 mutant alleles. sua is a conserved splicing factor, homologous to the human protein rbm5, and reduces splicing of the cryptic abi3 intron, leading to a decrease in abi3-β transcript. in the abi3-5 mutant, abi3-β codes for a functional abi3 protein due to frameshift restoration.
the effect of nmda receptors on gain modulation shunting inhibition, a conductance increase with a reversal potential close to the resting potential of the cell, has been shown to have a divisive effect on subthreshold excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitudes. it has therefore been assumed to have the same divisive effect on firing rates. we show that shunting inhibition actually has a subtractive effecton the firing rate in most circumstances. averaged over several interspike intervals, the spiking mechanism effectively clamps the somatic membrane potential to a value significantly above the resting potential, so that the current through the shunting conductance is approximately independent of the firing rate. this leads to a subtractive rather than a divisive effect. in addition, at distal synapses, shunting inhibition will also have an approximately subtractive effect if the excitatory conductance is not small compared to the inhibitory conductance. therefore regulating a cell's passive membrane conductancefor instance, via massive feedbackis not an adequate mechanism for normalizing or scaling its output.
gnx-4728, a novel small molecule drug inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition, is therapeutic in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis alzheimer’s disease (ad), parkinson’s disease (pd) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) are the most common human adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases. they are characterized by prominent age-related neurodegeneration in selectively vulnerable neural systems. some forms of ad, pd, and als are inherited, and genes causing these diseases have been identified. nevertheless, the mechanisms of the neuronal cell death are unresolved. morphological, biochemical, genetic, as well as cell and animal model studies reveal that mitochondria could have roles in this neurodegeneration. the functions and properties of mitochondria might render subsets of selectively vulnerable neurons intrinsically susceptible to cellular aging and stress and overlying genetic variations, triggering neurodegeneration according to a cell death matrix theory. in ad, alterations in enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, oxidative damage, and mitochondrial binding of aβ and amyloid precursor protein have been reported. in pd, mutations in putative mitochondrial proteins have been identified and mitochondrial dna mutations have been found in neurons in the substantia nigra. in als, changes occur in mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes and mitochondrial cell death proteins. transgenic mouse models of human neurodegenerative disease are beginning to reveal possible principles governing the biology of selective neuronal vulnerability that implicate mitochondria and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. this review summarizes how mitochondrial pathobiology might contribute to neuronal death in ad, pd, and als and could serve as a target for drug therapy.
conserved and muscle-group-specific gene expression patterns shape postnatal development of the novel extraocular muscle phenotype. abstract the genetic and epigenetic influences that establish and maintain the unique phenotype of the extraocular muscles (eoms) are poorly understood. the vestibulo-ocular reflex (vor) represents an important input into the eoms, as it stabilizes eye position relative to the environment and provides a platform for function of all other eye movement systems. a role for vestibular cues in shaping eom maturation was assessed in these studies using the ototoxic nitrile compound 3’,3’-iminodipropionitrile (idpn) to eliminate the receptor hair cells that drive the vestibulo-ocular reflex. intraperitoneal injections of idpn were followed by a 2-week survival period, after which myosin heavy chain (myhc) analysis of the eoms was performed. when idpn was administered to juvenile rats, the proportion of eye muscle fibers expressing developmental and fast myosins was increased, while eom-specific myhc mrna levels were downregulated. by contrast, idpn treatment in adult rats affected only the proportion of fibers expressing developmental myhc isoforms, leaving the eom-specific myhc mrna unaltered. these data provide evidence that the vor modulates eom-specific myhc expression in development. the lack of significant changes in eom-specific myhc expression in adult eom following idpn administration suggests that there may be a critical period during development when alterations in vestibular activity have significant and permanent consequences for the eye muscles.
amelioration of arthritis through mobilization of peptide-specific cd8+ regulatory t cells. animal models have been used extensively in studies of rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis. despite the inherent limitations of all animal models, several rodent models have significantly progressed our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underpinning rheumatoid arthritis and contributed to several current major advances in treatment. these models include the induced arthritis models such as collagen‐induced arthritis, collagen‐antibody‐induced arthritis, zymosan‐induced arthritis, and the methylated bsa model, and the genetically manipulated or spontaneous arthritis models such as the tnf‐α‐transgenic mouse, k/bxn mouse, and the skg mouse. here, we describe these animal models and discuss their advantages and limitations.
cestode parasites release extracellular vesicles with micrornas and immunodiagnostic protein cargo. introduction in recent years, there has been an exponential increase in the number of studies aiming to understand the biology of exosomes, as well as other extracellular vesicles. however, classification of membrane vesicles and the appropriate protocols for their isolation are still under intense discussion and investigation. when isolating vesicles, it is crucial to use systems that are able to separate them, to avoid cross-contamination. method evs released from three different kinds of cell lines: hmc-1, tf-1 and bv-2 were isolated using two centrifugation-based protocols. in protocol 1, apoptotic bodies were collected at 2,000×g, followed by filtering the supernatant through 0.8 µm pores and pelleting of microvesicles at 12,200×g. in protocol 2, apoptotic bodies and microvesicles were collected together at 16,500×g, followed by filtering of the supernatant through 0.2 µm pores and pelleting of exosomes at 120,000×g. extracellular vesicles were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy, flow cytometry and the rna profiles were investigated using a bioanalyzer®. results rna profiles showed that ribosomal rna was primary detectable in apoptotic bodies and smaller rnas without prominent ribosomal rna peaks in exosomes. in contrast, microvesicles contained little or no rna except for microvesicles collected from tf-1 cell cultures. the different vesicle pellets showed highly different distribution of size, shape and electron density with typical apoptotic body, microvesicle and exosome characteristics when analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. flow cytometry revealed the presence of cd63 and cd81 in all vesicles investigated, as well as cd9 except in the tf-1-derived vesicles, as these cells do not express cd9. conclusions our results demonstrate that centrifugation-based protocols are simple and fast systems to distinguish subpopulations of extracellular vesicles. different vesicles show different rna profiles and morphological characteristics, but they are indistinguishable using cd63-coated beads for flow cytometry analysis.
epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr )-targeted immunoliposomes mediate specific and efficient drug delivery to egfr-and egfrviii-overexpressing tumor cells 1 purpose anti-her2 immunoliposomes combine the tumor-targeting of certain anti-her2 monoclonal antibodies (mabs) with the pharmacokinetic and drug delivery capabilities of sterically stabilized liposomes. we previously showed that anti-her2 immunoliposomes bind efficiently to and internalize in her2-overexpressing cells in vitro, resulting in intracellular drug delivery.   experimental design here we describe the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy of anti-her2 immunoliposomes containing doxorubicin (dox) in a series of animal models.   results immunoliposomes displayed long circulation that was identical to that of sterically stabilized liposomes in single- and multiple-dose studies in normal rats. anti-her2 immunoliposome-dox produced marked therapeutic results in four different her2-overexpressing tumor xenograft models, including growth inhibition, regression, and cures. these results demonstrated that encapsulation of dox in anti-her2 immunoliposomes greatly increased its therapeutic index, both by increasing antitumor efficacy and by reducing systemic toxicity. immunoliposome-dox was significantly superior to all other treatment conditions tested, including free dox, liposomal dox, and anti-her2 mab (trastuzumab). when compared with liposomal dox in eight separate therapy studies in her2-overexpressing models, immunoliposome delivery produced significantly superior antitumor efficacy in each study (p < 0.0001 to 0.04). anti-her2 immunoliposome-dox containing either recombinant human mab her2-fab' or scfv c6.5 yielded comparable therapeutic efficacy. cure rates for immunoliposome-dox reached 50% (11 of 21) with optimized immunoliposomes and matrigel-free tumors and overall was 16% (18 of 115) versus no cures (0 of 124) with free dox or liposomal dox. finally, anti-her2 immunoliposome-dox was also superior to combinations consisting of free mab plus free dox or free mab plus liposomal dox.   conclusions anti-her2 immunoliposomes produced enhanced antitumor efficacy via targeted delivery.
trans-splenic access for portal venous interventions in children: do benefits outweigh risks? purpose to present methods and results of interventional treatment of children with portal hypertension (ph) secondary to portal vein occlusion (pvo).   material and methods five children, four boys and one girl, 8 - 14 years old, with symptomatic ph secondary to pvo were treated. all children had one or more episodes of bleeding from oesophageal varices, enlarged spleen and thrombocytopenia. partial embolisation of the spleen was performed in four children. attempts to recanalize the occluded part of the portal vein were done in all children using transjugular (n = 4), transhepatic (n = 4) and transsplenic (n = 3) approaches.   results all procedures were carried out without serious complications and were followed by normalisation of the platelet count, decrease in splenic size and disappearance of bleeding. recanalisation of the occluded portal vein with a stent was possible in one child and partial stent recanalisation was possible in another child. transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (tips) with partly extrahepatic, intraperitoneal route was created in one patient. all children were scheduled for follow-up. during the observation time of 22 months (5 - 46 months), additional balloon dilation and placement of new stents were necessary in two children.   conclusion interventional procedures are valuable in the treatment of children with symptoms secondary to pvo. treatment should be customized and scheduled follow-ups of the patients are necessary.
interactions of formulation excipients with proteins in solution and in the dried state. sarcosine and sorbitol at 10–30% (w/w) stabilized haemoglobin from human erythrocytes to thermal denaturation. at 65 °c, the protein's half life was increased from 0.85 to 50 min in 30% sarcosine and to 24 min in 30% sorbitol. a kinetic analysis based on the lumry-eyring mechanism of inactivation showed that the denaturation process can be described by a second-order rate expression with an apparent activation energy ranging from 56 to 87 kcal mol−1.
a mitochondria-anchored isoform of the actin-nucleating spire protein regulates mitochondrial division masterminding mitochondrial fission mitochondria are highly dynamic and undergo fusion and fission and they move in cells. defects in mitochondrial dynamics are implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases. recent findings have suggested that mitochondrial fission occurs preferentially at endoplasmic reticulum (er) contact sites, with er circumscribing mitochondria and possibly promoting the constriction of mitochondria during fission. korobova et al. (p. 464) now suggest that an er-localized formin, inf2, is required for mitochondrial fission and that inf2-mediated actin polymerization facilitates mitochondrial constriction. actin filaments between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria promote mitochondrial fission. mitochondrial fission is fundamentally important to cellular physiology. the dynamin-related protein drp1 mediates fission, and interaction between mitochondrion and endoplasmic reticulum (er) enhances fission. however, the mechanism for drp1 recruitment to mitochondria is unclear, although previous results implicate actin involvement. here, we found that actin polymerization through er-localized inverted formin 2 (inf2) was required for efficient mitochondrial fission in mammalian cells. inf2 functioned upstream of drp1. actin filaments appeared to accumulate between mitochondria and inf2-enriched er membranes at constriction sites. thus, inf2-induced actin filaments may drive initial mitochondrial constriction, which allows drp1-driven secondary constriction. because inf2 mutations can lead to charcot-marie-tooth disease, our results provide a potential cellular mechanism for this disease state.
azd5363 inhibits inflammatory synergy between interleukin-17 and insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 the il-17 receptor triggers dual, sequential phosphorylation of the transcription factor c/ebpβ, which represses the expression of target genes. getting negative interleukin 17 (il-17) is a proinflammatory cytokine that is important in mediating immune responses to infectious organisms. in addition, il-17 plays a critical role in the pathology of autoimmune disorders. recently, an il-17–secreting population of t cells, termed t helper 17 (th17), has been identified as a distinct t cell lineage, stimulating interest in the properties of these cells and the signaling mechanisms of il-17. il-17 signals through a receptor complex consisting of il-17ra and il-17rc subunits, which have several structural features that distinguish them from other cytokine receptors. signaling through il-17ra leads to the activation of the transcription factors nf-κb, c/ebpδ, and c/ebpβ. although il-17ra–mediated activation of nf-κb and c/ebpδ is well understood, how il-17 regulates the activity of c/ebpβ is unclear. shen et al. used tandem mass spectrometry and other experiments to show that il-17ra signaling led to the sequential, dual phosphorylation of c/ebpβ. whereas the first phosphorylation event depended on the activity of extracellular signal–regulated kinase, the second depended on that of glycogen synthase kinase 3β. phosphorylation of c/ebpβ resulted in repressed expression of il-17 target genes, the first characterized negative consequence of il-17r signaling. interleukin-17 (il-17), the hallmark cytokine of t helper 17 (th17) cells, signals through a distinct receptor subclass, yet little is known about the mechanisms involved. il-17 activates the expression of target genes through the actions of the transcription factors nuclear factor κb (nf-κb), caat enhancer binding protein δ (c/ebpδ), and c/ebpβ. the adaptor proteins tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 6 (traf6) and act1 are upstream of nf-κb and c/ebpδ, but the regulation of c/ebpβ remains undefined. here, we show that il-17 signaling led to phosphorylation of two sites in the regulatory 2 domain of c/ebpβ in a sequential, interdependent fashion. the first was rapid and dependent on extracellular signal–regulated kinase (erk), whereas the second was dependent on the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (gsk-3β). these pathways were mediated by distinct subdomains within il-17 receptor a (il-17ra). whereas phosphorylation of threonine 188 (thr188) was mediated by the previously identified sef/il-17r homology domain–toll-il-1r–like loop (sefir-till), phosphorylation of thr179 occurred through a newly characterized motif located in the distal tail of il-17ra. phosphorylated c/ebpβ mediated a negative signal, because blocking erk and gsk-3β increased expression of il-17 target genes and a c/ebpβ-thr188 mutant enhanced activation of a c/ebp-dependent reporter. overexpression of gsk-3β inhibited il-17–induced activation of a c/ebp-dependent reporter, and thr179 of c/ebpβ was not phosphorylated in gsk-3β–deficient cells. thus, il-17 triggered the dual phosphorylation of c/ebpβ, which inhibited the expression of proinflammatory genes. this detailed dissection is the first for the il-17–mediated c/ebp pathway and the first known example of a negative signal mediated by il-17ra.
divergence measures and message passing important inference problems in statistical physics, computer vision, error-correcting coding theory, and artificial intelligence can all be reformulated as the computation of marginal probabilities on factor graphs. the belief propagation (bp) algorithm is an efficient way to solve these problems that is exact when the factor graph is a tree, but only approximate when the factor graph has cycles. we show that bp fixed points correspond to the stationary points of the bethe approximation of the free energy for a factor graph. we explain how to obtain region-based free energy approximations that improve the bethe approximation, and corresponding generalized belief propagation (gbp) algorithms. we emphasize the conditions a free energy approximation must satisfy in order to be a "valid" or "maxent-normal" approximation. we describe the relationship between four different methods that can be used to generate valid approximations: the "bethe method", the "junction graph method", the "cluster variation method", and the "region graph method". finally, we explain how to tell whether a region-based approximation, and its corresponding gbp algorithm, is likely to be accurate, and describe empirical results showing that gbp can significantly outperform bp.
trajectory optimization of cable parallel manipulators in point-to- point motion in this paper, a computational method for obtaining maximum dynamic load-carrying capacity (dlcc) of the cable-suspended parallel manipulator is developed. the manipulator is assumed to be a rigid manipulator and the joint actuator torque and cable tension force capacities are considered as the major limiting factors in determining the maximum payload. the maximum dynamic payload-carrying capacity of the manipulator is established while the dynamic model of a typical actuator system is used in the joint actuator force capacity for a given trajectory. the proposed constraint completes a common framework for dynamic characterization of a cable-suspended parallel robot. the 3 and 6 degrees of freedom cable robots are presented for computing the maximum dlcc.
xcs-based reinforcement learning algorithm for motion planning of a spherical mobile robot reinforcement learning allows an agent to be both reactive and adaptive, but it requires a simple yet consistent representation of the task environment. in robotics this representation is the product of perception. perception is a powerful simplifying mechanism because it ignores much of the complexity of the world by mapping multiple world states to each of a few representational states. the constraint of consistency conflicts with simplicity, however. a consistent representation distinguishes world states that have distinct utilities, but perception systems with sufficient acuity to do this tend to also make many unnecessary distinctions.in this paper we discuss reinforcement learning and the problem of appropriate perception. we then investigate a method for dealing with the problem, called thelion algorithm [1], and show that it can be used to reduce complexity by decomposing perception. the lion algorithm does not allow iterative rules to be learned, and we describe modifications that overcome this limitation. we present experimental results that demonstrate their effectiveness in further reducing complexity. finally, we mention some related research, and conclude with suggestions for further work.
control of kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus reactivation induced by multiple signals abstract human herpesvirus 8 (hhv-8) (also known as kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus) encodes a novel noncoding polyadenylated nuclear (pan) rna (also known as t1.1 or nut-1) during the early phase of lytic replication. pan rna is the most abundant transcript of hhv-8, comprising 80% of total poly(a)-selected transcripts in hhv-8-infected cells during lytic replication. we directly measured the abundance of pan rna by visualizing 1.1- to 1.2- kb pan rna in an ethidium bromide-stained gel from poly(a)-selected rna. we further pursued the mechanisms by which pan rna expression is induced to such high levels.rta, an immediate-early gene of hhv-8, is a transactivator that is sufficient and necessary to activate lytic gene expression in latently infected cells. ectopic expression of rta was previously shown to induce pan rna expression from the endogenous viral genome and activate the pan promoter in a reporter system. here, we have identified the rta-responsive element (rre) in the pan promoter. deletion analysis revealed that the rre is present in a region between nucleotides −69 and −38 of the pan promoter. a promoter construct containing the 69 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site of the pan promoter was activated by rta in the absence or presence of the hhv-8 genome. rta activated the pan promoter up to 7,000-fold in 293t cells and 2,000-fold in b cells. electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that rta formed a highly stable complex with the rre of the pan promoter. our study suggests that rta can induce pan rna expression by direct binding of rta to the rre of the pan promoter. this study has highlighted an important mechanism controlling pan rna expression and also provides a model system for investigating how rta transactivates gene expression during lytic replication.
development of dipicolylamine-modified cyclodextrins for the design of selective guest-responsive receptors for atp in this feature article, we focus on recent advances in our research on molecular recognition and fluorescence sensing of phosphate anion derivatives of biological importance. because of their significant roles in biological systems, considerable efforts have been devoted to developing detection or determination systems. however, the recognition and sensing of these anion species under aqueous biological conditions using small-molecular chemosensors still remain as a challenging research topic. we have been developing a variety of artificial receptors and fluorescent chemosensors for phosphoproteins and nucleoside polyphosphates in recent years. they consist of a binuclear zn(ii)-dipicolylamine (dpa) complex as a common binding motif for phosphate anion derivatives. taking advantage of their strong binding affinities or high sensing abilities, a variety of biological assay systems have also been successfully developed, which includes the enzyme assays such as the kinase, phosphatase and glycosyltransferase reaction, as well as an inhibitor assay for the phosphoprotein-protein surface interaction.
physical constraints on the evolution of cooperation a model is presented to account for the natural selection of what is termed reciprocally altruistic behavior. the model shows how selection can operate against the cheater (non-reciprocator) in the system. three instances of altruistic behavior are discussed, the evolution of which the model can explain: (1) behavior involved in cleaning symbioses; (2) warning cries in birds; and (3) human reciprocal altruism. regarding human reciprocal altruism, it is shown that the details of the psychological system that regulates this altruism can be explained by the model. specifically, friendship, dislike, moralistic aggression, gratitude, sympathy, trust, suspicion, trustworthiness, aspects of guilt, and some forms of dishonesty and hypocrisy can be explained as important adaptations to regulate the altruistic system. each individual human is seen as possessing altruistic and cheating tendencies, the expression of which is sensitive to developmental variables that were selected to set the tendencies at a balance appropriate to the local social and ecological environment.
cu (ii) binded chitosan/fe3o4 nanocomomposite as a new biosorbent for efficient and selective removal of phosphate. phosphorus (p) is an essential element for all life forms, it is a mineral nutrient. orthophosphate is the only form of p that autotrophs can assimilate. extracellular enzymes hydrolyze organic forms of p to phosphate. eutrophication is the overenrichment of receiving waters with mineral nutrients. the results are excessive production of autotrophs, especially algae and cyanobacteria. this high productivity leads to high bacterial populations and high respiration rates, leading to hypoxia or anoxia in poorly mixed hottom waters and at night in surface waters during calm, warm conditions. low dissolved oxygen causes the loss of aquatic animals and release of many materials normally hound to hottom sediments including various forms of p. this release of p reinforces the eutrophication. excessive concentrations of p is the most common cause of eutrophication in freshwater lakes, reservoirs. streams, and headwaters of estuarine systems. in the ocean, n becomes the key mineral nutrient controlling primary production. estuaries and continental shelf waters are a transition zone, where excessive p and n create prohlems. it is best to measure and regulate total p inputs to whole aquatic ecosystems, but for an easy assay it is hest to measure total p concentrations, induding particulate p, in surface waters or nip atomic ratios in phytoplankton.
aging, opioid-receptor agonists and antagonists, and the vestibulosympathetic reflex in humans. animal studies have demonstrated increases in sympathetic nerve outflow with vestibular stimulation. the purpose of the present study was to determine whether vestibulosympathetic reflexes are engaged in humans. muscle sympathetic nerve activity (msna), heart rate, arterial pressure, calf blood flow (cbf), and calculated calf vascular resistance (cvr; mean arterial pressure/cbf) were determined during 10 min of baseline (laying prone with chin supported) and 10 min of head-down neck flexion (hdnf). msna responses were measured in nine subjects, and calf vascular responses were determined in seven of these subjects. heart rate increased during the first minute of hdnf (71 +/- 2 to 76 +/- 3 beats/min; p < 0.05) and remained slightly elevated (71 +/- 2 to 74 +/- 3 beats/min; p < 0.05) for the duration of hdnf. diastolic and mean arterial pressures also increased slightly with hdnf (80 +/- 3 to 82 +/- 3 and 96 +/- 3 to 98 +/- 3 mmhg, respectively; p < 0.05). systolic arterial pressure did not change significantly during hdnf. cbf decreased 14% (4.63 +/- 0.78 to 3.97 +/- 0.60 ml x min(-1) x 100 ml(-1); p < 0.05), and cvr increased 12% (24.0 +/- 4.3 to 27.4 +/- 4.7 units; p < 0.05) during hdnf. these changes corresponded with significant increases in msna during hdnf. msna, expressed as burst frequency, increased from 14 +/- 2 to 20 +/- 2 bursts/min (p < 0.05) and increased 63 +/- 23% (p < 0.05) when expressed as the percent change in total activity. all variables returned to baseline during recovery. thoracic impedance measured in five subjects did not change during hdnf (19.6 +/- 1.2 to 19.7 +/- 1.5 omega), suggesting no major change in central blood volume. the results indicate that hdnf elicits increases in cvr that are mediated by the augmentation of msna. arterial pressure responses and thoracic impedance data suggest that high and low pressure baroreflexes were not the mechanism for sympathetic activation. the immediate increase in msna with hdnf suggests a role for vestibulosympathetic reflexes.
the association between androgen receptor gene cag polymorphism and polycystic ovary syndrome: a case-control study and meta-analysis polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos) is a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age. the disorder is characterized by clinical features of hyperandrogenism, menstrual irregularities and often central obesity and hyperinsulinaemia. pcos may increase the risk for infertility, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia, cardiovascular disease and endometrial cancer, emphasizing the need for early diagnosis of the syndrome. the genetic basis of pcos is unknown. there is a strong familial component but the mode of inheritance is uncertain and several candidate genes have been proposed to contribute to susceptibility. not only genes involved in steroid hormone biosynthesis have been studied but also genes associated with the regulation of insulin secretion and action since hyperinsulinaemia is a characteristic of pcos. so far there is evidence that ins vntr (insulin variable number of tandem repeats) or cyp11alpha (cholesterol side chain cleavage) genes are associated with this syndrome. pcos appears, however, to be an oligogenic disorder and more studies are necessary to define the genetic basis.
econometrics and operational research efficient portfolio selection in a large market in portfolio analysis, uncertainty about parameter values leads to suboptimal portfolio choices. the resulting loss in the investor's utility is a function of the particular estimator chosen for expected returns. so, this is a problem of simultaneous estimation of normal means under a well-specified loss function. in this situation, as stein has shown, the classical sample mean is inadmissible. this paper presents a simple empirical bayes estimator that should outperform the sample mean in the context of a portfolio. simulation analysis shows that these bayes-stein estimators provide significant gains in portfolio selection problems.
field isotopic study of lead fate and compartmentalization in earthworm-soil-metal particle systems for highly polluted soil near pb recycling factory. the importance of earthworms to ecosystem functioning has led to many studies on the impacts of metals on earthworms. far less attention has been paid to the impact that earthworms have on soil metals both in terms of metal mobility and availability. in this review we consider which earthworms have been used in such studies, which soil components have been investigated, which types of soil have been used and what measures of mobility and availability applied. we proceed to review proposed reasons for effects: changes in microbial populations, ph, dissolved organic carbon and metal speciation. the balance of evidence suggests that earthworms increase metal mobility and availability but more studies are required to determine the precise mechanism for this.
sequence and gene content of a large fragment of a lizard sex chromosome and evaluation of candidate sex differentiating gene r-spondin 1 an individual's sex depends upon its genes (genotypic sex determination or gsd) in birds and mammals, but reptiles are more complex: some species have gsd whereas in others, nest temperatures determine offspring sex (temperature-dependent sex determination). previous studies suggested that montane scincid lizards (bassiana duperreyi, scincidae) possess both of these systems simultaneously: offspring sex is determined by heteromorphic sex chromosomes (xx–xy system) in most natural nests, but sex ratio shifts suggest that temperatures override chromosomal sex in cool nests to generate phenotypically male offspring even from xx eggs. we now provide direct evidence that incubation temperatures can sex-reverse genotypically female offspring, using a dna sex marker. application of exogenous hormone to eggs also can sex-reverse offspring (oestradiol application produces xy as well as xx females). in conjunction with recent work on a distantly related lizard taxon, our study challenges the notion of a fundamental dichotomy between genetic and thermally determined sex determination, and hence the validity of current classification schemes for sex-determining systems in reptiles.
cestode parasites release extracellular vesicles with micrornas and immunodiagnostic protein cargo. introduction in recent years, there has been an exponential increase in the number of studies aiming to understand the biology of exosomes, as well as other extracellular vesicles. however, classification of membrane vesicles and the appropriate protocols for their isolation are still under intense discussion and investigation. when isolating vesicles, it is crucial to use systems that are able to separate them, to avoid cross-contamination. method evs released from three different kinds of cell lines: hmc-1, tf-1 and bv-2 were isolated using two centrifugation-based protocols. in protocol 1, apoptotic bodies were collected at 2,000×g, followed by filtering the supernatant through 0.8 µm pores and pelleting of microvesicles at 12,200×g. in protocol 2, apoptotic bodies and microvesicles were collected together at 16,500×g, followed by filtering of the supernatant through 0.2 µm pores and pelleting of exosomes at 120,000×g. extracellular vesicles were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy, flow cytometry and the rna profiles were investigated using a bioanalyzer®. results rna profiles showed that ribosomal rna was primary detectable in apoptotic bodies and smaller rnas without prominent ribosomal rna peaks in exosomes. in contrast, microvesicles contained little or no rna except for microvesicles collected from tf-1 cell cultures. the different vesicle pellets showed highly different distribution of size, shape and electron density with typical apoptotic body, microvesicle and exosome characteristics when analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. flow cytometry revealed the presence of cd63 and cd81 in all vesicles investigated, as well as cd9 except in the tf-1-derived vesicles, as these cells do not express cd9. conclusions our results demonstrate that centrifugation-based protocols are simple and fast systems to distinguish subpopulations of extracellular vesicles. different vesicles show different rna profiles and morphological characteristics, but they are indistinguishable using cd63-coated beads for flow cytometry analysis.
which body fat anthropometric indicators are most strongly associated with maximum oxygen uptake in adolescents objective to determine the association of lean vs fat mass with fitness in healthy, overweight and obese african americans from families with early-onset coronary disease.   design cross-sectional study.   setting baltimore, maryland.   participants 191 healthy, overweight, sedentary african americans (69% women; aged 44.8 ± 11 years; body mass index 34 ± 5 kg/m2).   main outcome measures anthropometrics, smoking, blood pressure, lipids, c-reactive protein, and glucose were assessed with standard methods; body composition was determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry; cardiorespiratory fitness was expressed as vo(2peak) attained during a maximal treadmill test.   results in both men and women, greater lean mass was independently associated with higher vo(2peak) (p < .05) and explained > 21% of the variance in vo(2peak), adjusted for body mass index, fat mass, important covariables, and nonindependence of families.   conclusions in this cross-sectional study, lean mass was the key determinant of cardiorespiratory fitness, independent of sex, age, and magnitude of obesity. these data provide a strong rationale for examining whether interventions that increase lean mass may also improve fitness, even among high-risk overweight and obese african americans.
verbal labels modulate perceptual object processing in 1-year-old children the induced gamma-band eeg response (igbr) recorded on the scalp is widely assumed to reflect synchronous neural oscillation associated with object representation, attention, memory, and consciousness. the most commonly reported eeg igbr is a broadband transient increase in power at the gamma range approximately 200-300 ms following stimulus onset. a conspicuous feature of this igbr is the trial-to-trial poststimulus latency variability, which has been insufficiently addressed. here, we show, using single-trial analysis of concomitant eeg and eye tracking, that this igbr is tightly time locked to the onset of involuntary miniature eye movements and reflects a saccadic "spike potential." the time course of the igbr is related to an increase in the rate of saccades following a period of poststimulus saccadic inhibition. thus, whereas neuronal gamma-band oscillations were shown conclusively with other methods, the broadband transient igbr recorded by scalp eeg reflects properties of miniature saccade dynamics rather than neuronal oscillations.
the comparative psychology of avian visual cognition pigeons and humans chose which one of two alternative visual forms was identical to, or a mirror image of, a previously presented sample form. the two comparison forms were presented in various orientations with respect to the sample. the two species yielded similar accuracies, but although human reaction times depended linearly on the angular disparities, those of the pigeon did not. humans appeared to apply a well-known, thoughtlike, mental rotation procedure to the problem, whereas pigeons seemed to rely on a more efficient automatic process that humans can use only in simpler rotational invariance tasks. mirror-image forms may be better discriminated by the pigeon's visual system than by the human one.
post-translational regulation of rotavirus protein nsp1 expression in mammalian cells ns53 (nsp1), the gene 5 product of the group a rotaviruses, is a minor nonstructural protein of 486 to 495 amino acids which binds zinc and contains an amino-terminal highly conserved cysteine-rich region that may form one or two zinc fingers. to study the structure-function of the gene 5 product, wild-type and mutant forms of ns53 were produced by using a recombinant baculovirus expression system and a recombinant vaccinia virus/t7 (vtf7-3) expression system. analysis of the rna-binding activity of the wild-type ns53 immobilized onto protein a-sepharose beads with ns53-specific antiserum showed that the protein exhibited specific affinity for all 11 rotavirus mrnas. the use of short virus-specific rna probes indicated that ns53 specifically recognizes an element located near the 5' ends of viral mrnas. analysis of the rna-binding activity of deletion mutants of ns53 showed that the rna-binding domain resides within the first 81 amino acids of the protein and that the highly conserved cysteine-rich region within this region of the protein is essential for the activity. gel electrophoresis and western immunoblot analyses of intracellular fractions derived from infected cells revealed that large amounts of ns53 were present in the cytosol and in association with the cytoskeletal matrix. indirect immunofluorescence analysis of cells programmed to transiently express mutant forms of ns53 using vtf7-3 indicated that the intracellular localization domain resides between amino acids 84 and 176 of ns53. together, these data show that the rna-binding domain and the intracellular localization domain lie upstream from the region of ns53 previously determined not to be essential for replication of rotaviruses in cell culture (j. hua and j. t. patton, virology 198:567-576, 1994).
regulators of trypanosoma brucei cell cycle progression and differentiation identified using a kinome-wide rnai screen the interaction of insulin and growth factors with their receptors on the outside surface of a cell, leads to the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi 3-kinase) and generation of the phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (ptdins(3,4,5)p3) second messenger at the inner surface of the cell membrane. one of the most studied signalling events controlled by ptdins(3,4,5)p3, comprises the activation of a group of agc family protein kinases, including isoforms of protein kinase b (pkb)/akt, p70 ribosomal s6 kinase (s6k), serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase (sgk) and protein kinase c (pkc), which play crucial roles in regulating physiological processes relevant to metabolism, growth, proliferation and survival. here, we review recent biochemical, genetic and structural studies on the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (pdk1), which phosphorylates and activates the agc kinase members regulated by pi 3-kinase. we also discuss whether inhibitors of pdk1 might have chemotherapeutic potential in the treatment of cancers in which the pdk1-regulated agc kinases are constitutively activated.
novel variants of a histogram shift-based reversible watermarking technique for medical images to improve hiding capacity this paper proposes a blind reversible watermarking approach for medical images based on histogram shifting in wavelet domain. an integer wavelet transform is applied to map the integer host image components to integer wavelet coefficients. the watermark information is inserted into the high frequency subband regions of the transformed image. according to the capacity required for the watermark, two thresholds, t1 and t2, are selected, one in the begging part and the other in the end part of the histogram of the high frequency subbands of the transformed image. two zero-points, z1 and z2 are also created by properly shifting the beginning and the end parts of the histogram. the part of the histogram located between the two thresholds remains unchanged. the binary watermark data are inserted in the thresholds and zero-points locations. the high psnr (above 53 db) obtained for several watermarked medical images, indicates imperceptibility of the approach. experimental results also show superiority of the proposed approach in compare to some other methods that are based on histogram shifting in spatial as well as integer wavelet domains. enabling lossless reconstruction of both watermark and host image, beside providing the high quality for the watermarked image, make the proposed approach attractive for medical image watermarking applications.
mrc1 marks early-firing origins and coordinates timing and efficiency of initiation in fission yeast † the swi1‐swi3 replication fork protection complex and mrc1 protein are required for stabilization of stalled replication forks in fission yeast. hsk1 kinase also plays roles in checkpoint responses elicited by arrested replication forks. we show that both swi1 and swi3, the abundance of which are interdependent, are required for chromatin association of mrc1. co‐immunoprecipitation experiments show the interactions of swi1‐swi3, mrc1 and hsk1. mrc1 interacts with swi3 and hsk1 proteins through its central segment (378–879) containing a sq/tq cluster, and this segment is sufficient for checkpoint reaction. the sq/tq cluster segment (536–673) is essential but not sufficient for the interactions and for resistance to replication inhibitor hydroxyurea. mrc1 protein level is increased in hsk1–89 cells due to apparent stabilization, and we have identified a potential phosphodegron sequence. these results suggest that interactions of the swi1‐swi3 complex and hsk1 kinase with mrc1 may play a role in cellular responses to stalled replication forks in fission yeast.

penile reconstruction: evaluation of the most accepted techniques. a series of six consecutive cases of total penile reconstruction with a sensitive forearm free flap based on the radial artery is presented. a simple, reliable, and easily reproducible technique with an acceptable aesthetic appearance is described. no partial or complete flap losses were found. the only complication found in three patients was a urinary fistula on the distal third of the flap, which was repaired successfully with a secondary surgical procedure. the aesthetic and functional outcome was satisfactory to the patient and surgical team in all cases. a sensitive radial forearm free flap is a good choice of treatment for total penile reconstruction. © 2000 wiley‐liss, inc. microsurgery 20:181–185 2000
ionizing irradiation induces apoptotic damage of salivary gland acinar cells via nadph oxidase 1-dependent superoxide generation. human whole saliva contains a number of antimicrobial agents, and lysozyme, lactoferrin, secretory iga and peroxidase are among the best known. peroxidase catalyzes a reaction involved in the inhibition of bacterial growth and metabolism, and the prevention of hydrogen peroxide accumulation, thus protecting proteins from the action of oxygen and reactive oxygen species (ros). to better understand the role played by the oxidative stress in the aging process, we studied the relationship between total protein content, peroxidase activity, malondialdehyde (mda) and nitric oxide (no) content of human unstimulated whole saliva in 169 healthy subjects subdivided into groups according to age. our results show a significant decrease in peroxidase activity with age. moreover, the increase in saliva lipid peroxide levels indicates an enhanced free radical production that may contribute to tissue damage. on the other hand, findings concerning human unstimulated whole saliva no content showed a significant increase in elderly subjects, suggesting that an enhanced no production might depend on a stimulation of leukocyte-inducible no synthase (i-nos) activity. our results suggest that during aging the oral tissues may become more susceptible to environmental factors due to a modification in the balance between different antimicrobial agents.
multiple predator based capture process on complex networks in spite of the extensive previous efforts on traffic dynamics and epidemic spreading in complex networks, the problem of traffic-driven epidemic spreading on correlated networks has not been addressed. interestingly, we find that the epidemic threshold, a fundamental quantity underlying the spreading dynamics, exhibits a nonmonotonic behavior in that it can be minimized for some critical value of the assortativity coefficient, a parameter characterizing the network correlation. to understand this phenomenon, we use the degree-based mean-field theory to calculate the traffic-driven epidemic threshold for correlated networks. the theory predicts that the threshold is inversely proportional to the packet-generation rate and the largest eigenvalue of the betweenness matrix. we obtain consistency between theory and numerics. our results may provide insights into the important problem of controlling and/or harnessing real-world epidemic spreading dynamics driven by traffic flows.
the inability of bacillus licheniformis perr mutant to grow is mainly due to the lack of perr-mediated fur repression perr is a ferric uptake repressor (fur) homolog that functions as the central regulator of the inducible peroxide stress response in bacillus subtilis. perr has been previously demonstrated to regulate the mrga, kata, ahpcf, hemaxcdbl, and zosa genes. we now demonstrate that perr also mediates both the repression of its own gene and that of fur. whereas perr-mediated repression of most target genes can be elicited by either manganese or iron, repression of perr and fur is selective for manganese. genetic studies indicate that repression of perr regulon genes by either manganese or iron requires perr and is generally independent of fur. indeed, in a fur mutant, iron-mediated repression is enhanced. unexpectedly, repression of the fur gene by manganese appears to require both perr and fur, but only perr binds to the fur regulatory region in vitro. the fur mutation appears to act indirectly by affecting cellular metal ion pools and thereby affecting perr-mediated repression. while many components of the perr regulon are strongly induced by hydrogen peroxide, little, if any, induction of fur and perr could be demonstrated. thus, not all components of the perr regulon are components of the peroxide stimulon. we suggest that perr exists in distinct metallated forms that differ in dna target selectivity and in sensitivity to oxidation. this model is supported by the observation that the metal ion composition of the growth medium can greatly influence the transcriptional response of the various perr regulon genes to hydrogen peroxide.
sources of seasonal fractional integration in macroeconomic time series a simple construction that will be referred to as an error-duration model is shown to generate fractional integration and long memory. an error-duration representation also exists for many familiar arma models, making error duration an alternative to autoregression for explaining dynamic persistence in economic variables. the results lead to a straightforward procedure for simulating fractional integration and establish a connection between fractional integration and common notions of structural change. two examples show how the error-duration model could account for fractional integration in aggregate employment and in asset price volatility.
anomalous behaviour detection using spatiotemporal oriented energies, subset inclusion histogram comparison and event-driven processing this paper presents an approach to representing and analyzing spatiotemporal information in support of making qualitative, yet semantically meaningful distinctions at the earliest stages of processing. a small set of primitive classes of spatiotemporal structure are proposed that correspond to categories of stationary, coherently moving, incoherently moving, flickering, scintillating and "too unstructured to support further inference". it is shown how these classes can be represented and distinguished in a uniform fashion in terms of oriented energy signatures. further, empirical results are presented that illustrate the use of the approach in application to natural imagery. the importance of the described work is twofold: (i) from a theoretical point of view a semantically meaningful decomposition of spatiotemporal information is developed. (ii) from a practical point of view, the developed approach has the potential to impact real world image understanding and analysis applications. as examples: the approach could be used to support early focus of attention and cueing mechanisms that guide subsequent activities by an intelligent agent; the approach could provide the representational substrate for indexing video and other spatiotemporal data.
genome-wide association with c-reactive protein levels in clhns: evidence for the crp and hnf1a loci and their interaction with exposure to a pathogenic environment obesity and infectious agents are both sources of inflammatory stimuli that result in increased production of c-reactive protein (crp). rates of overweight and obesity are increasing globally, but for many populations, gains in body fat are set against a backdrop of high levels of pathogen exposure. our primary objective was to evaluate the extent to which adiposity and pathogenicity contribute to a double burden of inflammation in a population currently undergoing the nutrition transition. measures of adiposity, pathogen exposure, and infectious disease symptoms were evaluated as predictors of high-sensitivity crp concentration in plasma samples from 1875 women participating in the cebu longitudinal health and nutrition survey in the philippines. proxy measures of pathogen exposure included household crowding and cleanliness, quality of water source, mode of waste disposal, and fecal exposure. a series of maximum likelihood logistic regression models were used to predict a plasma crp concentration > 3 mg/l. waist circumference was the strongest anthropometric predictor of elevated crp [odds ratio (or) = 2.29; 95% ci = 2.00, 2.62; p < 0.001]. presence of infectious disease symptoms (or = 2.51; 95% ci = 1.84, 3.44; p < 0.001) and level of pathogen exposure (or = 1.56; 95% ci = 1.15, 2.12; p < 0.01) were also associated with elevated crp. these associations were independent of socioeconomic status and other health behaviors. overweight/obesity and infectious exposures are associated with elevated crp in the philippines; it is likely that other populations undergoing the nutrition transition are experiencing comparable double burdens of inflammatory stimuli. these results underscore the need for additional research on the contributions of pathogenicity, adiposity, and inflammation to global epidemics of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.
the canonical e-box motif: a target for glucocorticoid action that drives rhythmic mouse pai-1 transcription in vitro. plasminogen activator inhibitor‐1 (pai‐1) is a key factor of fibrinolytic activity. the activity and mrna abundance show a daily rhythm. to elucidate the mechanism of daily pai‐1 gene expression, the expression of pai‐1 and several clock genes was examined in the heart of homozygous clock mutant (clock/clock) mice. damping of the daily oscillation of pai‐1 gene expression in clock/clock mice was accompanied with damped or attenuated oscillations of mper1, mper2, mbmal1, and mnpas2 mrna. daily restricted feeding induced a daily mrna rhythm of all clock genes and pai‐1 mrna in clock/clock mice as well as wild‐type mice. the peaks of clock genes and pai‐1 mrna were phase‐advanced in the heart of both genotypes after 6 days of restricted feeding. the present results demonstrate that daily pai‐1 gene expression depends on clock gene expression in the heart and that a functional clock gene is not required for restricted feeding‐induced resetting of the peripheral clock.
a small multifunctional pentatricopeptide repeat protein in the chloroplast of chlamydomonas reinhardtii. using the repeat finding algorithm ft-rep, we have identified 154 pentatricopeptide repeat (ppr) proteins in nine fully sequenced genomes from green algae (with a total of 1201 repeats) and grouped them in 47 orthologous groups. all data are available in a database, pprdb, accessible online at http://giavap-genomes.ibpc.fr/ppr. based on phylogenetic trees generated from the repeats, we propose evolutionary scenarios for ppr proteins. two pprs are clearly conserved in the entire green lineage: mrl1 is a stabilization factor for the rbcl mrna, while hcf152 binds in plants to the psbh-petb intergenic region. mca1 (the stabilization factor for peta) and ppr7 (a short ppr also acting on chloroplast mrnas) are conserved across the entire chlorophyta. the other pprs are clade-specific, with evidence for gene losses, duplications, and horizontal transfer. in some ppr proteins, an additional domain found at the c terminus provides clues as to possible functions. ppr19 and ppr26 possess a methyltransferase_4 domain suggesting involvement in rna guanosine methylation. ppr18 contains a c-terminal cbs domain, similar to the cbsppr1 protein found in nucleoids. ppr16, ppr29, ppr37, and ppr38 harbor a smr (muts-related) domain similar to that found in land plants ptac2, gun1, and svr7. the ppr-cyclins ppr3, ppr4, and ppr6, in addition, contain a cyclin domain c-terminal to their smr domain. ppr31 is an unusual ppr-cyclin containing at its n terminus an octotricopeptide repeat (opr) and a rap domain. we consider the possibility that ppr proteins with a smr domain can introduce single-stranded nicks in the plastid chromosome.
raf kinase inhibitor protein (rkip) blocks signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3) activation in breast and prostate cancer rkip-1 is a metastasis suppressor that is frequently downregulated in aggressive cancers. however, the consequences of rkip loss in primary or immortalized cells have not yet been explored. using hek-293 rkip depleted (termed hek-499) and flp-in t-rex-293 rkip inducible cell lines combined with whole transcriptome analysis, we show that rkip-1 silencing accelerates dna synthesis and g1/s transition entry by inducing the expression of cdc6, mcm 2, 4, 6, 7, cdc45l, cyclin d2, cyclin e2, cyclin d1, skp2 and the downregulation of p21(cip1). moreover, rkip depletion accelerates the time from nuclear envelop breakdown (neb) to anaphase markedly, while the upregulation of rkip shortened the neb to anaphase time. we show that rkip depletion induces the expression of nek6, a molecule known to enhance g2/m transition, and down-regulates g2/m checkpoint molecules like aurora b, cyclin g1 and sertuin that slow the g2/m transition time. these subtle changes in the kinetics of the cell cycle culminate in a higher proliferation rate of hek-499 compared to control cells. finally, we show that rkip depletion enhances cellular motility by inducing the expression/stabilization of β-catenin, vimentin, met and pak1. overall, our data suggest that modulation of the cell cycle checkpoints and motility by rkip may be fundamental to its metastasis suppressive function in cancer and that rkip role in a cell is more intricate and diverse than previously thought.
drinking green tea modestly reduces breast cancer risk. angiogenesis is a fundamental process by which new blood vessels are formed. the angiogenesis process is induced by several growth factors. among them angiogenin is the most potent blood vessel inducer known. in this paper, we have investigated the effect of green tea polyphenols, mainly the catechins, on an angiogenin-like protein induced angiogenesis process. the angiogenin-like protein was isolated from goat serum and the effect of green tea components was tested by the chicken chorioallantoic membrane (cam) assay. the results show that green tea components are capable of reducing the vascularization on cam that is induced by the angiogenin-like protein.
inhibition of regulated catecholamine secretion from pc12 cells by the ca2+/calmodulin kinase ii inhibitor kn-62. because synaptic vesicles and secretory granules are simple in composition and easy to purify, many of their protein components have been identified and often sequenced. attempts are underway to link the small number of membrane proteins to the small number of functions the vesicles perform. the discovery of sequence homologies has helped greatly with this. in addition, techniques that have begun to prove successful involve microinjection, identification of proteins that bind synaptic vesicle proteins, dna transfection into cells and oocytes, and more recently, in vitro reconstitution of exocytosis, endocytosis, and vesicle biogenesis. advances in the latter areas have been strongly influenced by the breakthroughs in our knowledge of membrane traffic in nonneuronal cells. the budding reactions involved in making synaptic vesicles and secretory granules resemble in many ways the generation of carrier vesicles from the er and the golgi complex. finally, exocytosis in neurons may closely resemble fusion of carrier vesicles with target organelles in nonneuronal cells, using complexes of peripheral membrane proteins, gtp hydrolysis, and integral membrane proteins with fusogenic domains. the usefulness of in vitro reconstitution, reverse genetics, and the parallels with better understood systems compensates in part for a major weakness in the field, namely the difficulty in obtaining viable mutants that are defective in the storage and release of secretory vesicle content.
towards a balanced view of the bacterial tree of life silva (from latin silva, forest, http://www.arb-silva.de) is a comprehensive web resource for up to date, quality-controlled databases of aligned ribosomal rna (rrna) gene sequences from the bacteria, archaea and eukaryota domains and supplementary online services. the referred database release 111 (july 2012) contains 3 194 778 small subunit and 288 717 large subunit rrna gene sequences. since the initial description of the project, substantial new features have been introduced, including advanced quality control procedures, an improved rrna gene aligner, online tools for probe and primer evaluation and optimized browsing, searching and downloading on the website. furthermore, the extensively curated silva taxonomy and the new non-redundant silva datasets provide an ideal reference for high-throughput classification of data from next-generation sequencing approaches.
impacts of sediments on coral energetics: partitioning the effects of turbidity and settling particles summarydespite the pre-eminence of the great barrier reef, there has been little systematic description of its biotic communities, and in particular, of the corals themselves. only recently have the problems of coral taxonomy been sufficiently resolved to allow a beginning to be made in rectifying this deficiency. the present study describes seventeen assemblages of corals which occupy the major habitat types found in and near the central great barrier reef. the habitats studied range from the wave swept reef flats of coral sea atolls to the slopes of small reefs occupying sheltered, muddy conditions near the coast. these, and the array of reefs between, have characteristic suites of coral communities which provide the basis for a classification of reefs into non-acropora reefs and various acropora reefs. it is speculated that the faunistic differences are maintained because reefs are primarily self-seeded and because the majority of larvae from external sources are of species which are already present. the greatest diversity of both species and community types was found on reefs near the middle of the continental shelf, while the oceanic atolls and nearshore silt-affected reefs are almost equally depauperate.
typical monoterpenes as insecticides and repellents against stored grain pests global warming and deforestation have resulted in the relocation of many living creatures including insects during the recent years. this has affected the population balance of disease vectors including mosquitoes resulting in outbreaks. traditionally, mankind has been using plants as means of protection from the mosquitoes which are considered to be environment friendly unlike the synthetic chemicals that cause major risk to human health and the ecosystem. researchers explored mainly, essential oils and traditional plants using different testing methodologies to find out repellent molecules effective against mosquitoes which is the main focus of this review. among the promising plant species, eucalyptus spp., ocimum spp. and cymbopogon spp. are the most cited. data of repellency produced from the bioassay systems is difficult to quantify because of different parameters, testing system and standards of material used against mosquitoes. mainly, the human forearm based bioassays have been used with different sizes of treatment area in the laboratory and the results have not been tested in the field conditions for residual activity. in addition, effectiveness of essential oils and their protection time can be increased by using vanillin as synergist and formulation techniques like microencapsulation and nanoemulsion. there is a need to develop an alternate in vitro bioassay system that can address the problems of uniformity of the results.
multi-level multi-task structured sparse learning for diagnosis of schizophrenia disease in multi-task learning (mtl), multiple related tasks are learned jointly by sharing information across them. many mtl algorithms have been proposed to learn the underlying task groups. however, those methods are limited to learn the task groups at only a single level, which may be not sufficient to model the complex structure among tasks in many real-world applications. in this paper, we propose a multi-level task grouping (metag) method to learn the multi-level grouping structure instead of only one level among tasks. specifically, by assuming the number of levels to be h, we decompose the parameter matrix into a sum of h component matrices, each of which is regularized with a l2 norm on the pairwise difference among parameters of all the tasks to construct level-specific task groups. for optimization, we employ the smoothing proximal gradient method to efficiently solve the objective function of the metag model. moreover, we provide theoretical analysis to show that under certain conditions the metag model can recover the true parameter matrix and the true task groups in each level with high probability. we experiment our approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing competitive performance over state-of-the-art mtl methods.
spatial and temporal variations of heavy metals in surface sediments in bohai bay, north china mollusks living in seas can accumulate heavy metals, and may serve as excellent passive biomonitors. during a period of 1 year, bioaccumulation of as, cd, co, cr, cu, fe, hg, mn, ni, pb, se, and zn was examined in nine kinds of mollusks (rapana venosa, neverita didyma, scapharca subcrenata, mytilus edulis, amusium, crassostrea talienwhanensis, meretix meretrix, ruditapes philippinarum, and mactra veneriformis), which were collected at eight coastal sites along the chinese bohai sea. metal concentrations were directly determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (icp-ms). two certified reference materials, dogfish muscle (dorm-2) and mussel (gbw 08571), were used to validate the methods, and the recoveries were within 83.72-112.30% of the certified values. bioaccumulation of metals varied strongly among sampling sites and species. statistical analysis (one-way anova) indicated that different species examined showed different bioaccumulation of metals, and perhaps they could be used as potential biomonitors to investigate the contamination levels of heavy metals. principal component analysis (pca) and correlation analysis were used to study the relationships between these heavy metals. the results showed that, in nine mollusks' tissues, there are significant correlations between these elements in adjacent main group or subgroup in periodic table of elements.
on clique-transversals and clique-independent sets abstract a minimum clique-transversal set mct ( g ) of a graph g =( v , e ) is a set s ⊆ v of minimum cardinality that meets all maximal cliques in g . a maximum clique-independent set mci ( g ) of g is a set of maximum number of pairwise vertex-disjoint maximal cliques. we prove that the problem of finding an mct ( g ) and an mci ( g ) is np -hard for cocomparability, planar, line and total graphs. as an interesting corollary we obtain that the problem of finding a minimum number of elements of a poset to meet all maximal antichains of the poset remains np -hard even if the poset has height two, thereby generalizing a result of duffas et al. (j. combin. theory ser. a 58 (1991) 158–164). we present a polynomial algorithm for the above problems on helly circular-arc graphs which is the first such algorithm for a class of graphs that is not clique-perfect . we also present polynomial algorithms for the weighted version of the clique-transversal problem on strongly chordal graphs, chordal graphs of bounded clique size, and cographs. the algorithms presented run in linear time for strongly chordal graphs and cographs. these mark the first attempts at the weighted version of the problem.
number of aberrant crypt foci associated with adiposity and igf1 bioavailability there is increasing evidence that dysregulation of energy homeostasis is associated with colorectal carcinogenesis. epidemiological data have consistently demonstrated a positive relation between increased body size and colorectal malignancy, whereas mechanistic studies have sought to uncover obesity-related carcinogenic pathways. the phenomenon of "insulin resistance" or the impaired ability to normalize plasma glucose levels has formed the core of these pathways, but other mechanisms have also been advanced. obesity-induced insulin resistance leads to elevated levels of plasma insulin, glucose and fatty acids. exposure of the colonocyte to heightened concentrations of insulin may induce a mitogenic effect within these cells, whereas exposure to glucose and fatty acids may induce metabolic perturbations, alterations in cell signaling pathways and oxidative stress. the importance of chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of obesity has recently been highlighted and may represent an additional mechanism linking increased adiposity to colorectal carcinogenesis. this review provides an overview of the epidemiology of body size and colorectal neoplasia and outlines current knowledge of putative mechanisms advanced to explain this relation. family based studies have shown that the propensity to become obese is heritable, but this is only manifest in conditions of excess energy intake over expenditure. inheritance of a genetic profile that predisposes to increased body size may also be predictive of colorectal cancer. genomewide scans, linkage studies and candidate gene investigations have highlighted more than 400 chromosomal regions that may harbor variants that predispose to increased body size. the genetics underlying the pathogenesis of obesity are likely to be complex, but variants in a range of different genes have already been associated with increased body size and insulin resistance. these include genes encoding elements of insulin signaling, adipocyte metabolism and differentiation, and regulation of energy expenditure. a number of investigators have begun to study genetic variants within these pathways in relation to colorectal neoplasia, but at present data remain limited to a handful of studies. these pathways will be discussed with particular reference to genetic polymorphisms that have been associated with obesity and insulin resistance.
poverty, process of care, and outcome in acute coronary syndromes. increasingly, investigators append census-based socioeconomic characteristics of residential areas to individual records to address the problem of inadequate socioeconomic information on health data sets. little empirical attention has been given to the validity of this approach. the authors estimate health outcome equations using samples from nationally representative data sets linked to census data. they investigate whether statistical power is sensitive to the timing of census data collection or to the level of aggregation of the census data; whether different census items are conceptually distinct; and whether the use of multiple aggregate measures in health outcome equations improves prediction compared with a single aggregate measure. the authors find little difference in estimates when using 1970 compared with 1980 us bureau of the census data or zip code compared with tract level variables. however, aggregate variables are highly multicollinear. associations of health outcomes with aggregate measures are substantially weaker than with microlevel measures. the authors conclude that aggregate measures can not be interpreted as if they were microlevel variables nor should a specific aggregate measure be interpreted to represent the effects of what it is labeled.
proteome changes in the initial bacterial colonist during ecological succession in an acid mine drainage biofilm community. bacterial species concepts are controversial. more widely accepted is the need to understand how differences in gene content and sequence lead to ecological divergence. to address this relationship in ecosystem context, we investigated links between genotype and ecology of two genotypic groups of leptospirillum group ii bacteria in comprehensively characterized, natural acidophilic biofilm communities. these groups share 99.7% 16s rrna gene sequence identity and 95% average amino acid identity between their orthologs. one genotypic group predominates during early colonization, and the other group typically proliferates in later successional stages, forming distinct patches tens to hundreds of micrometers in diameter. among early colonizing populations, we observed dominance of five genotypes that differed from each other by the extent of recombination with the late colonizing type. our analyses suggest that the specific recombinant variant within the early colonizing group is selected for by environmental parameters such as temperature, consistent with recombination as a mechanism for ecological fine tuning. evolutionary signatures, and strain-resolved expression patterns measured via mass spectrometry–based proteomics, indicate increased cobalamin biosynthesis, (de)methylation, and glycine cleavage in the late colonizer. this may suggest environmental changes within the biofilm during development, accompanied by redirection of compatible solutes from osmoprotectants toward metabolism. across 27 communities, comparative proteogenomic analyses show that differential regulation of shared genes and expression of a small subset of the ∼15% of genes unique to each genotype are involved in niche partitioning. in summary, the results show how subtle genetic variations can lead to distinct ecological strategies.
real-time imaging of tumor-cell shedding and trafficking in lymphatic channels. the purpose of this study was to determine the independent prognostic significanceof interstitial fluid pressure (ifp) measurements in cervix cancer. a total of 102 patients with newly diagnosed cervix cancer were accrued to this prospective study. there were 31 international federation of gynecology and obstetrics stage ib or iia tumors, 40 iib tumors, and 31 iiib tumors. the median size was 5 cm (range, 2-10 cm). pelvic lymphadenopathy was identified radiographically in 20 patients. ifp was measured at examination under anesthesia using a wick-in-needle technique. multiple measurements were made in each tumor. the mean ifp in individual tumors ranged from -3 to 48 mm hg, and the median for the entire cohort was 19 mm hg. treatment consisted of external beam and intracavitary radiation without chemotherapy. median follow-up was 2.5 years. the 3-year disease-free survival of all of the patients was 53%. disease-free survival was 34% in patients with ifp >19 mm hg, and 68% in those with lower ifp (p = 0.002). to evaluate rigorously the independent prognostic significance of ifp measurements relative to established clinical factors, a multivariate model was first developed using stepwise selection of clinical covariates. tumor size (p = 0.0003) and pelvic lymph node status (p = 0.0016) comprised the clinical model. ifp, when added to this model, provided additional independent prognostic information (p = 0.0013). ifp was also significant (p = 0.0027) when the clinical factors and hypoxic proportion as determined with the eppendorf electrode were analyzed together. patients with high ifp were more likely to recur both locally and at distant sites. this study is the first to document a strong, independent prognostic importance of pretreatment ifp measurements in cervix cancer. patients with high ifp are significantly more likely than those with low ifp to recur after radiotherapy and die of progressive disease, independent of clinical prognostic factors and the results of tumor oxygen measurements.
cyclicity and variability in prey dynamics strengthens predator numerical response: the effects of vole fluctuations on white stork productivity to model the effects of global climate phenomena on avian population dynamics, we must identify and quantify the spatial and temporal relationships between climate, weather and bird populations. previous studies show that in europe, the north atlantic oscillation (nao) influences winter and spring weather that in turn affects resident and migratory landbird species. similarly, in north america, the el nifno/ southern oscillation (enso) of the pacific ocean reportedly drives weather patterns that affect prey availability and population dynamics of landbird species which winter in the caribbean. here we show that enso- and nao-induced seasonal weather conditions differentially affect neotropicaland temperate-wintering landbird species that breed in pacific north-west forests of north america. for neotropical species wintering in western mexico, el nifio conditions correlate with cooler, wetter conditions prior to spring migration, and with high reproductive success the following summer. for temperate wintering species, springtime nao indices correlate strongly with levels of forest defoliation by the larvae of two moth species and also with annual reproductive success, especially among species known to prey upon those larvae. generalized linear models incorporating nao indices and enso precipitation indices explain 50-90% of the annual variation in productivity reported for 10 landbird species. these results represent an important step towards spatially explicit modelling of avian population dynamics at regional scales.
network-driven proteogenomics unveils an aging-related imbalance in the olfactory iκbα-nfκb p65 complex functionality in tg2576 alzheimer’s disease mouse model mice that overexpress the human mutant amyloid precursor protein (happ) show learning deficits, but the apparent lack of a relationship between these deficits and the progressive β-amyloid plaque formation that the happ mice display is puzzling. in the water maze, happ mice are impaired before and after amyloid plaque deposition. here we show, using a new water-maze training protocol, that pdapp mice also exhibit a separate age-related deficit in learning a series of spatial locations. this impairment correlates with β-amyloid plaque burden and is shown in both cross-sectional and longitudinal experimental designs. cued navigation and object-recognition memory are normal. these findings indicate that aβ overexpression and/or aβ plaques are associated with disturbed cognitive function and, importantly, suggest that some but not all forms of learning and memory are suitable behavioural assays of the progressive cognitive deficits associated with alzheimer's-disease-type pathologies.
response suppression in v1 agrees with psychophysics of surround masking contrast masking was studied psychophysically. a two-alternative forced-choice procedure was used to measure contrast thresholds for 2.0 cpd sine-wave gratings in the presence of masking sine-wave gratings. thresholds were measured for 11 masker contrasts spanning three log units, and seven masker frequencies ranging +/- one octave from the signal frequency. corresponding measurements were made for gratings with horizontal widths of 0.75 degrees (narrow fields) and 6.0 degrees (wide fields). for high contrast maskers at all frequencies, signal thresholds were related to masking contrast by power functions with exponents near 0.6. for a range of low masking contrasts, signal thresholds were reduced by the masker. for the wide fields, high contrast masking tuning functions peaked at the signal frequency, were slightly asymmetric, and had approximately invariant half-maximum frequencies that lie 3/4 octave below and 1 octave above the signal frequency. the corresponding low contrast tuning functions exhibited peak threshold reduction at the signal frequency, with half-minimum frequencies at roughly +/- 0.25 octaves. for the narrow fields, the masking tuning functions were much broader at both low and high masking contrasts. a masking model is presented that encompasses contrast detection, discrimination, and masking phenomena. central constructs of the model include a linear spatial frequency filter, a nonlinear transducer, and a process of spatial pooling that acts at low contrasts only.
proteomic response of the biological control fungus trichoderma atroviride to growth on the cell walls of rhizoctonia solani abstract chitinolytic and glucanolytic fungal cell wall-degrading enzymes have been suggested to be primary determinants of biocontrol bytrichoderma spp. we examined the effects of ammonium, glucose, chitin, and chito-oligomers on transcription of specific genes and secretion of fungal cell wall-degrading enzymes. the genesech42, nag1, andgluc78 were examined, as were the enzymes they encode (endochitinase chit42, n-acetylhexosaminidase chit73, and glucan exo-1,3-β-glucanase gluc78, respectively).gluc78 could be induced by nitrogen starvation alone, while both ech42 and nag1 required nitrogen starvation and the presence of chitin for induction. starvation for both ammonium and glucose resulted in very early expression and secretion of all cell wall-degrading enzymes examined. in the presence of low levels of ammonium (10 mm), both chito-oligomers and chitin triggered chit42 and chit40 (chitobiosidase) production. chit73 secretion occurred in the presence ofn-acetylglucosamine and chito-oligomers, while chitin was less effective. the presence of different chito-oligomers resulted in secretion of specific n-acetylhexosaminidases, of which chit73 is one. our results indicate that the expression and secretion of cell wall-degrading enzymes is nitrogen repressed, that effects of carbon and nitrogen nutrition are interactive, and that especially for chitinolytic enzymes, the inductive effect of chitin is altered by the level of ammonium or glucose in the medium.
mutations in the n-terminal coding region of the harpin protein hpa1 from xanthomonas oryzae cause loss of hypersensitive reaction induction in tobacco the hrp gene clusters of plant pathogenic bacteria control pathogenicity on their host plants and ability to elicit the hypersensitive reaction in resistant plants. some hrp gene products constitute elements of the type iii secretion system, by which effector proteins are exported and delivered into plant cells. here, we show that the hrpz gene product from the bean halo-blight pathogen, pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola (hrpz(psph)), is secreted in an hrp-dependent manner in p. syringae pv. phaseolicola and exported by the type iii secretion system in the mammalian pathogen yersinia enterocolitica. hrpz(psph) was found to associate stably with liposomes and synthetic bilayer membranes. under symmetric ionic conditions, addition of 2 nm of purified recombinant hrpz(psph) to the cis compartment of planar lipid bilayers provoked an ion current with a large unitary conductivity of 207 ps. hrpz(psph)-related proteins from p. syringae pv. tomato or syringae triggered ion currents similar to those stimulated by hrpz(psph). the hrpz(psph)-mediated ion-conducting pore was permeable for cations but did not mediate fluxes of cl-. such pore-forming activity may allow nutrient release and/or delivery of virulence factors during bacterial colonization of host plants.
lactase persistence may explain the paradoxical findings of high vitamin d concentrations in europeans living in areas of low uv-b irradiation vitamin d deficiency is now recognized as an epidemic in the united states. the major source of vitamin d for both children and adults is from sensible sun exposure. in the absence of sun exposure 1000 iu of cholecalciferol is required daily for both children and adults. vitamin d deficiency causes poor mineralization of the collagen matrix in young children's bones leading to growth retardation and bone deformities known as rickets. in adults, vitamin d deficiency induces secondary hyperparathyroidism, which causes a loss of matrix and minerals, thus increasing the risk of osteoporosis and fractures. in addition, the poor mineralization of newly laid down bone matrix in adult bone results in the painful bone disease of osteomalacia. vitamin d deficiency causes muscle weakness, increasing the risk of falling and fractures. vitamin d deficiency also has other serious consequences on overall health and well-being. there is mounting scientific evidence that implicates vitamin d deficiency with an increased risk of type i diabetes, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, cardiovascular heart disease, and many common deadly cancers. vigilance of one's vitamin d status by the yearly measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin d should be part of an annual physical examination.
polymorphisms in regulatory regions of cyclooxygenase-2 gene and breast cancer risk in brazilians: a case-control study the association between polymorphisms of cox-2 -765g>c and p53 codon 72, and oral squamous cell carcinoma (oscc) remains unclear. we investigated the associations between cox-2 and p53 polymorphisms, oral precancerous lesions (opl), and oscc. demographic data and substance use (smoking, drinking, and betel quid chewing) data were collected from 297 patients with oscc, 70 with oral leukoplakia (ol), 39 with oral submucosal fibrosis (osf), and 280 healthy controls. cox-2 and p53 polymorphisms were determined by pcr-rflp methods. a significantly higher proportion of oscc and opl patients were male, and frequent habitual users of the three substances. no association was found between p53 and cox-2 polymorphisms, ethnicity, and gender. polymorphisms of p53 were not associated with oscc development and malignant potential of opl, osf, and ol. the frequency of cox-2 -765g/g genotype was significantly higher in healthy controls (chi(2)=93.83, p<0.0001). after adjusting for possible confounding factors, cox-2 -765c allele vs. -765g/g genotype (or=0.22, 95%ci=0.12-0.39) was a protective factor against oscc development, but was a risk factor for malignant potential of osf (or=3.20, 95%ci=1.32-8.94) and ol (or=6.73, 95%ci=2.84-19.87). we suggest that cox-2 -765g>c polymorphisms play a different role in oscc development than in malignant potential of osf and ol. however, p53 codon 72 polymorphisms show no such correlation.
the opioid epidemic in the united states richard objectivesalthough the economic costs of substance misuse have been extensively examined in the published literature, information on the costs of nonmedical use of prescription opioids is much more limited, despite being a significant and rapidly growing problem in the united states. methodswe estimated the current economic burden of nonmedical use of prescription opioids in the united states in terms of direct substance abuse treatment, medical complications, productivity loss, and criminal justice. we distributed our broad cost estimates among the various drugs of misuse, including prescription opioids, down to the individual drug level. resultsin 2006, the estimated total cost in the united states of nonmedical use of prescription opioids was $53.4 billion, of which $42 billion (79%) was attributable to lost productivity, $8.2 billion (15%) to criminal justice costs, $2.2 billion (4%) to drug abuse treatment, and $944 million to medical complications (2%). five drugs—oxycontin, oxycodone, hydrocodone, propoxyphene, and methadone—accounted for two-thirds of the total economic burden. discussionthe economic cost of nonmedical use of prescription opioids in the united states totals more than $50 billion annually; lost productivity and crime account for the vast majority (94%) of these costs.
tumors skew endothelial cells to disrupt nk cell, t-cell and macrophage functions tumor-associated macrophages (tam) represent the major inflammatory component of the stroma of many tumors, able to affect different aspects of the neoplastic tissue. many observations indicate that tam express several m2-associated protumoral functions, including promotion of angiogenesis, matrix remodelling and suppression of adaptive immunity. the protumoral role of tam in cancer is further supported by clinical studies that found a correlation between the high macrophage content of tumors and poor patient prognosis and by evidence showing that long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduces the risk of several cancers. here, we discuss evidence supporting the view that tam represent a unique and distinct m2-skewed myeloid population and a potential target of anti-cancer therapy.
number of days required to estimate habitual activity using wrist-worn geneactiv accelerometer: a cross-sectional study purpose to examine sources of variance in objective measures of physical activity in a group of healthy adults (n = 92) participating in a physical activity measurement study.   methods physical activity was assessed for up to 21 consecutive days using the computer science applications (csa) accelerometer. day-of-the-week effects were evaluated for activity counts (ct.min(-1).d(-1), ct.d(-1)) and time (min.d(-1)) spent in inactivity (0-499 ct), moderate-1 (500-1951 ct), and moderate-2-vigorous activity (> or =1952 ct). random effects models were employed to estimate variance components for subject, day of the week, and residual error from which the number of days of assessment required to achieve 80% reliability were estimated.   results physical inactivity was lower on weekend days, and saturday was the least inactive day of the week for both men and women. inter-individual variation, or differences between subjects, was proportionally the largest source of variance (55-60% of total) in accelerometer counts and time spent in moderate to vigorous activity. differences within subjects (intra-individual variation) accounted for 30-45% of the overall variance, and day-of-the-week effects accounted for 1-8%. for activity counts, and time spent in moderate to vigorous activity, at least 3-4 d of monitoring were required to achieve 80% reliability. reliable measures of physical inactivity required at least 7 d of monitoring.   conclusion these findings provide insight for understanding the behavioral variability in the activity patterns of adults and suggest that reliable measures of activity behaviors require at least 7 d of monitoring.
force feedback facilitates multisensory integration during robotic tool use background to understand the process of skill acquisition in robotic surgery and to allow useful real-time feedback to surgeons and trainees in future generations of robotic surgical systems, robotic surgical skills should be determined with objective variables. the aim of this study was to assess skill acquisition through a training protocol, and to identify variables for the quantification of proficiency.   methods seven novice users of the da vinci surgical system engaged in 4 weeks of training that involved practicing three bimanual tasks with the system. seven variables were determined for assessing speed of performance, bimanual coordination, and muscular activation. these values were compared before and after training.   results significant improvements were observed through training in five variables. bimanual coordination showed differences between the surgical tasks used, whereas muscular activation patterns showed better muscle use through training. the subjects also performed the surgical tasks considerably faster within the first two to three training sessions.   conclusions the study objectively demonstrated that the novice users could learn to perform surgical tasks faster and with more consistency, better bimanual dexterity, and better muscular activity utilization. the variables examined showed great promise as objective indicators of proficiency and skill acquisition in robotic surgery.
inter-species transplantation of gut microbiota from human to pigs three 16s rrna hybridization probes were developed and tested for genus-specific detection of bifidobacterium species in the human fecal flora. variable regions v2, v4, and v8 of the 16s rrna contained sequences unique to this genus and proved applicable as target sites for oligodeoxynucleotide probes. determination of the genus specificity of the oligonucleotides was performed by whole-cell hybridization with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled probes. to this end, cells were fixed on glass slides, hybridized with the probes, and monitored by videomicroscopy. in combination with image analysis, this allowed quantification of the fluorescence per cell and objective evaluation of hybridization experiments. one of the probes developed was used to determine the population of bifidobacterium spp. in human fecal samples. a comparison was made with results obtained by cultural methods for enumeration. since both methods gave similar population estimates, it was concluded that all bifidobacteria in feces were culturable. however, since the total culturable counts were only a fraction of the total microscopic counts, the contribution of bifidobacteria to the total intestinal microflora was overestimated by almost 10-fold when cultural methods were used as the sole method for enumeration.
enhancing effect of cerebral blood volume by mild exercise in healthy young men: a near-infrared spectroscopy study this review article includes a systematic evaluation of the empirical data concerning deficits in mental ability, brain perfusion, and cerebral functioning due to chronically low blood pressure. a number of studies have provided strong evidence for reduced cognitive performance in hypotension, particularly in the domains of attention and memory. eeg studies have demonstrated that the hypotension-related poorer mental ability is also reflected in diminished cortical activity. contrary to convention, more recent research has suggested a deficient regulation of cerebral blood flow in persons with low blood pressure. in addition to reduced tonic brain perfusion, studies demonstrated insufficient adjustment of blood flow to cognitive requirements. altogether, these findings suggest that more attention should be allocated to chronic hypotension in both research and clinical practice.
word recognition and syntactic attachment in reading: evidence for a staged architecture. contrasting predictions of serial and parallel views on the processing of foveal and parafoveal information during reading were tested. a high-frequency adjective (young) was followed by either a high-frequency wordn (child) or a low-frequency wordn (tenor), which in turn was followed by either a correct (performing) or an orthographic illegal wordn + 1 (pxvforming) as a parafoveal preview. a limited parafoveal-on-foveal effect was observed: there were inflated fixation times on wordn when the preview of wordn + 1 was orthographically illegal. however, this parafoveal-on-foveal effect was (a) independent of the frequency of wordn, (b) restricted to those instances when the eyes were very close to wordn + 1, and (c) associated with relatively long prior saccades. these observations are all compatible with a mislocated fixation account in which parafoveal-on-foveal effects result from saccadic undershoots of wordn + 1 and with a serial model of eye movement control during reading.
recursive assertions are not enough - or are they? hoare-like deduction systems for establishing partial correctness of programs may fail to be complete because of (a) incompleteness of the assertion language relative to the underlying interpretation or (b) inability of the assertion language to express the invariants of loops. s. cook has shown that if there is a complete proof system for the assertion language (e.g. all true statements of the assertion language) and if the assertion language satisfies a certain natural expressibility condition, then sound and complete axiom systems for a fairly large subset of algol may be devised. we exhibit programming language constructs for which it is impossible to obtain sound and complete sets of hoare-like axioms even in this special sense of cook's. these constructs include (i) recursive procedures with procedure parameters in a programming language which uses static scope of identifiers and (ii) coroutines in a language which allows parameterless recursive procedures. modifications of these constructs for which it is possible to obtain sound and complete systems of axioms are also discussed.
decline in hiv prevalence among young women in zambia: national-level estimates of trends mask geographical and socio-demographic differences backgroundthe premise for using antenatal care (anc) clinic data for estimating hiv prevalence in the general population is the finding from community studies in sub-saharan africa that total hiv prevalence in pregnant women attending anc clinics closely approximate levels in the total general population of both women and men aged 15–49 years. in this study, the validity of national level hiv prevalence estimates for the total general population 15–49 years made from anc clinic and population survey data was assessed.methodsin 2001–2002, a national population hiv prevalence survey for women 15–49 years and men 15–59 years was conducted in zambia. in the same period, a national hiv sentinel surveillance survey among pregnant women attending anc clinics was carried out.resultsthe anc hiv prevalence estimates for age-group 15–49 years (rural: 11.5%; 95% ci, 11.2–11.8; urban: 25.4%; 95% ci, 24.8–26.0; adjusted national: 16.9%; 95% ci, 16.6–17.2) were similar to the population survey estimates (rural: 10.8%; 95% ci, 9.6–12.1; urban: 23.2%; 95% ci 20.7–25.6; national: 15.6%; 95% ci, 14.4–16.9). the hiv prevalence urban to rural ratio was 2.2 in anc and 2.1 in population survey estimates.conclusionthe hiv prevalence estimate for the total general population 15–49 years derived from testing both women and men in the population survey was similar to the estimate derived from testing women attending anc clinics. it shows that national hiv prevalence estimates for adults aged 15–49 years can also be obtained from anc hiv sentinel surveillance surveys with good coverage when anc attendance and fertility are high.
application of information extraction techniques to pharmacological domain : extracting drug-drug interactions motivation although there are several databases storing protein-protein interactions, most such data still exist only in the scientific literature. they are scattered in scientific literature written in natural languages, defying data mining efforts. much time and labor have to be spent on extracting protein pathways from literature. our aim is to develop a robust and powerful methodology to mine protein-protein interactions from biomedical texts.   results we present a novel and robust approach for extracting protein-protein interactions from literature. our method uses a dynamic programming algorithm to compute distinguishing patterns by aligning relevant sentences and key verbs that describe protein interactions. a matching algorithm is designed to extract the interactions between proteins. equipped only with a dictionary of protein names, our system achieves a recall rate of 80.0% and precision rate of 80.5%.   availability the program is available on request from the authors.
recognizing player goals in open-ended digital games with markov logic networks goal recognition for dialogue systems needs to be fast, make early predictions, and be portable. we present initial work which shows that using statistical, corpus-based methods to build goal recognizers may be a viable way to meet those needs. our goal recognizer is trained on data from apian corpus and then used to determine the agent's most likely goal based on that data. the algorithm is linear in the number of goals, and performs very well in terms of accuracy and early prediction. in addition, it is more easily portable to new domains as does not require a hand-crafted plan library.
artificial reefs for sea cucumber aquaculture confirmed as settlement substrates of the moon jellyfish aurelia coerulea jellyfish (cnidaria, scyphozoa) blooms appear to be increasing in both intensity and frequency in many coastal areas worldwide, due to multiple hypothesized anthropogenic stressors. here, we propose that the proliferation of artificial structures – associated with (1) the exponential growth in shipping, aquaculture, and other coastal industries, and (2) coastal protection (collectively, “ocean sprawl”) – provides habitat for jellyfish polyps and may be an important driver of the global increase in jellyfish blooms. however, the habitat of the benthic polyps that commonly result in coastal jellyfish blooms has remained elusive, limiting our understanding of the drivers of these blooms. support for the hypothesized role of ocean sprawl in promoting jellyfish blooms is provided by observations and experimental evidence demonstrating that jellyfish larvae settle in large numbers on artificial structures in coastal waters and develop into dense concentrations of jellyfish-producing polyps.
disc1 (disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1) is associated with cortical grey matter volumes in the human brain: a voxel-based morphometry (vbm) study. disrupted-in-schizophrenia-1 (disc1) is a promising candidate gene for schizophrenia (sz) and bipolar disorder (bp), but its basic biology remains to be elucidated. accumulating genetic evidence supports that disc1 is associated with some aspects of cognitive functions relevant to sz and bp. here, we provide a summary of the current updates in biological studies of disc1. disrupted-in-schizophrenia-1, preferentially expressed in the forebrain, has multiple isoforms with potential posttranslational modifications. disrupted-in-schizophrenia-1 protein occurs in multiple subcellular compartments, which include the centrosome, microtubule fractions, postsynaptic densities, actin cytoskeletal fractions, the mitochondria, and the nucleus. recent studies have clarified that disc1 mediates at least centrosome-dynein cascade and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp) signaling. furthermore, both cytogenetic and cell biological studies consistently suggest that an overall loss of disc1 function (either haploinsufficiency or dominant-negative, or both) may be associated with sz and bp. on the basis of these findings, production of disc1 genetically engineered mice is proposed as a promising animal model for sz and bp. several groups are currently generating disc1 mice and starting to characterize them. in this review, the advantages and disadvantages of each animal model are discussed.
pleasant for some and unpleasant for others: a protocol analysis of the cognitive factors that influence affective responses to exercise background the intensity of physical activity has been found to be inversely related to adherence, thus contributing to the problem of physical inactivity. although most physical activity is unsupervised and participants, therefore, self-select the intensity, very little is known about the level of intensity that they select. we hypothesized that participants would select, on average, an intensity proximal to the level of transition from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism.   methods twenty-three middle-aged, formerly sedentary women participated in (a) an incremental treadmill test to determine their maximal aerobic capacity and gas exchange ventilatory threshold, an index of the aerobic-anaerobic transition, and (b) a 20-min bout of treadmill exercise during which they were allowed to select the speed.   results on average, but with considerable interindividual variability, the women selected an intensity that, in terms of treadmill speed, heart rate, oxygen uptake, and perceived exertion was no different from the intensity corresponding to their gas exchange ventilatory threshold. moreover, affective valence remained positive and stable.   conclusions on average, middle-aged, formerly sedentary women selected an intensity that is considered physiologically effective and reported that it did not feel hard or unpleasant. future research should examine the sources of interindividual variability and the consequences of exercising at an intensity that exceeds one's preferred level.
clinical and molecular characterization of turkish patients with familial hypomagnesaemia: novel mutations in trpm6 and cldn16 genes. magnesium plays an essential role in many biochemical and physiological processes. homeostasis of magnesium is tightly regulated and depends on the balance between intestinal absorption and renal excretion. during the last decades, various hereditary disorders of magnesium handling have been clinically characterized and genetic studies in affected individuals have led to the identification of some molecular components of cellular magnesium transport. in addition to these hereditary forms of magnesium deficiency, recent studies have revealed a high prevalence of latent hypomagnesemia in the general population. this finding is of special interest in view of the association between hypomagnesemia and common chronic diseases such as diabetes, coronary heart disease, hypertension, and asthma. however, valuable methods for the diagnosis of body and tissue magnesium deficiency are still lacking. this review focuses on clinical and genetic aspects of hereditary disorders of magnesium homeostasis. we will review primary defects of epithelial magnesium transport, disorders associated with defects in ca2+/ mg2+ sensing, as well as diseases characterized by renal salt wasting and hypokalemic alkalosis, with special emphasis on disturbed magnesium homeostasis.
the role of n-glycosylation in folding, trafficking, and functionality of lysosomal protein cln5 neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (ncls) represent a group of children's inherited neurodegenerative disorders caused by mutations in at least eight different genes. mutations in the cln5 gene result in the finnish variant late infantile ncl characterized by gradual loss of vision, epileptic seizures, and mental deterioration. the cln5 gene encodes a lysosomal glycoprotein of unidentified function. in this study, we have used both transient and stable expression systems for the characterization of cln5, focusing on the localization, processing, and intracellular trafficking. we show that cln5 is proteolytically cleaved, and that the mature polypeptide is transported to the lysosomes. our data provide the first evidence that soluble cln5 protein can also undergo mannose‐6‐phosphate receptor‐independent trafficking to the lysosomes. we studied the localization and maturation of the cln5 carrying the previously uncharacterized vlincl disease causing mutations in hela cells. all analyzed disease mutations disturb the lysosomal trafficking of the mutated cln5 proteins. the level of lysosomal targeting does not correlate, however, to disease onset, indicating that cln5 may also function outside lysosomes. this study furthers our understanding of the basic properties of the cln5 protein, necessary for the characterization of the consequences of disease mutations and for the planning of future therapies for vlincl. hum mutat 31:356–365, 2010. © 2010 wiley‐liss, inc.
sensory versus motor loci for integration of multiple motion signals in smooth pursuit eye movements and human motion perception. how are sensory-motor transformations organized in a cortical motor system? in general, sensory information is transformed through a variety of signal processing operations in the context of distinct coordinate frameworks. we studied the interaction of two distinct operations in pursuit eye movements, learning and vector-averaging, to gain insight into their underlying coordinate frameworks and their sequence in sensory-motor processing. learning was induced in the initiation of pursuit eye movements by targets that moved initially at one speed for 100 msec and then increased or decreased to a sustained final speed. vector averaging was studied by comparing the initial eye acceleration evoked by the simultaneous motion of two targets with that evoked by each target singly. learning caused specific effects on the direction of the vector-averaged responses to two-target stimuli that included one target moving in the direction used to induce learning. learned increases or decreases in eye acceleration caused the direction of the responses to two-targets to rotate toward or away from the learning direction. learning also caused nonspecific changes in the responses to two-target stimuli. after any learning protocol, two-target responses usually became smaller, and their directions rotated away from the axis of the target motion used for learning. quantitative analysis showed that the specific effects of learning were predicted most closely by a model in which vector averaging occurs downstream from the site(s) of learning. we suggest that the pursuit system creates parallel commands for potential movements to each of the targets in two-target stimuli, and that learning occurs in the coordinates of the potential movements.
post-mortem assessment of hypoperfusion of cerebral cortex in alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. the amyloid-beta (a beta) peptide, which is derived from the amyloid precursor protein (app), is involved in the pathogenesis of alzheimer's dementia and impairs endothelium-dependent vasodilation in cerebral vessels. we investigated whether cerebrovascular autoregulation, i.e., the ability of the cerebral circulation to maintain flow in the face of changes in mean arterial pressure (map), is impaired in transgenic mice that overexpress app and a beta. neocortical cerebral blood flow (cbf) was monitored by laser-doppler flowmetry in anesthetized app(+) and app(-) mice. map was elevated by intravenous infusion of phenylephrine and reduced by controlled exsanguination. in app(-) mice, autoregulation was preserved. however, in app(+) mice, autoregulation was markedly disrupted. the magnitude of the disruption was linearly related to brain a beta concentration. the failure of autoregulation was paralleled by impairment of the cbf response to endothelium-dependent vasodilators. thus a beta disrupts a critical homeostatic mechanism of the cerebral circulation and renders cbf highly dependent on map. the resulting alterations in cerebral perfusion may play a role in the brain dysfunction and periventricular white-matter changes associated with alzheimer's dementia.
cell prestress. i. stiffness and prestress are closely associated in adherent contractile cells. we investigated the role of the integrin-associated proteins focal adhesion kinase (fak) and paxillin as mediators of mechanosensitive signal transduction in tracheal smooth muscle. in muscle strips contracted isometrically with ach, we observed higher levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of fak and paxillin at the optimal muscle length (lo) than at shorter muscle lengths of 0.5 or 0.75 lo. paxillin phosphorylation was also length sensitive in muscles activated by k+ depolarization and adjusted rapidly to changes in muscle length imposed after contractile activation by either ach or k+ depolarization. ca2+ depletion did not affect the length sensitivity of paxillin and fak phosphorylation in muscles activated with ach, indicating that the mechanotransduction process can be mediated by a ca2+-independent pathway. since ca2+-depleted muscles do not generate significant active tension, this suggests that the mechanotransduction mechanism is sensitive to muscle length rather than tension. we conclude that fak and paxillin participate in an integrin-mediated mechanotransduction process in tracheal smooth muscle. we propose that this pathway may initiate alterations in smooth muscle cell structure and contractility via the remodeling of actin filaments and/or via the mechanosensitive regulation of signaling molecules involved in contractile protein activation.
participation of children with disabilities in taiwan: the gap between independence and frequency developmental disabilities are a heterogeneous group of chronic conditions that may result in substantial activity limitations. the type and number of limitations may vary by impairment characteristics. economic and social constraints may impact activity limitations beyond those attributable to their impairment. using the international classification of functioning (icf), disability, and health conceptual framework, this study tests the hypothesis that activity limitations in young adulthood are not inevitable consequences of childhood impairment. the metropolitan atlanta developmental disabilities follow-up study of young adults, a cohort of young adults ages 21-25, is used to examine the relationship between childhood impairment and activity limitations in young adulthood. for young adults with isolated impairment, activity limitations are not probable outcomes. this situation is not the case for those with severe intellectual disability and/or multiple impairments. the type and extent of activity limitations vary by impairment characteristics. with the goal of improving and preventing activity limitations in young adults with various types and severities of childhood impairment, additional research is needed to further identify areas for secondary and tertiary prevention of the consequences of childhood impairment. the conceptual framework of the icf provides a useful tool for testing hypotheses to pinpoint areas of intervention.
utilizing ayurvedic literature for the identification of novel phytochemical inhibitors of botulinum neurotoxin a. drug discovery strategies based on natural products and traditional medicines are re-emerging as attractive options. we suggest that drug discovery and development need not always be confined to new molecular entities. rationally designed, carefully standardized, synergistic traditional herbal formulations and botanical drug products with robust scientific evidence can also be alternatives. a reverse pharmacology approach, inspired by traditional medicine and ayurveda, can offer a smart strategy for new drug candidates to facilitate discovery process and also for the development of rational synergistic botanical formulations.
an approach of top-k keyword querying for fuzzy xml keyword search enables web users to easily access xml data without the need to learn a structured query language and to study possibly complex data schemas. existing work has addressed the problem of selecting qualified data nodes that match keywords and connecting them in a meaningful way, in the spirit of inferring a where clause in xquery. however, how to infer the return clause for keyword search is an open problem.  to address this challenge, we present an xml keyword search engine, xseek, to infer the semantics of the search and identify return nodes effectively. xseek recognizes possible entities and attributes inherently represented in the data. it also distinguishes between search predicates and return specifications in the keywords. then based on the analysis of both xml data structures and keyword match patterns, xseek generates return nodes. extensive experimental studies show the effectiveness of xseek.
the prrx1 homeodomain transcription factor plays a central role in pancreatic regeneration and carcinogenesis. embryonic development of the pancreas is marked by an early phase of dramatic morphogenesis, in which pluripotent progenitor cells of the developing pancreatic epithelium give rise to the full array of mature exocrine and endocrine cell types. the genetic determinants of acinar and islet cell lineages are somewhat well defined; however, the molecular mechanisms directing ductal formation and differentiation remain to be elucidated. the complex ductal architecture of the pancreas is established by a reiterative program of progenitor cell expansion and migration known as branching morphogenesis, or tubulogenesis, which proceeds in mouse development concomitantly with peak pdx1 transcription factor expression. we therefore evaluated pdx1 expression with respect to lineage-specific markers in embryonic sections of the pancreas spanning this critical period of duct formation and discovered an unexpected population of nonislet pdx1-positive cells displaying physical traits of branching. we then established a 3d cell culture model of branching morphogenesis using primary pancreatic duct cells and identified a transient surge of pdx1 expression exclusive to branching cells. from these observations we propose that pdx1 might be involved temporally in a program of gene expression sufficient to facilitate the biochemical and morphological changes necessary for branching morphogenesis.
clinicalarticle authors bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia some macrolides have been found to exert anti-inflammatory effects. lung diseases such as asthma, panbronchiolitis, cystic fibrosis, and bronchiectasis are thought to respond to the immunomodulatory properties of macrolides. we report three cases of idiopathic bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, now called cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, and three cases of radiation-related bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia that responded to macrolide therapy. an explanation of why macrolides may have anti-inflammatory effects in patients with these syndromes is discussed. these cases help to reinforce accumulating data that macrolides are beneficial as anti-inflammatory agents and organizing pneumonia may be another pulmonary disease that can benefit from such therapy.
population connectivity shifts at high frequency within an open-coast marine protected area network for close to a century, recruitment of larvae to a local population has been widely accepted as a primary determinant of marine population dynamics. however, progress in elucidating the causes of recruitment variability has been greatly impeded by our ignorance of the sources of recruits. although it is often assumed that recruitment is independent of local reproduction, there is increasing circumstantial evidence that physical and behavioural mechanisms could facilitate larval retention near source populations. to develop a direct method for reconstructing the dispersal history of recruiting larvae, we put forward the hypothesis that differences in nutrient and trace-element concentrations between coastal and open oceans could result in quantifiable differences in growth rate and elemental composition between larvae developing in coastal waters (locally retained) and larvae developing in open ocean waters (produced in distant locations). using this method, we show that recruitment to an island population of a widely distributed coral-reef fish may often result from local retention on leeward reefs. this result has implications for fisheries management and marine reserve design, because rates of dispersal between marine populations—and thus recruitment to exploited populations—could be much lower than currently assumed.
the pocket-4-life project, bioavailability and beneficial properties of the bioactive compounds of espresso coffee and cocoa-based confectionery containing coffee: study protocol for a randomized cross-over trial human intervention trials have provided evidence for protective effects of various (poly)phenol-rich foods against chronic disease, including cardiovascular disease, neurodegeneration, and cancer. while there are considerable data suggesting benefits of (poly)phenol intake, conclusions regarding their preventive potential remain unresolved due to several limitations in existing studies. bioactivity investigations using cell lines have made an extensive use of both (poly)phenolic aglycones and sugar conjugates, these being the typical forms that exist in planta, at concentrations in the low-μm-to-mm range. however, after ingestion, dietary (poly)phenolics appear in the circulatory system not as the parent compounds, but as phase ii metabolites, and their presence in plasma after dietary intake rarely exceeds nm concentrations. substantial quantities of both the parent compounds and their metabolites pass to the colon where they are degraded by the action of the local microbiota, giving rise principally to small phenolic acid and aromatic catabolites that are absorbed into the circulatory system. this comprehensive review describes the different groups of compounds that have been reported to be involved in human nutrition, their fate in the body as they pass through the gastrointestinal tract and are absorbed into the circulatory system, the evidence of their impact on human chronic diseases, and the possible mechanisms of action through which (poly)phenol metabolites and catabolites may exert these protective actions. it is concluded that better performed in vivo intervention and in vitro mechanistic studies are needed to fully understand how these molecules interact with human physiological and pathological processes.
mitotic centromere‐associated kinase (mcak/kif2c) regulates cellular senescence in human primary cells through a p53‐dependent pathway cellular senescence is a proliferation arrest that is typically irreversible and caused by various cellular stresses, including excess rounds of cell division and cancer-causing genetic alterations. senescence actively contributes to a tissue-level response to tissue wounding and incipient cancer, healing the tissue and suppressing tumor formation. however, in the long term, the same senescence program may hurt the tissue, thereby contributing to tissue aging. tumor suppression, wound healing, and aging are each associated with inflammation, and here it is proposed that cellular senescence contributes to a "nonimmune cell" component of the tissue inflammatory response.
nighttime ambulatory blood pressure is associated with atrial remodelling and neurohormonal activation in patients with idiopathic atrial fibrillation. abstract—incidence, determinants, and outcome of atrial fibrillation in hypertensive subjects are incompletely known. we followed for up to 16 years 2482 initially untreated subjects with essential hypertension. at entry, all subjects were in sinus rhythm. subjects with valvular heart disease, coronary artery disease, preexcitation syndrome, thyroid disorders, or lung disease were excluded. during follow-up, a first episode of atrial fibrillation occurred in 61 subjects at a rate of 0.46 per 100 person-years. at entry, subjects with future atrial fibrillation differed (all p <0.05) from those without by age (59 versus 51 years), office, and 24-hour systolic blood pressure (165 and 144 versus 157 and 137 mm hg, respectively), left ventricular mass (58 versus 49 g/height[m]2.7), and left atrial diameter (3.89 versus 3.56 cm). age and left ventricular mass (both p <0.001) were the sole independent predictors of atrial fibrillation. for every 1 standard deviation increase in left ventricular mass, the risk of atrial fibrillation was increased 1.20 times (95% ci, 1.07 to 1.34). atrial fibrillation became chronic in 33% of subjects. age, left ventricular mass, and left atrial diameter (all p <0.01) were independent predictors of chronic atrial fibrillation. ischemic stroke occurred at a rate of 2.7% and 4.6% per year, respectively, among subjects with paroxysmal and chronic atrial fibrillation. these data indicate that in hypertensive subjects with sinus rhythm and no other major predisposing conditions, risk of atrial fibrillation increases with age and left ventricular mass. increased left atrial size predisposes to chronicization of atrial fibrillation.
audio–vocal system regulation in children with autism spectrum disorders asperger syndrome (as), belonging to the autism spectrum of disorders, is one of the pervasive developmental disorders. individuals with as usually have normal development of formal speech but pronounced problems in perceiving and producing speech prosody. the present study addressed the discrimination of speech prosody in as by recording the mismatch negativity (mmn) and behavioural responses to natural utterances with different emotional connotations. mmn responses were abnormal in the adults with as in several ways. in these subjects, fewer significantly elicited mmns, diminished mmn amplitudes, as well as prolonged latencies were found. in addition, the mmn generator loci differed between the subjects with as and control subjects. these findings were predominant over the right cerebral hemisphere. these results show impaired neurobiological basis for speech-prosody processing at an early, pre-attentive auditory discrimination stage in as.
lack of an adverse effect of giardia intestinalis infection on the health of peruvian children. in a peri-urban shanty town in lima, peru, that was hyperendemic for giardia lamblia, 44 children aged between 0.9 months and 10 years were effectively treated for giardia lamblia with tinidazole. stools were examined weekly in the 6 months after treatment to determine the rate of reinfection, and after reinfection stools continued to be examined. 98% of the children became reinfected with giardia lamblia within 6 months, and after reinfection stool excretion of the parasite lasted a mean (sd) of 3.2 (3.3) months. the children's mean stool ph and their mean stool fat index was unaffected by giardia lamblia reinfection. treatment of all symptomless giardia lamblia infections in a developing country hyperendemic for the disease is of questionable value because of rapid reinfection.
identification of candidate targeted genes in molecular subtypes of gastric cancer insulin gene enhancer binding protein-1 (isl-1) is a transcription factor involved in development of the heart, motor neurons, and pancreas. our previous study indicated that isl-1 was overexpressed in gastric cancer but not in other gastrointestinal tumors. however, no immunohistochemical or clinicopathological studies of isl-1 in gastric carcinoma have been performed. the aim of this study was to determine the expression and prognostic value of isl-1 in gastric carcinoma. a nude mouse xenograft model was established to study the role of isl-1 on cancer genesis and development in vivo. overexpression of isl-1 significantly enhanced the tumorigenicity of nih3t3 cells in vivo. isl-1 expression was evaluated using immunohistochemistry in 456 human gastric carcinoma and normal tissues. isl-1 was significantly overexpressed in gastric adenocarcinoma compared with normal gastric tissues. isl-1 expression was significantly associated with depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis, tnm stage, and histological grade (p < .05, χ(2) test). positive isl-1 expression was associated with poorer 5-year overall survival in gastric cancer (p = .001, log-rank test). multivariate cox regression analysis demonstrated that isl-1 expression (p = .047) could be an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in gastric carcinoma. this study suggests that isl-1 may be a useful prognostic biomarker and may represent a novel therapeutic target for gastric adenocarcinoma.
nfκb mediated elevation of kcnj11 promotes tumor progression of hepatocellular carcinoma through interaction of lactate dehydrogenase a. ion channels have emerged as regulators of developmental processes. in model organisms and in people with mutations in ion channels, disruption of ion channel function can affect cell proliferation, cell migration, and craniofacial and limb patterning. alterations of ion channel function affect morphogenesis in fish, frogs, mammals, and flies, demonstrating that ion channels have conserved roles in developmental processes. one model suggests that ion channels affect proliferation and migration through changes in cell volume. however, ion channels have not explicitly been placed in canonical developmental signaling cascades until recently. this review gives examples of ion channels that influence developmental processes, offers a potential underlying molecular mechanism involving bone morphogenetic protein (bmp) signaling, and finally explores exciting possibilities for manipulating ion channels to influence cell fate for regenerative medicine and to impact disease.
prediction of ovarian cancer prognosis and response to chemotherapy by a serum-based multiparametric biomarker panel epithelial ovarian cancer constitutes one-quarter of the gynecologic malignancies, but is the leading cause of death among women with gynecologic cancer. in 6070% of the women, the disease is detected at a late stage when 5-year survival is poor. the recommended primary therapeutic approach for ovarian cancer is aggressive primarydebulking surgery followed by combination chemotherapy. the efficacy is routinely evaluated by repeated vaginal examination and transabdominal ultrasonography. however, these methods are unreliable for monitoring as progressive and recurrent disease often remains hidden until the patient presents with a large tumor mass. over the last few decades a variety of serological tumor markers has been proposed as a supplement to other non-invasive diagnostic methods. the main issue with tumor marker measurements is to obtain reliable information about changes in tumor mass before the changes are detectable by other methods. however, despite several attempts to identify useful serological markers for epithelial ovarian cancer, the results have not been as encouraging as for germ-cell tumors. the purpose of this paper is to review the applicability of ca 125, cea, tpa, tati, casa, and tetranectin in screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of ovarian carcinoma. several compounds other than those mentioned above are being investigated as markers in the early detection and management of ovarian cancer. some ofthese potential tumor markers listed in table 1 will not be discussed further in this review.
ab initio density functional studies of the restructuring of graphene nanoribbons to form tailored single walled carbon nanotubes we demonstrate a new method (u.s. patent appl., serial no. 60/908039) for synthesizing carbon nanotubes (cnts), using first-principles and classical molecular dynamics simulations. the single-walled nanotubes (swnts) are formed by folding graphene nanoribbons patterned on graphite films through adsorption of atoms of varying coverage, which introduces an external stress to drive the folding process. the diameter and chirality of swnts can be a priori controlled by patterning graphene nanoribbons with predefined width and direction so that the postsynthesis sorting process is eliminated. our method allows potentially mass production of identical tubes and easy integration into device structures on a substrate.

neuronal α-bungarotoxin receptors are α7 subunit homomers it has recently been demonstrated that alpha-bungarotoxin receptors, which behave as functional nicotinic receptors, are present in chick cns. in this paper, we report the purification and characterization of a functional alpha-bungarotoxin receptor from chick cerebellum, a nervous tissue in which a clear inhibition of induced nicotine effects has been reported in vivo. this receptor contains at least three subunits of apparent mol. wt 52,000, 57,000 and 67,000. the use of monoclonal antibodies specific for the alpha 7 subunit demonstrated that 75% of the molecules present in our purified preparation belong to the alpha 7 subtype and that this antibody labels the 57,000 band in western blot, thus indicating that this is the toxin binding subunit. reconstruction experiments in planar lipid bilayers show that this alpha-bungarotoxin receptor forms a cation selective channel whose opening is blocked by d-tubocurarine. binding experiments on immobilized receptors over an alpha-bungarotoxin-sepharose affinity column show that the ligand binding subunit is present in vivo in two copies per receptor. immunological, pharmacological and functional experiments show that this purified receptor is very similar, but not identical, to the previously characterized chick optic lobe receptor, thus indicating the heterogeneity of these alpha-bungarotoxin receptors in the cns.
0 time-varying discrete-time wavelet transforms time-varying filter banks and wavelets are studied and a design procedure is presented. in the resulting analysis-synthesis structures, the analysis filters and the corresponding synthesis filters, the number of bands, and the decimation rates can be changed with time. such structures can be considered as time-frequency overlapping block transforms. from this viewpoint, the tiling of the time-frequency plane and the corresponding basis functions are changed in time. the time-varying discrete wavelet transforms can be considered a special case of time-varying overlapping block transforms and are studied in detail. the formulation is based on the time domain formulation of time-varying analysis-synthesis structures. the design procedure can be used to design time-varying perfectly invertible transformations with a finite number of distinct analysis structures. for adaptive filter bank application, a least squares design method is also studied. >
bioinformatic approaches to interrogating vitamin d receptor signaling the current study aimed to assess the topology of the nuclear receptor (nr) superfamily in normal prostate epithelial cells and its distortion in prostate cancer. both in vitro and in silico approaches were utilized to profile nrs expressed in non-malignant rwpe-1 cells, which were subsequently investigated by treating cells with 132 binary nr ligand combinations. nine significant cooperative interactions emerged including both superadditive [22(r)-hydroxycholesterol and eicosatetraenoic acid] and subadditive [1α,25(oh)2d3 and chenodeoxycholic acid] cellular responses, which could be explained in part by cooperative control of cell-cycle progression and candidate gene expression. in addition, publicly available data were employed to assess nr expression in human prostate tissue. common and significant loss of nr superfamily expression was established in publicly available data from prostate tumors, in part predicting parallel distortion of targeting microrna. these findings suggest that the nr superfamily in the prostate cooperatively integrates signals from dietary, hormonal and metabolic cues, and is significantly distorted in prostate cancer.
signal transduction in smooth muscle selected contribution : time course and heterogeneity of contractile responses in cultured human airway smooth muscle cells adherens junctions in isolated avian gizzard smooth muscle cells appear as short longitudinal streaks or chevrons that are arranged in periodic, mainly transverse bands along the cell surface. this barrel-like geometry, revealed by antibodies to either vinculin or talin, was seen also in teased gizzard strips by confocal laser-scanning microscopy and contrasted with the rib-like surface pattern observed here and previously in other avian and mammalian smooth muscles. there were on average 67 transverse bands per gizzard cell and an estimated total of around 800 vinculin/talin sites. the longitudinal spacing between the transverse bands of vinculin streaks in the gizzard cells changed from 4-5 microns in extended cells to around 1 micron in shortened cells and the bands remained essentially transverse at all cell lengths, inconsistent with a screw-like mode of cell shortening as has been invoked for smooth muscle cells by others. the absence of rotation on shortening was confirmed by observations on isolated and bead-decorated skinned cells that were induced to contract with atp. counterlabelling of cells with alpha-actinin antibodies produced more or less exclusive staining of the cytoplasmic dense bodies, and little surface label: the total number of dense bodies per cell, estimated from confocal microscope through focal series was in the range of 3000. the data are consistent with a periodic anchorage of actin filaments to the cell surface and, in turn, with the existence of regularly spaced contractile assemblies.
epidermoid cysts of the cerebellopontine angle with extension into the middle and anterior cranial fossae: surgical strategy and review of the literature objective epidermoid tumors have similar radiologic characteristics with arachnoid cysts on routine imaging techniques. since they warrant different therapeutic interventions, it is essential to differentiate the two pathologies and to assess operative results.   purpose the purpose of this study is to define the mr characteristics of epidermoid tumors in posterior fossa particularly on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (flair) and diffusion-weighted imaging (dwi).   patients and methods during a 10-year period, we operated 19 cases with epidermoid tumor of posterior fossa. the localization of the epidermoids was cerebellopontine angle in 16 patients, within the fourth ventricle in 2 patients and pineal region in 1 patient. neuroimaging included ct in all patients, conventional mr in 14 patients and flair and dwi in the last 6 patients.   results in the first 13 cases, diagnosis of epidermoid tumor was difficult on ct and conventional mr. epidermoids appeared as heterogeneous hyperintense lesions on flair and homogenous hyperintense lesions on dwi in the last 6 patients. while total resection of the tumor was achieved in 17 patients, subtotal resection was performed in 2 patients. histopathological examinations of the specimens revealed epidermoid tumor in all cases.   conclusion advances in neuroradiology provide us advantages for planning the treatment modalities in epidermoid tumors of the posterior fossa. the difficulties in preoperative differential diagnosis and judgment for reoperation in the postoperative course have been decreased particularly via flair and dwi.
unsupervised detection of opium poppy fields in afghanistan from e0-1 hyperion data principal component analysis (pca) is one of the most commonly adopted feature reduction techniques in remote sensing image analysis. however, it may overlook subtle but useful information if applied directly to the analysis of hyperspectral data, especially for discriminating between different vegetation types. in order to accurately map an invasive plant species (horse tamarind, leucaena leucocephala) in southern taiwan using hyperion hyperspectral imagery, this study developed a spectrally segmented pca based on the spectral characteristics of vegetation over different wavelength regions. the developed algorithm can not only reduce the dimensionality of hyperspectral imagery but also extracts helpful information for differentiating more effectively the target plant species from other vegetation types. experiments conducted in this study demonstrated that the developed algorithm performs better than correlation‐based segmented principal component transformation (spct) and conventional pca (overall accuracy: 86%, 76%, 66%; kappa value: 0.81, 0.69, 0.57) in detecting the target plant species, as well as mapping other vegetation covers.
epidemiology of leptospirosis in africa: a systematic review of a neglected zoonosis and a paradigm for ‘one health’ in africa leptospirosis is a widespread but under-reported cause of morbidity and mortality. global re-emergence of leptospirosis has been associated with the growth of informal urban settlements in which rodents are thought to be important reservoir hosts. understanding the multi-host epidemiology of leptospirosis is essential to control and prevent disease. a cross-sectional survey of rodents in the kibera settlement in nairobi, kenya was conducted in september–october 2008 to demonstrate the presence of pathogenic leptospires. a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed that 41 (18.3%) of 224 rodents carried pathogenic leptospires in their kidneys, and sequence data identified leptospira interrogans and l. kirschneri in this population. rodents of the genus mus (37 of 185) were significantly more likely to be positive than those of the genus rattus (4 of 39; odds ratio = 15.03). questionnaire data showed frequent contact between humans and rodents in kibera. this study emphasizes the need to quantify the public health impacts of this neglected disease at this and other urban sites in africa.
recovering missing labels of crowdsourcing workers we consider the general problem of learning from labeled and unlabeled data, which is often called semi-supervised learning or transductive inference. a principled approach to semi-supervised learning is to design a classifying function which is sufficiently smooth with respect to the intrinsic structure collectively revealed by known labeled and unlabeled points. we present a simple algorithm to obtain such a smooth solution. our method yields encouraging experimental results on a number of classification problems and demonstrates effective use of unlabeled data.
profinite semigroups and applications — in recent years, considérable attention has been given to the famüy of aperiqdic languages, also known as star-free languages and noncounting regular languages. several interesting subfamilies of aperiodic languages have been studied and characterized by the properties of the corresponding syntactic semigroups. the study of such families has been systematized by examining the position of each family in certain natural hiérarchies. this paper gives a brief survey of results in this area.
endotoxin-induced inflammation suppresses the effect of melatonin on the release of lh from the ovine pars tuberalis explants—ex vivo study there is no information in the literature regarding the effect of corticotropin-releasing hormone (crh) on genes encoding gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (gnrh) and the gnrh receptor (gnrhr) in the hypothalamus or on gnrhr gene expression in the pituitary gland in vivo. thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate, in follicular phase ewes, the effects of prolonged, intermittent infusion of small doses of crh or its antagonist (α-helical crh 9-41; crh-a) into the third cerebral ventricle on gnrh mrna and gnrhr mrna levels in the hypothalamo-pituitary unit and on lh secretion. stimulation or inhibition of crh receptors significantly decreased or increased gnrh gene expression in the hypothalamus, respectively, and led to different responses in gnrhr gene expression in discrete hypothalamic areas. for example, crh increased gnrhr gene expression in the preoptic area, but decreased it in the hypothalamus/stalk median eminence and in the anterior pituitary gland. in addition, crh decreased lh secretion. blockade of crh receptors had the opposite effect on gnrhr gene expression. the results suggest that activation of crh receptors in the hypothalamus of follicular phase ewes can modulate the biosynthesis and release of gnrh through complex changes in the expression of gnrh and gnrhr genes in the hypothalamo-anterior pituitary unit.
type ii secretion substrates of legionella pneumophila translocate out of the pathogen-occupied vacuole via a semipermeable membrane legionella pneumophila is a bacterial pathogen of amoebae and humans. intracellular growth requires a type ivb secretion system that translocates at least 200 different proteins into host cells. to distinguish between proteins necessary for growth in culture and those specifically required for intracellular replication, a screen was performed to identify genes necessary for optimal growth in nutrient-rich medium. mapping of these genes revealed that the l. pneumophila chromosome has a modular architecture consisting of several large genomic islands that are dispensable for growth in bacteriological culture. strains lacking six of these regions, and thus 18.5% of the genome, were viable but required secondary point mutations for optimal growth. the simultaneous deletion of five of these genomic loci had no adverse effect on growth of the bacterium in nutrient-rich media. remarkably, this minimal genome strain, which lacked 31% of the known substrates of the type ivb system, caused only marginal defects in intracellular growth within mouse macrophages. in contrast, deletion of single regions reduced growth within amoebae. the importance of individual islands, however, differed among amoebal species. the host-specific requirements of these genomic islands support a model in which the acquisition of foreign dna has broadened the l. pneumophila host range.
topological relations between random areal objects within gis this paper presents a model for describing the positional error of line segments in geographical information systems (gis). the model is based on stochastic process theory with the assumptions that the errors of the endpoints of a line segment follow two-dimensional normal distributions. the distribution and density functions of the line segments are derived statistically. the uncertainty information matrix of line segments is derived to indicate the error of an arbitrary point on the line segment. this model covers the cases where two-end points are correlated to each other and points on the line segment are stochastically continuous to each other. the model is a more generic error band model than those previously developed and is called the g-band model.
spatiotemporal expression of notch receptors and ligands in developing mouse placenta. involvement of the notch signaling pathway in vascular development has been demonstrated by both gain- and loss-of-function mutations in humans, mice, and zebrafish. in zebrafish, notch signaling is required for arterial identity by suppressing the venous fate in developing artery cells. in mice, the notch4 receptor and the delta-like 4 (dll4) ligand are specifically expressed in arterial endothelial cells, suggesting a similar role. here we show that the dll4 ligand alone is required in a dosage-sensitive manner for normal arterial patterning in development. this implicates dll4 as the specific mammalian endothelial ligand for autocrine endothelial notch signaling, and suggests that dll4 may be a suitable target for intervention in arterial angiogenesis.
novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of candida infections: the potential of immunotherapy. background nosocomial bloodstream infections (bsis) are important causes of morbidity and mortality in the united states.   methods data from a nationwide, concurrent surveillance study (surveillance and control of pathogens of epidemiological importance [scope]) were used to examine the secular trends in the epidemiology and microbiology of nosocomial bsis.   results our study detected 24,179 cases of nosocomial bsi in 49 us hospitals over a 7-year period from march 1995 through september 2002 (60 cases per 10,000 hospital admissions). eighty-seven percent of bsis were monomicrobial. gram-positive organisms caused 65% of these bsis, gram-negative organisms caused 25%, and fungi caused 9.5%. the crude mortality rate was 27%. the most-common organisms causing bsis were coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (31% of isolates), staphylococcus aureus (20%), enterococci (9%), and candida species (9%). the mean interval between admission and infection was 13 days for infection with escherichia coli, 16 days for s. aureus, 22 days for candida species and klebsiella species, 23 days for enterococci, and 26 days for acinetobacter species. cons, pseudomonas species, enterobacter species, serratia species, and acinetobacter species were more likely to cause infections in patients in intensive care units (p<.001). in neutropenic patients, infections with candida species, enterococci, and viridans group streptococci were significantly more common. the proportion of s. aureus isolates with methicillin resistance increased from 22% in 1995 to 57% in 2001 (p<.001, trend analysis). vancomycin resistance was seen in 2% of enterococcus faecalis isolates and in 60% of enterococcus faecium isolates.   conclusion in this study, one of the largest multicenter studies performed to date, we found that the proportion of nosocomial bsis due to antibiotic-resistant organisms is increasing in us hospitals.

nevus comedonicus: a case series abstract: we report extensive nevus comedonicus in a female patient that involved half of her body entirely, with infected cystic lesions as well as typical scars, limited by the midline. the lesions worsened at the beginning of puberty. a brief review of the literature highlights the histopathologic, etiopathogenic, and therapeutic aspects.
distal radius fractures result in alterations in scapular kinematics: a three-dimensional motion analysis. the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that shoulder rhythm is affected by rotator cuff pathology during arm elevation. we divided 42 subjects into 3 groups: those with full-thickness rotator cuff tears (rcts) (n = 14), those with tendinopathy (n = 13), and control subjects (n = 15). shoulder kinematics was recorded while subjects performed elevation in the sagittal and scapular planes. euler angles were computed for scapular and humeral elevation. data were divided into 3 equal phases. lines were fit and the slope determined for each phase. significant differences in slopes ( p < .05) were found between experimental groups for both motions. the rct group had higher slopes in the initial and middle phases for sagittal elevation and in the middle phase for scapular abduction. the scapula was elevated more in the rct group in the initial two thirds of movement. this motion may change the length of remaining muscles so that they operate on a more effective part of their length-tension curve.
overexpression of cyclins d1 and d3 during estrogen-induced breast oncogenesis in female aci rats. the cell cycle regulatory gene cyclin d1 is a candidate oncogene in breast cancer. it is overexpressed in 30-50% of invasive primary breast cancers and plays a key role in mediating mitogenic responses to steroids and growth factors in breast cancer cells in vitro. because the role of cyclin d1 in the proliferative and early noninvasive stages of breast cancer is largely unknown, we examined normal breast epithelium (nbe), proliferative disease (pd), ductal carcinoma in situ (dcis), and invasive carcinoma (ic) to evaluate the timing and possible importance of cyclin d1 expression in the development of breast cancer. using immunohistochemistry, we examined cyclin d1 protein expression in 471 breast tissue samples. a quantitative scoring system for immunohistochemistry based on percentage of positive cells was developed that correlated with western blot analysis of antigen concentration in paired samples (r2 = 0.91, p = 0.003). a sample was considered positive if >5% of relevant epithelial cells demonstrated nuclear staining. cyclin d1 positivity was observed in 11.7% (7 of 60) samples of nbe, 25% (11 of 44) of pd without atypia, 39.4% (13 of 33) of atypical ductal hyperplasia, 43.6% (17 of 39) of low-grade dcis, 47.9% (23 of 48) of high-grade dcis, and 48.3% (99 of 205) of ic. cyclin d1 expression was significantly higher in pd than nbe (p = 0.006) and in dcis than pd (p = 0.038). there was no significant increase from dcis to ic (p = 0.52). the increase in cyclin d1 expression in the overall progression from nbe to ic was also highly significant (p = 0.0001). therefore, cyclin d1 expression was detected at levels significantly greater than in nbe in the earliest proliferative epithelial lesions of the breast with a further significant increase accompanying the progression to any form of cancer. this suggests that overexpression of cyclin d1 protein is important at the earliest stages of breast oncogenesis and continues to have a crucial role throughout the development of malignancy.
convex optimization and utility theory, new trends in vlsi circuit layout the "quadratic placement" methodology is rooted in [module placement based on resistive network optimization, proud: a sea-of-gate placement algorithm, a combined force and cut algorithm for hierarchical vlsi layout]and is reputedly used in many commercial and in-house tools forplacement of standard-cell and gate-array designs. the methodologyiterates between two basic steps: solving sparse systems oflinear equations, and repartitioning. this work dissects the implementationand motivations for quadratic placement. we firstshow that (i) krylov subspace engines for solving sparse systemsof linear equations are more effective than the traditional successiveover-relaxation (sor) engine [a unified approach to partitioning and placement] and (ii) order convergence criteriacan maintain solution quality while using substantially fewersolver iterations. we then discuss the motivations and relevanceof the quadratic placement approach, in the context of past and futurealgorithmic technology, performance requirements, and designmethodology. we provide evidence that the use of numerical linearsystems solvers with quadratic wirelength objective may be due tothe pre-1990's weakness of min-cut partitioners, i.e., numerical engineswere needed to provide helpful hints to min-cut partitioners.finally, we note emerging methodology drivers in deep-submicrondesign that may require new placement approaches to the placement problem.
referential choices in a collaborative storytelling task: discourse stages and referential complexity matter in this study, children, young adults and elderly adults were tested in production and comprehension tasks assessing referential choice. our aims were (1) to determine whether speakers egocentrically base their referential choice on the preceding linguistic discourse or also take into account the perspective of a hypothetical listener and (2) whether the possible impact of perspective taking on referential choice changes with increasing age, with its associated changes in cognitive capacity. in the production task, participants described picture-based stories featuring two characters of the same gender, making it necessary to use unambiguous forms; in the comprehension task, participants interpreted potentially ambiguous pronouns at the end of similar orally presented stories. young adults (aged 18–35) were highly sensitive to the informational needs of hypothetical conversational partners in their production and comprehension of referring expressions. in contrast, children (aged 4–7) did not take into account possible conversational partners and tended to use pronouns for all given referents, leading to the production of ambiguous pronouns that are unrecoverable for a listener. this was mirrored in the outcome of the comprehension task, where children were insensitive to the shift of discourse topic marked by the speaker. the elderly adults (aged 69–87) behaved differently from both young adults and children. they showed a clear sensitivity to the other person's perspective in both production and comprehension, but appeared to lack the necessary cognitive capacities to keep track of the prominence of discourse referents, producing more potentially ambiguous pronouns than young adults, though fewer than children. in conclusion then, referential choice seems to depend on perspective taking in language, which develops with increasing linguistic experience and cognitive capacity, but also on the ability to keep track of the prominence of discourse referents, which is gradually lost with older age.
phylogeography, historical demography, and genetic structure of the rose bitterling, rhodeus ocellatus (kner, 1866) (cypriniformes: acheilognathidae), in east asia. [1] a new regional compilation of the drainage history in southeastern tibet suggests that the modern rivers draining the plateau margin were once tributaries to a single, southward flowing system which drained into the south china sea. disruption of the paleo-drainage occurred by river capture and reversal prior to or coeval with the initiation of miocene (?) uplift in eastern tibet, including ∼2000 m of surface uplift of the lower plateau margin since reversal of the flow direction of the yangtze river. despite lateral changes in course due to capture and reversal, the superposition of eastward and southward draining rivers that cross the southeastern plateau margin suggests that uplift has occurred over long wavelengths (>1000 km), mimicking the present low-gradient topographic slope. thus reorganization of drainage lines by capture and reversal events explains most of the peculiar patterns of the eastern plateau rivers, without having to appeal to large-magnitude tectonic shear.
studying work practices: a key factor in understanding accidents on the level triggered by a balance disturbance the vast majority of the published workplace slips, trips and falls (stf) literature is exceedingly narrow in its focus and often ignores wider systems issues in workplace stf aetiology. there is little recognition within the published literature of the importance of latent failures or the upstream organisational and cultural contexts within which workplace stf occur. this is unfortunate, as a systems approach to workplace stf analysis, that is inclusive of latent design and work organisation factors that often shape worker behaviour patterns related to stf risk (e.g. rushing, risk taking), is fundamental to the development of effective prevention measures. the aims of this paper are to provide an understanding of workplace stf causation that is cognisant of the potential role of both active and latent failures in stf causation. the paper presents an ergonomics model for workplace stf analysis that highlights information processing in stf aetiology, the stf incident process and the interaction between latent and active failures in stf causation. the paper draws upon ergonomics research conducted in a range of occupational contexts to illustrate the key features of the model as it applies to workplace stf. implications of the model for analysis and prevention of stf are discussed.
relationship between clinical and surgical findings and reparability of large and massive rotator cuff tears: a longitudinal study "cover the hole in the cuff." echoes from the past and voices from the present blend to give us the same message. the message is firm and authoritative, almost mesmerizing, yet almost unchanged since the time the edict was first issued by codman (1) almost 60 years ago. we all understand the concept of rotator cuff repair. it makes sense to repair a torn rotator cuff to its anatomic location. we restore the anatomy and hence restore the mechanics of the cuff. however, when faced with a massive tear that cannot be completely repaired, most orthopedic surgeons continue to be swayed by that ancient irresistible siren song of "cover the hole." a number of clever techniques have been used to cover the hole, including supraspinatus muscle slide (2), fascial graft (3), freeze-dried allograft (4), and tendon transposition (5,6). however, most of these techniques either ignore or openly violate the mechanics of the shoulder. a major purpose of this article is to encourage us as orthopedic surgeons to consider the multidisciplinary dimensions of a biologic problem: too often we seek biologic solutions to mechanical problems. for years, engineers have used professional horizontal cross-integration on major projects by employing experts from diverse fields to approach complex engineering problems. this allows the engineering team to evaluate a problem from a number of different perspectives. this approach reduces the possibility of overlooking some critically important
bar-sh3 sorting nexins are conserved interacting proteins of nervous wreck that organize synapses and promote neurotransmission in drosophila, the larval neuromuscular junction is particularly tractable for studying how synapses develop and function. in contrast to vertebrate central synapses, each presynaptic motor neuron and postsynaptic muscle cell is unique and identifiable, and the wiring circuit is invariant. thus, the full power of drosophila genetics can be brought to bear on a single, reproducibly identifiable, synaptic terminal. each individual neuromuscular junction encompasses hundreds of synaptic neurotransmitter release sites housed in a chain of synaptic boutons. recent advances have increased our understanding of the mechanisms that shape the development of both individual synapses--that is, the transmitter release sites including active zones and their apposed glutamate receptor clusters--and the whole synaptic terminal that connects a pre- and post-synaptic cell.
connexin 43 deficiency accelerates skin wound healing and extracellular matrix remodeling in mice. background: expression of connexins and other constituent proteins of gap junctions along with gap junctional intercellular communication are involved in cellular development and differentiation processes. in addition, an increasing number of hereditary skin disorders appear to be linked to connexins. therefore, in this report, the authors studied in vitro gap junctional intercellular communication function and connexin expression in fibroblasts derived from keloid and hypertrophic scar patients. methods: fibroblasts harvested from each of six keloid and hypertrophic scar patients were used for this study. gap junctional intercellular communication function was investigated using the gap fluorescence recovery after photobleaching method, and expression of connexin proteins was studied using quantitative confocal microscopic analyses. results: compared with normal skin, a decreased level of gap junctional intercellular communication was seen in fibroblasts derived from hypertrophic scar tissue, whereas an extremely low gap junctional intercellular communication level was detected in fibroblasts derived from keloid tissue. we also detected little connexin 43 (cx43) protein localized in fibroblasts derived from keloids. moreover, cx43 protein levels were much lower in fibroblasts derived from hypertrophic scars than in those derived from normal skin. conclusions: the authors' data suggest that the loss of gap junctional intercellular communication and connexin expression may affect intercellular recognition and thus break the proliferation and apoptosis balance in fibroblasts derived from keloid and hypertrophic scar tissue.
cloning and bacterial expression of hemagglutinin antigen stem of h9n2 avian influenza virus wild aquatic bird populations have long been considered the natural reservoir for influenza a viruses with virus transmission from these birds seeding other avian and mammalian hosts. while most evidence still supports this dogma, recent studies in bats have suggested other reservoir species may also exist. extensive surveillance studies coupled with an enhanced awareness in response to h5n1 and pandemic 2009 h1n1 outbreaks is also revealing a growing list of animals susceptible to infection with influenza a viruses. although in a relatively stable host-pathogen interaction in aquatic birds, antigenic, and genetic evolution of influenza a viruses often accompanies interspecies transmission as the virus adapts to a new host. the evolutionary changes in the new hosts result from a number of processes including mutation, reassortment, and recombination. depending on host and virus these changes can be accompanied by disease outbreaks impacting wildlife, veterinary, and public health.
enhancing effect of cerebral blood volume by mild exercise in healthy young men: a near-infrared spectroscopy study this review article includes a systematic evaluation of the empirical data concerning deficits in mental ability, brain perfusion, and cerebral functioning due to chronically low blood pressure. a number of studies have provided strong evidence for reduced cognitive performance in hypotension, particularly in the domains of attention and memory. eeg studies have demonstrated that the hypotension-related poorer mental ability is also reflected in diminished cortical activity. contrary to convention, more recent research has suggested a deficient regulation of cerebral blood flow in persons with low blood pressure. in addition to reduced tonic brain perfusion, studies demonstrated insufficient adjustment of blood flow to cognitive requirements. altogether, these findings suggest that more attention should be allocated to chronic hypotension in both research and clinical practice.
in praise of impredicativity: a contribution to the formalisation of meta-programming we describe a fragment of higher-order horn logic which can be used as a higher-order extension of prolog. it allows the programmer to axiomatize predicates of predicates and operations on predicates. the restrictions defining the fragment ensure that the higher-order predicates and operations defined are monotonic and continuous—that they are enumeration operators. as a result, the fragment is well behaved both denotationally and operationally. denotationally, the meaning of a program is its minimal herbrand model, using standard extensional higher-order model theory. operationally, it can still be implemented efficiently with standard techniques, using an adapted resolution theorem prover. the fragment is in fact (almost) a subset of hilog—a “pure” subset with simple semantics and a straightforward implementation.
chemobrain experienced by breast cancer survivors: a meta-ethnography study investigating research and care implications aims and objectives to investigate women's awareness of chemotherapy-induced cognitive changes, their perception of cognitive limitations in carrying out daily tasks and subsequent return to work decisions and perceptions of work ability.   background evidence suggests that women diagnosed with breast cancer experience cognitive changes as a consequence of chemotherapy treatment. although these changes tend to be subtle deficits in memory, concentration and the ability to organise information, there has been no published research identifying how they can impact patient's ability to work and subsequent employment decisions.   design this was a qualitative study.   method data were collected from breast cancer survivors using semi-structured interviews with two focus groups (n = 6, n = 7). interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using template analysis.   results data were categorised into four main themes: (1) awareness of cognitive changes during and following chemotherapy, (2) cognitive ability and confidence in return to work, (3) impact of cognitive changes on work ability and (4) information on the cognitive side effects of chemotherapy.   conclusions the views and experiences of breast cancer survivors towards returning to work and subsequent work ability were affected by chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment. more specifically the appraisal of returning to work and ability to manage work were influenced by three interrelated factors: (1) actual cognitive ability following chemotherapy, (2) awareness of cognitive failures by the women and their families and (3) the subsequent impact on their confidence in carrying out daily tasks including work tasks.   relevance to clinical practice more information and support is needed to help patients with cancer to manage chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairments in home and workplace. nurses are increasingly asked about the impact of cancer and its treatment on work and are therefore well positioned to offer this advice. subsequently, nurses require additional knowledge and guidance to provide this information and support.
quantitative trait loci for regional adiposity in mouse lines divergently selected for food intake our previous finding that a waist-to-hip ratio (whr) >0.85 was not associated with similar health risks in black, compared with white, obese premenopausal nondiabetic women of similar fatness is attributed to either 1) a different relationship between whr and visceral adiposity or 2) differences in the relationship between visceral adiposity and the metabolic abnormalities of obesity. we measured visceral (vat) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (scat) areas at midwaist in 25 black and 25 white obese nondiabetic premenopausal women with similar bmi, percentage body fat, and wide range of whr (0.7–0.95 for black women and 0.7–0.9 for white women) and then compared insulin sensitivity index (si), glucose and insulin areas under the 2-h curve (aucs) during an oral glucose tolerance test (ogtt), and blood lipids in the two groups before and after adjustments for total body and visceral adiposity. after adjusting for total body fat mass (fm), obese black women had significantly less vat (by 32 cm2) and lower vat/scat for any given whr. the regression equations predicting the si, the glucose and insulin aucs, and the triglyceride and hdl cholesterol levels from regional adipose tissue measurements (vat, scat, or vat/scat) and from total body fat (fm or percentage body fat) had slopes that were not significantly different for black and white women. ldl cholesterol levels were independently related to vat in black but not in white women. the black women had a similar si insulin auc, and triglyceride levels but significantly lower glucose auc and higher hdl cholesterol levels (p < 0.001), after adjusting for vat and fm. regression analysis of the pooled data showed that high vat and high vat/scat, but not scat, predicted lower si, higher glucose and insulin aucs during ogtt, and higher triglyceride levels, independent of total adiposity. we conclude that while increases in vat and vat/scat adversely affect metabolism in both black and white obese premenopausal women, similar levels of total body and visceral adiposity are associated with different metabolic risk factors in these groups.
hardware implementation of adder for pulse signal processing ultra low power wearable wireless patient monitoring systems will be critical for continuous remote monitoring of patients and fast transmission of data to medical personnel for timely intervention. this paper proposes a pulse based methodology for photoplethysmogram (ppg) feature discrimination using the time-based integrate and fire (if) sampler for continuous, portable pulse oximetry. the analog ppg is transformed into a sequence of time events where the time between two events represents a constant area under the analog ppg signal, with injective mapping between the two domains. a simple and robust method is formulated that directly estimates the systolic peak time from the output of the if sampler. the proposed processing method can be implemented in hardware using simple combinatorial logic and is comparable to performance of existing digital signal processing methods in the literature.
new insights into myosin phosphorylation during cyclic nucleotide-mediated smooth muscle relaxation phosphorylation of phospholemman (plm) on ser68 has been proposed to at least partially mediate cyclic amp (camp) mediated relaxation of arterial smooth muscle. we evaluated the time course of the phosphorylation of phospholemman (plm) on ser68, myosin regulatory light chains (mrlc) on ser19, and heat shock protein 20 (hsp20) on ser16 during a transient forskolin-induced relaxation of histamine-stimulated swine carotid artery. we also evaluated the dose response for forskolin- and nitroglycerin-induced relaxation in phenylephrine-stimulated plm-/- and plm+/+ mice. the time course for changes in ser19 mrlc dephosphorylation and ser16 hsp20 phosphorylation was appropriate to explain the forskolin-induced relaxation and the recontraction observed upon washout of forskolin. however, the time course for changes in ser68 plm phosphorylation was too slow to explain forskolin-induced changes in force. there was no difference in the phenylephrine contractile dose response or in forskolin-induced relaxation dose response observed in plm-/- and plm+/+ aortae. in aortae precontracted with phenylephrine, nitroglycerin induced a slightly, but significantly greater relaxation in plm-/- compared to plm+/+ aortae. these data are consistent with the hypothesis that ser19 mrlc dephosphorylation and ser16 hsp20 phosphorylation are involved in forskolin-induced relaxation. our data suggest that plm phosphorylation is not significantly involved in forskolin-induced arterial relaxation.
interactions between an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus and a soil microbial community mediating litter decomposition. effects of roots and of arbuscular-mycorrhizal (am) fungi on the composition of soil bacterial colonies and the combined effects of am fungus-rhizobacterium associations on plant and soil development are little-known. we grew sorghum (sorghum bicolor l.) either nonsymbiotically or colonized by one of two isolates of the am fungi glomus etunicatum, glomus intraradices, or glomus mosseae. the isolates were either exotic or native to the test soil. soils adhering (rhizosphere) or not adhering (hyphosphere) to the roots were sampled 45 days after planting. total populations of bacteria were estimated by counting colony-forming units on a nonselective medium and grouped by colony and cell morphology. rhizosphere populations of fluorescent pseudomonads were determined on p1 medium. visually distinct isolates were selected for identification by fatty-acid-methyl-esther analysis; of these 25 were found to be separate species. bacterial numbers were greater in rhizo- than in hyphosphere soil. isolates of bacillus and t arthrobacter were most frequent in hyphosphere and pseudomonas in rhizosphere soils. more bacterial species were encountered in hyphosphere than in rhizosphere soil, and bacterial communities varied within and among am treatments. the development of the am mycelium in soil had little influence on the composition of the microflora in the hyphosphere, while am root colonization was positively related with bacterial numbers in the hyphosphere and with the presence of pseudomonas in the rhizosphere. the results suggest that qualitative effects of the am fungal taxon on the hyphosphere, such as the nature of exudates, are more important to composition and proliferation of rhizobacteria than the quantitative development of am soil mycelia.
effect of ultrasound-enhanced transdermal drug delivery efficiency of nanoparticles and brucine before the design of brucine-containing transdermal formulations, the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of brucine following transdermal administration should be evaluated. in this study, the effect of addition of ethanol on solubility of bruicne was investigated and 20% ethanol was added into pbs to obtain 10mg/ml brucine solution. then three transdermal doses (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) were administered to mice to evaluate pharmacological activity. it had been demonstrated that brucine possessed analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity in a dose-dependent manner. cytotoxicities of brucine against various tumor cells including skin tumor cell were also compared in vitro. brucine was found to possess antitumor activity in a concentration and time-dependent manner and gastrointestinal tumor cells seemed to be more sensitive to brucine. then in vitro skin permeation behavior and in vivo pharmacokinetics following transdermal administration were further investigated. the cumulative amounts of brucine across mouse skin in vitro were found to be higher than 90%. the absolute bioavailability of brucine was determined to be 40.83%. and compared with intravenous administration, mrt and t1/2 values were increased about 8~12-fold by transdermal route. moreover, fluctuations of drug levels were found to be significantly decreased in tissues, especially in brain. finally, no dermal toxicity of brucine was observed. the results of this study indicated that transdermal administration might be beneficial for the sustained efficacy and reduced toxicity of brucine.
roles of phospho-gsk-3β in myocardial protection afforded by activation of the mitochondrial k atp channel. glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (gsk-3beta) is a multifunctional ser/thr kinase that plays important roles in necrosis and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. a major mechanism of cell necrosis is the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mptp), which consists of multiple protein subunits, including adenine nucleotide translocase (ant). the threshold for mptp opening is elevated by phosphorylation of gsk-3beta at ser9, which reduces activity of this kinase. how inactivation of gsk-3beta suppresses mptp opening has not been fully understood, but evidence to date suggests that preservation of hexokinase-ii in the mptp complex, inhibition of cyclophilin-d-ant binding, inhibition of p53 and inhibition of ant into the mitochondria are contributory. gsk-3beta phosphorylation is a step to which multiple protective signaling pathways converge, and thus gsk-3beta phosphorylation is crucial in cardioprotection of a variety of interventions against ischemia/reperfusion injury. apoptosis of cardiomyocytes by pressure overload or ischemia/reperfusion is also suppressed by inactivation of gsk-3beta, in which reduced phosphorylation of p53, heat shock factor-1 and myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1 and inhibition of bax translocation might be involved. considering predominant roles of gsk-3beta in cardiomyocyte death, manipulation of this protein kinase is a promising strategy for myocardial protection in coronary artery disease and heart failure.
harmonia axyridis (coleoptera: coccinellidae) in asia: a re-examination of the native range and invasion to southeastern kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan harmonia axyridis (pallas, 1773) (coleoptera: coccinellidae) is a ladybird beetle native to temperate and subtropical parts of asia. since 1916 populations of this species have been introduced throughout the world, either deliberately, or by accident through international transport. harmonia axyridis was originally released as a classical biological control agent of aphid and coccid pests in orchards and forests, but since 1994 it is also available as a commercial product for augmentative control in field and greenhouse crops. it is a very voracious and effective natural enemy of aphids, psyllids and coccids in various agricultural and horticultural habitats and forests. during the past 20 years, however, it has successfully invaded non-target habitats in north america (since 1988), europe (1999) and south america (2001) respectively in a short period of time, attacking a wide range of non-pest species in different insect orders. becoming part of the agricultural commercial pathway, it is prone to being introduced into large areas across the world by accident. we use the climex programme (v2) to predict the potential geographical distribution of h. axyridis by means of matching the climate of its region of origin with other regions in the world and taking in account biological characteristics of the species. establishment and spread seem likely in many regions across the world, including those areas which h. axyridis has already invaded (temperate europe, north america). based on the climex prediction a large part of mediterranean europe, south america, africa, australia and new zealand seem highly suitable for long-term survival of h. axyridis as well. in addition we evaluate climex as a strategic tool for estimating establishment potential as part of an environmental risk assessment procedure for biological control agents we discuss biological and ecological aspects necessary to fine-tune its establishment and spread in areas after it has been introduced.
two e-selectin ligands, bst-2 and lgals3bp, predict metastasis and poor survival of er-negative breast cancer. hematogenous metastasis involves the adhesion of circulating tumor cells to vascular endothelium of the secondary site. we hypothesized that breast cancer cell adhesion is mediated by interaction of endothelial e-selectin with its glycoprotein counter-receptor(s) expressed on breast cancer cells. at a hematogenous wall shear rate, zr-75-1 breast cancer cells specifically adhered to e-selectin expressing human umbilical vein endothelial cells when tested in parallel plate flow chamber adhesion assays. consistent with their e-selectin ligand activity, zr-75-1 cells expressed flow cytometrically detectable epitopes of heca-452 mab, which recognizes high efficiency e-selectin ligands typified by sialofucosylated moieties. multiple e-selectin reactive proteins expressed by zr-75-1 cells were revealed by immunoprecipitation with e-selectin chimera (e-ig chimera) followed by western blotting. mass spectrometry analysis of the 72 kda protein, which exhibited the most prominent e-selectin ligand activity, corresponded to mac-2 binding protein (mac-2bp), a heretofore unidentified e-selectin ligand. immunoprecipitated mac-2bp expressed sialofucosylated epitopes and possessed e-selectin ligand activity when tested by western blot analysis using heca-452 mab and e-ig chimera, respectively, demonstrating that mac-2bp is a novel high efficiency e-selectin ligand. furthermore, silencing the expression of mac-2bp from zr-75-1 cells by shrna markedly reduced their adhesion to e-selectin expressing cells under physiological flow conditions, confirming the functional e-selectin ligand activity of mac-2bp on intact cells. in addition to zr-75-1 cells, several other e-selectin ligand positive breast cancer cell lines expressed mac-2bp as detected by western blot and flow cytometry, suggesting that mac-2bp may be an e-selectin ligand in a variety of breast cancer types. further, invasive breast carcinoma tissue showed co-localized expression of mac-2bp and heca-452 antigens by fluorescence microscopy, underscoring the possible role of mac-2bp as an e-selectin ligand. in summary, breast cancer cells express mac-2bp as a novel e-selectin ligand, potentially revealing a new prognostic and therapeutic target for breast cancer.
association of mastication and factors affecting masticatory function with obesity in adults: a systematic review the effect of bite size on ingestion rate, satiation, and meal size was studied in nine lean and nine obese women. on separate days, subjects were given one of three bite sizes of sandwiches and one of two bite sizes of bagels with cream cheese to eat in a laboratory lunch. decreasing bite size significantly lowered ingestion rate for the whole meal. the effect was most pronounced at the beginning of meals. as bite size decreased from 15 to 5 g, the average ingestion rate decreased from (mean +/- sem) 19.4 +/- 2.0 to 15.9 +/- 2.0 g/min (p < 0.001). the initial ingestion rate decreased from 30.0 +/- 2.9 to 19.6 +/- 1.7 g/min (p < 0.001). the larger the bite size, the more quickly ingestion rate decelerated; by the end of meals, ingestion rate was not different across conditions. the decrease in ingestion rate with smaller bites was offset by an increase in meal duration, such that meal size did not differ across conditions. eating behavior of lean and obese subjects was not different. there were individual differences related to ingestion rate, but these were not related to body weight nor to meal size. these results bring into question the recommendation of behavior therapists that obese people eat more slowly in order to eat less.
ho x observations over west africa during amma: impact of isoprene and no x the measurement of oh reactivity, the inverse of the oh lifetime, provides a powerful tool to investigate atmospheric photochemistry. a new airborne oh reactivity instrument was designed and deployed for the first time on the nasa dc-8 aircraft during the second phase of inter- continental chemical transport experiment-b (intex-b) campaign, which was focused on the asian pollution out- flow over pacific ocean and was based in hawaii and alaska. the oh reactivity was measured by adding oh, generated by photolyzing water vapor with 185 nm uv light in a moveable wand, to the flow of ambient air in a flow tube and mea- suring the oh signal with laser induced fluorescence. as the wand was pulled back away from the oh detector, the oh signal decay was recorded; the slope of 1ln(signal)/1 time was the oh reactivity. the overall absolute uncer- tainty at the 2 confidence levels is about 1 s 1 at low al- titudes (for decay about 6 s 1 ), and 0.7 s 1 at high altitudes (for decay about 2 s 1 ). from the median vertical profile obtained in the second phase of intex-b, the measured oh reactivity (4.0±1.0 s 1 ) is higher than the oh reactiv-
the krebs cycle enzyme α-ketoglutarate decarboxylase is an essential glycosomal protein in bloodstream african trypanosomes abstract the dihydrolipoyl succinyltransferase (e2) of the multisubunit α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (α-kd) is an essential krebs cycle enzyme commonly found in the matrices of mitochondria. african trypanosomes developmentally regulate mitochondrial carbohydrate metabolism and lack a functional krebs cycle in the bloodstream of mammals. we found that despite the absence of a functional α-kd, bloodstream form (bf) trypanosomes express α-kde2, which localized to the mitochondrial matrix and inner membrane. furthermore, α-kde2 fractionated with the mitochondrial genome, the kinetoplast dna (kdna), in a complex with the flagellum. a role for α-kde2 in kdna maintenance was revealed in α-kde2 rna interference (rnai) knockdowns. following rnai induction, bloodstream trypanosomes showed pronounced growth reduction and often failed to equally distribute kdna to daughter cells, resulting in accumulation of cells devoid of kdna (dyskinetoplastic) or containing two kinetoplasts. dyskinetoplastic trypanosomes lacked mitochondrial membrane potential and contained mitochondria of substantially reduced volume. these results indicate that α-kde2 is bifunctional, both as a metabolic enzyme and as a mitochondrial inheritance factor necessary for the distribution of kdna networks to daughter cells at cytokinesis.
pleasant for some and unpleasant for others: a protocol analysis of the cognitive factors that influence affective responses to exercise background the intensity of physical activity has been found to be inversely related to adherence, thus contributing to the problem of physical inactivity. although most physical activity is unsupervised and participants, therefore, self-select the intensity, very little is known about the level of intensity that they select. we hypothesized that participants would select, on average, an intensity proximal to the level of transition from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism.   methods twenty-three middle-aged, formerly sedentary women participated in (a) an incremental treadmill test to determine their maximal aerobic capacity and gas exchange ventilatory threshold, an index of the aerobic-anaerobic transition, and (b) a 20-min bout of treadmill exercise during which they were allowed to select the speed.   results on average, but with considerable interindividual variability, the women selected an intensity that, in terms of treadmill speed, heart rate, oxygen uptake, and perceived exertion was no different from the intensity corresponding to their gas exchange ventilatory threshold. moreover, affective valence remained positive and stable.   conclusions on average, middle-aged, formerly sedentary women selected an intensity that is considered physiologically effective and reported that it did not feel hard or unpleasant. future research should examine the sources of interindividual variability and the consequences of exercising at an intensity that exceeds one's preferred level.
effects of the exotic invader musculista senhousia on benthic communities of two mediterranean lagoons synopsis. non-indigenous species (nis) are increasingly conspicuous in marine and estuarine habitats throughout the world, as the number, variety, and effects of these species continue to accrue. most of these nis invasions result from anthropogenic dispersal. although the relative importance of different dispersal mechanisms varies both spatially and temporally, the global movement of ballast water by ships appears to be the largest single vector for nis transfer today, and many recent invasions have resulted from this transfer. the rate of new invasions may have increased in recent decades, perhaps due to changes in ballast water transport. estuaries have been especially common sites of invasions, accumulating from tens to hundreds of nis per estuary that include most major taxonomic and trophic groups. we now know of approximately 400 nis along the pacific, atlantic and gulf coasts of the u.s., and hundreds of marine and estuarine nis are reported from other regions of the world. although available information about invasions is limited to a few regions and underestimates the actual number of nis invasions, there are apparent differences in the frequency of nis among sites. mechanisms responsible for observed patterns among sites likely include variation in supply of nis, and perhaps variation in properties of recipient or donor communities, but the role of these mechanisms has not been tested. although our present knowledge about the extent, patterns and mechanisms of marine invasions is still in its infancy, it is clear that nis are a significant force of change in marine and especially estuarine communities globally. taxonomically diverse nis are having significant effects on many, if not most, estuaries that fundamentally alter population, community, and ecosystems processes. the impacts of most nis remain unknown, and the predictability of their direct and indirect effects remains uncertain. nonetheless, based upon the documented extent of nis invasions and scope of then* effects, studies of marine communities that do not include nis are increasingly incomplete.
olfaction and environment: tsimane’ of bolivian rainforest have lower threshold of odor detection than industrialized german people objectives/hypothesis: goals of the study were to evaluate the frequency of olfactory dysfunction in a large representative population without sinonasal complaints and to investigate the extent to which general pathological conditions, medications, and aging influence olfaction.
role of the insula and vestibular system in patients with chronic subjective dizziness: an fmri study using sound-evoked vestibular stimulation the vestibular system--a sensor of head accelerations--cannot detect self-motion at constant velocity and thus requires supplementary visual information. the perception of self-motion during constant velocity movement is completely dependent on visually induced vection. this can be linear vection or circular vection (cv). cv is induced by large-field visual motion stimulation during which the stationary subject perceives the moving surroundings as being stable and himself as being moved. to determine the unknown cortical visual-vestibular interaction during cv, we conducted a pet activation study on cv in 10 human volunteers. the pet images of cortical areas activated during visual motion stimulation without cv were compared with those with cv. hitherto, cv was explained neurophysiologically by visual-vestibular convergence with activation of the vestibular nuclei, thalamic subnuclei and vestibular cortex. if cv were mediated by the vestibular cortex, one would expect that an adequate visual motion stimulus would activate both the visual and vestibular cortex. contrary to this expectation, it was shown for the first time that visual motion stimulation with cv not only activates a medial parieto-occipital visual area bilaterally, separate from middle temporal/medial superior temporal areas, it also simultaneously deactivates the parieto-insular vestibular cortex. there was a positive correlation between the perceived intensity of cv and relative changes in regional cbf in parietal and occipital areas. these findings support a new functional interpretation: reciprocal inhibitory visual-vestibular interaction as a multisensory mechanism for self-motion perception. inhibitory visual-vestibular interaction might protect visual perception of self-motion from potential vestibular mismatches caused by involuntary head accelerations during locomotion, and this would allow the dominant sensorial weight during self-motion perception to shift from one sensory modality to the other.
an integrated theory of language production and comprehension a number of internal model concepts are now widespread in neuroscience and cognitive science. these concepts are supported by behavioral, neurophysiological, and imaging data; furthermore, these models have had their structures and functions revealed by such data. in particular, a specific theory on inverse dynamics model learning is directly supported by unit recordings from cerebellar purkinje cells. multiple paired forward inverse models describing how diverse objects and environments can be controlled and learned separately have recently been proposed. the 'minimum variance model' is another major recent advance in the computational theory of motor control. this model integrates two furiously disputed approaches on trajectory planning, strongly suggesting that both kinematic and dynamic internal models are utilized in movement planning and control.
evidence of a latitudinal gradient in the age at onset of schizophrenia abstract evidence from nearly a century of epidemiological research indicates that schizophrenia occcurs in all populations with a prevalence in the range of 1.4 to 4.6 per 1000 and incidence rates in the range of 0.16–0.42 per 1000 population. multi-centre studies conducted by the world health organization have highlighted important differences between ‘western’ and ‘third world’ populations as regards the course and outcome of the disorder, with a significantly better prognosis in the developing countries. the factors underlying the better outcome of schizophrenia in developing countries remain essentially unknown but are likely to involve interactions between genetic variation and specific aspects of the environment. these features place schizophrenia, along with diabetes, cancer and hypertension, into the group of genetically complex diseases which are characterised by polygenic transmission, locus heterogeneity and environmental contribution to causation. the emerging pattern of risk factors and antecedents of schizophrenia suggests multiple, mainly quantitative deviations from the average developmental trajectory, primarily in the areas of early neurodevelopment, cognitive ability and social behaviour. these deviations are compatible with the notion of non-specific background factors facilitating the operation of genetically determined causal pathways. research likely to result in new insights should focus on the population distribution and behavioural effects of potential risk factors and markers suggested by biological and genetic research
hairpins participating in folding of human telomeric sequence quadruplexes studied by standard and t-remd simulations explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations have been used to complement preceding experimental and computational studies of folding of guanine quadruplexes (g-dna). we initiate early stages of unfolding of several g-dnas by simulating them under no-salt conditions and then try to fold them back using standard excess salt simulations. there is a significant difference between g-dnas with all-anti parallel stranded stems and those with stems containing mixtures of syn and anti guanosines. the most natural rearrangement for all-anti stems is a vertical mutual slippage of the strands. this leads to stems with reduced numbers of tetrads during unfolding and a reduction of strand slippage during refolding. the presence of syn nucleotides prevents mutual strand slippage; therefore, the antiparallel and hybrid quadruplexes initiate unfolding via separation of the individual strands. the simulations confirm the capability of g-dna molecules to adopt numerous stable locally and globally misfolded structures. the key point for a proper individual folding attempt appears to be correct prior distribution of syn and anti nucleotides in all four g-strands. the results suggest that at the level of individual molecules, g-dna folding is an extremely multi-pathway process that is slowed by numerous misfolding arrangements stabilized on highly variable timescales.
targeted capture in evolutionary and ecological genomics we report here the genome sequence of an ancient human. obtained from ∼4,000-year-old permafrost-preserved hair, the genome represents a male individual from the first known culture to settle in greenland. sequenced to an average depth of 20×, we recover 79% of the diploid genome, an amount close to the practical limit of current sequencing technologies. we identify 353,151 high-confidence single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps), of which 6.8% have not been reported previously. we estimate raw read contamination to be no higher than 0.8%. we use functional snp assessment to assign possible phenotypic characteristics of the individual that belonged to a culture whose location has yielded only trace human remains. we compare the high-confidence snps to those of contemporary populations to find the populations most closely related to the individual. this provides evidence for a migration from siberia into the new world some 5,500 years ago, independent of that giving rise to the modern native americans and inuit.
cytotoxic polyketides from the deep-sea-derived fungus engyodontium album dffscs021 three new sesquiterpenes, named aspergillusenes a and b and (+)-(7s)-7-o-methylsydonic acid, and two new hydrogenated xanthone derivatives, named aspergillusones a and b, were isolated from the sea fan-derived fungus aspergillus sydowii psu-f154 together with 10 known compounds. their structures were identified on the basis of spectroscopic data. the isolated compounds were evaluated for their antioxidant activity.
cognitive correlates of “neglect-like syndrome” in patients with complex regional pain syndrome the body schema is based on an intact cortical body representation. its disruption is indicated by delayed reaction times (rt) and high error rates when deciding on the laterality of a pictured hand in a limb laterality recognition task. similarities in both cortical reorganisation and disrupted body schema have been found in two different unilateral pain syndromes, one with deafferentation (phantom limb pain, plp) and one with pain-induced dysfunction (complex regional pain syndrome, crps). this study aims to compare the extent of impaired laterality recognition in these two groups. performance on a test battery for attentional performance (tap 2.0) and on a limb laterality recognition task was evaluated in crps (n=12), plp (n=12) and healthy subjects (n=38). differences between recognising affected and unaffected hands were analysed. crps patients and healthy subjects additionally completed a four-day training of limb laterality recognition. reaction time was significantly delayed in both crps (2278±735.7ms) and plp (2301.3±809.3ms) compared to healthy subjects (1826.5±517.0ms), despite normal tap values in all groups. there were no differences between recognition of affected and unaffected hands in both patient groups. both healthy subjects and crps patients improved during training, but rts of crps patients (1874.5±613.3ms) remain slower (p<0.01) than those of healthy subjects (1280.6±343.2ms) after four-day training. despite different pathomechanisms, the body schema is equally disrupted in plp and crps patients, uninfluenced by attention and pain and cannot be fully reversed by training alone. this suggests the involvement of complex central nervous system mechanisms in the disruption of the body schema.
increasing extracellular matrix collagen level and mmp activity induces cyst development in polycystic kidney disease background the appearance of interstitial fibrosis in polycystic kidneys is emblematic of progressive disease. matrix forming this scar tissue is derived from local renal cells in response to cystogenesis. we investigated the phenotype of collagen-producing cells in the cystic kidneys of dba/2-pcy mice to better characterize the spectrum of interstitial cells associated with renal fibrogenesis.   methods the extent of interstitial fibrosis and the number of fibroblasts in cystic kidneys were first quantitated over time using computer-assisted image analysis. subsequently, antisera to four cell protein markers were studied by coexpression immunohistochemistry during progression of fibrosis using confocal microscopy. the antisera included fibroblast-specific protein 1 (fsp1) for fibroblast phenotype, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-sma) for contractile phenotype, vimentin (vim) for mesenchymal phenotype, and heat shock protein 47 (hsp47) for interstitial collagen-producing phenotype.   results interstitial fibrosis in cystic kidneys gradually increased throughout the 30-week observation period of our study. with progression of cystogenesis, most of the tubules in pcy mice either dilated or disappeared with time. fsp1+ fibroblasts were distributed sparsely throughout the renal interstitium of young pcy and wild-type mice. their number increased in the widening fibrotic septa by 18 weeks of age and persisted through 30 weeks of the study interval. some epithelia among remnant tubules trapped within fibrotic septa around adjacent cysts also acquired the phenotype of fsp1+, hsp47+ collagen-producing fibroblasts, suggesting a possible role for epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (emt) in this process. most fsp1+ fibroblasts were alpha-sma-, but hsp47+, suggesting they were producing collagen proteins for the extracellular matrix. alpha-sma+, fsp1-, hsp47+ or hsp47- cells were also observed, and the latter tended to distribute independently in a linear pattern, reminiscent of vasculature adjacent to forming cysts. vim+ expression was not observed in alpha-sma+ cells.   conclusions many nonoverlapping as well as fewer overlapping populations of fsp1+ and alpha-sma+ cells shared in the collagen expression associated with progressive fibrogenesis in pcy mice undergoing cystogenesis. some fsp1+ fibroblasts are likely derived from tubular epithelium undergoing emt, while alphasma+, vim- cells probably represent vascular smooth muscle cells or pericytes surviving vessel attenuation during the chaos of fibrogenesis. importantly, not all interstitial cells producing collagens are alpha-sma+.
iranian health research networks and vision of iran by 2025: a case of virtual health network in emri abstracthealth research systems can link knowledge generation with practical concerns to improve health and health equity. interest in health research, and in how health research systems should best be organised, is moving up the agenda of bodies such as the world health organisation. pioneering health research systems, for example those in canada and the uk, show that progress is possible. however, radical steps are required to achieve this. such steps should be based on evidence not anecdotes. health research policy and systems (harps) provides a vehicle for the publication of research, and informed opinion, on a range of topics related to the organisation of health research systems and the enormous benefits that can be achieved. following the mexico ministerial summit on health research, who has been identifying ways in which it could itself improve the use of research evidence. the results from this activity are soon to be published as a series of articles in harps.this editorial provides an account of some of these recent key developments in health research systems but places them in the context of a distinguished tradition of debate about the role of science in society. it also identifies some of the main issues on which 'research on health research' has already been conducted and published, in some cases in harps. finding and retaining adequate financial and human resources to conduct health research is a major problem, especially in low and middle income countries where the need is often greatest. research ethics and agenda-setting that responds to the demands of the public are issues of growing concern. innovative and collaborative ways are being found to organise the conduct and utilisation of research so as to inform policy, and improve health and health equity. this is crucial, not least to achieve the health-related millennium development goals. but much more progress is needed. the editorial ends by listing a wide range of topics related to the above priorities on which we hope to feature further articles in harps and thus contribute to an informed debate on how best to achieve such progress.
ion channel clustering enhances weak electric field detection by neutrophils: apparent roles of skf96365-sensitive cation channels and myeloperoxidase trafficking in cellular responses application of extremely low frequency pulsed dc electric fields that are frequency- and phase-matched with endogenous metabolic oscillations leads to greatly exaggerated neutrophil extension and metabolic resonance wherein oscillatory nad(p)h amplitudes are increased. in the presence of a resonant field, migrating cell length grows from 10 to approximately 40 microm, as does the overall length of microfilament assemblies. in contrast, cells stop locomotion and become spherical when exposed to phase-mismatched fields. although cellular effects were not found to be dependent on electrode type and buffer, they were sensitive to temporal constraints (phase and pulse length) and cell surface charge. we suggest an electromechanical coupling hypothesis wherein applied electric fields and cytoskeletal polymerization forces act together to overcome the surface/cortical tension of neutrophils, thus promoting net cytoskeletal assembly and heightened metabolic amplitudes. metabolic resonance enhances reactive oxygen metabolic production by neutrophils. furthermore, cellular dna damage was observed after prolonged metabolic resonance using both single cell gel electrophoresis ('comet' assay) and 3'-oh dna labeling using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. these results provide insights into transmembrane signal processing and cell interactions with weak electric fields.
acetylcholinesterase plays a non-neuronal, non-esterase role in organogenesis despite in vitro demonstrations of non‐enzymatic morphogenetic functions in acetylcholinesterase (ache), the ache knockout phenotype is milder than might be expected, casting doubt upon the relevance of such functions in vivo. functional redundancy is a possible explanation. using in vitro findings that ache is able to bind to laminin‐111, together with detailed information about the interaction sites, as well as an epitope analysis of adhesion‐inhibiting anti‐ache mabs, we have used molecular docking and bioinformatics techniques to explore this idea, investigating structurally similar molecules that have a comparable spatiotemporal expression pattern in the embryonic nervous system. on this basis, molecules with which ache could be redundant are the syndecans, glypicans, perlecan, the receptor tyrosine kinase mer, and the low‐density lipoprotein receptor. it is also highly likely that ache may be redundant with the homologous neuroligins, although there is no evidence that the latter are expressed before synaptogenesis. ache was observed to dock with gas6, the ligand for mer, as well as with apolipoprotein e3 (but not apolipoprotein e4), both at the same site as the laminin interaction. these findings suggest that ache may show direct functional redundancy with one or more of these molecules; it is also possible that it may itself have a unique function in the stabilization of the basement membrane. as basement membrane molecules are characterized by multiple molecular interactions, each contributing cumulatively to the construction and stability of the network, this may account for ache’s apparently promiscuous interactions, and also for the survival of the knockout.
on clique-transversals and clique-independent sets abstract a minimum clique-transversal set mct ( g ) of a graph g =( v , e ) is a set s ⊆ v of minimum cardinality that meets all maximal cliques in g . a maximum clique-independent set mci ( g ) of g is a set of maximum number of pairwise vertex-disjoint maximal cliques. we prove that the problem of finding an mct ( g ) and an mci ( g ) is np -hard for cocomparability, planar, line and total graphs. as an interesting corollary we obtain that the problem of finding a minimum number of elements of a poset to meet all maximal antichains of the poset remains np -hard even if the poset has height two, thereby generalizing a result of duffas et al. (j. combin. theory ser. a 58 (1991) 158–164). we present a polynomial algorithm for the above problems on helly circular-arc graphs which is the first such algorithm for a class of graphs that is not clique-perfect . we also present polynomial algorithms for the weighted version of the clique-transversal problem on strongly chordal graphs, chordal graphs of bounded clique size, and cographs. the algorithms presented run in linear time for strongly chordal graphs and cographs. these mark the first attempts at the weighted version of the problem.
the common chymotrypsinogen c (ctrc) variant g60g (c.180t) increases risk of chronic pancreatitis but not recurrent acute pancreatitis in a north american population pancreatitis is a complex, progressively destructive inflammatory disorder. alcohol was long thought to be the primary causative agent, but genetic contributions have been of interest since the discovery that rare prss1, cftr and spink1 variants were associated with pancreatitis risk. we now report two associations at genome-wide significance identified and replicated at prss1-prss2 (p < 1 × 10−12) and x-linked cldn2 (p < 1 × 10−21) through a two-stage genome-wide study (stage 1: 676 cases and 4,507 controls; stage 2: 910 cases and 4,170 controls). the prss1 variant likely affects disease susceptibility by altering expression of the primary trypsinogen gene. the cldn2 risk allele is associated with atypical localization of claudin-2 in pancreatic acinar cells. the homozygous (or hemizygous in males) cldn2 genotype confers the greatest risk, and its alleles interact with alcohol consumption to amplify risk. these results could partially explain the high frequency of alcohol-related pancreatitis in men (male hemizygote frequency is 0.26, whereas female homozygote frequency is 0.07).
a framework for recognizing the simultaneous aspects of american sign language in this paper we present a novel approach to continuous, whole-sentence asl recognition that uses phonemes instead of whole signs as the basic units. our approach is based on a sequential phonological model of asl. according to this model the asl signs can be broken into movements and holds, which are both considered phonemes.this model does away with the distinction between whole signs and epenthesis movements that we made in previous work [17]. instead, epenthesis movements are just like the other movements that constitute the signs.we subsequently train hidden markov models (hmms) to recognize the phonemes, instead of whole signs and epenthesis movements that we recognized previously [17]. because the number of phonemes is limited, hmm-based training and recognition of the asl signal becomes computationally more tractable and has the potential to lead to the recognition of large-scale vocabularies.we experimented with a 22 word vocabulary, and we achieved similar recognition rates with phoneme-and word-based approaches. this result is very promising for scaling the task in the future.
proline-rich cell wall proteins accumulate in growing regions and phloem tissue in response to water deficit in common bean seedlings two antigenically related glycoproteins, called p33 and p36, accumulate in the soluble fraction of the cell wall in response to water deficit in phaseolus vulgaris. in this report, we show that p33 and p36 are able to adhere to leaf protoplasts, and that they bind to plasma membrane (pm) vesicles in a divalent cation-dependent manner. data from the partial amino acid sequence of the p33 and p36 proteins indicate that they contain repeats of the decapeptide povykpovek; therefore, they are related to proline-rich proteins. binding assays demonstrate that both proteins specifically bind to an 80 kda pm protein. this binding is competed with a peptide that contains the rgd motif, as well as with fibronectin, which also includes this sequence, suggesting that the 80 kda pm protein has an integrin-like function whose natural ligands are p33 and p36. this is the first case where a pm ligand for a higher plant cell wall protein has been identified.
messenger rna exchange between scions and rootstocks in grafted grapevines abstract. interspecific and intergeneric grafts of cucurbitaceae were used to study the mobility of structural p-proteins in the phloem. when cucumis sativus l. scions were grafted onto cucurbita rootstocks, at least nine additional proteins appeared on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels of scion exudate, 9–11 d after grafting. these proteins corresponded exactly to those of the respective cucurbita sp. rootstock, including the filament-forming phloem protein pp1 and the phloem lectin pp2, as shown by the apparent molecular weights and peptide maps. according to probing at three sites, the additional proteins were evenly distributed within the scion. the appearance of additional proteins was correlated with the establishment of phloem bridges across the graft union. the developmental coincidence establishes that the structural proteins or their precursors are translocated in the phloem. this translocation was a universal phenomenon in cucurbitaceae as shown by a comparative screening for additional proteins in eleven graft combinations, using benincasa hispida (thunb.) cogn., citrullus colocynthis (l.) schrad., cucumis melo l, c. sativus, cucurbita ficifolia bouché, cucurbita maxima duchesne ex lam., and trichosanthes cucumerina var. lobata roxb. according to this screening, the direction of transmission of additional proteins depended upon the combination tested. while some graft partners failed to show exchange, some behaved as “donor” for additional proteins and still others could be both “donor” or “acceptor”. however, whether used as scion or stock, c. sativus was consistently identified as an acceptor. the occurrence of additional proteins in heterografts is discussed with regard to the transport mechanism of structural p-proteins in the phloem and its relationship to assimilate transport.
successful nonsurgical treatment of pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, pneumoperitoneum, pneumoretroperitoneum, and subcutaneous emphysema following ercp endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp)-related perforation occurs in 0.1-1.8% of patients after therapeutic ercp. it is a serious complication with a high mortality. however, little evidence exists in the medical literature and the optimal management remains unclear. this review aims to critically evaluate the optimal management of therapeutic ercp-related perforation.
on clique-transversals and clique-independent sets abstract a minimum clique-transversal set mct ( g ) of a graph g =( v , e ) is a set s ⊆ v of minimum cardinality that meets all maximal cliques in g . a maximum clique-independent set mci ( g ) of g is a set of maximum number of pairwise vertex-disjoint maximal cliques. we prove that the problem of finding an mct ( g ) and an mci ( g ) is np -hard for cocomparability, planar, line and total graphs. as an interesting corollary we obtain that the problem of finding a minimum number of elements of a poset to meet all maximal antichains of the poset remains np -hard even if the poset has height two, thereby generalizing a result of duffas et al. (j. combin. theory ser. a 58 (1991) 158–164). we present a polynomial algorithm for the above problems on helly circular-arc graphs which is the first such algorithm for a class of graphs that is not clique-perfect . we also present polynomial algorithms for the weighted version of the clique-transversal problem on strongly chordal graphs, chordal graphs of bounded clique size, and cographs. the algorithms presented run in linear time for strongly chordal graphs and cographs. these mark the first attempts at the weighted version of the problem.
histochemical localization of enzymes and lipids in the ovary of a vespertilionid bat, scotophilus heathi, during the reproductive cycle. the histochemistry of lipids, δ5-3β-, 20α and 17β-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenases, glucose-6-phosphate and isocitrate dehydrogenases, nadh and nadph-diaphorases and acid phosphatase has been studied in the ovary of the cyclic hamster. none of the enzymes studied was present in the preantral follicles on day 1 (day of ovulation) or any day of the 4-day cycle. with the development of antral follicles (on day 3) a few fine lipid droplets appeared in the granulosa cells. the theca interna exhibited moderate amounts of nadh-diaphorase, δ5-3β-hsdh, 17β-hsdh and slight nadph-diaphorase, g-6-pdh and icdh, whereas the granulosa cells of antral follicles showed weak δ5-3β-hsdh, nadh-diaphorase and moderate 17β-hsdh but intense nadph-diaphorase, g-6-pdh and icdh activities. all enzyme activities in both theca and granulosa became more pronounced on proestrus (day 4).        in the corpora lutea (cl) all the above enzymes were present on day 1 and increased on day 2, followed by a rapid decline on days 3 and 4. lipids were sparsely represented in cl on days 1 and 2 but showed marked accumulations on days 3 and 4. likewise, acid phosphatase increased on days 3 and 4. the enzyme 20α-hsdh was not detectable in the cl.        the interstitium showed moderate amounts of lipids, δ5-3β-hsdh and nadh-diaphorase while 17β-hsdh, nadph-diaphorase, g-6-pdh and icdh were only weakly present. there were no appreciable changes in the lipid and various enzymes in the interstitium throughout the cycle except for δ5-3β-hsdh which increased slightly on the afternoon of day 4. acid phosphatase was not detected in appreciable amounts in the interstitium throughout the cycle.        these findings suggest that preantral follicles are unlikely to contribute to steroidogenesis. the antral follicles are the principal source of estrogen, with the granulosa being the major site of synthesis. the interstitium can serve as a major source of progesterone (p) while the theca interna and granulosa cells of antral follicles may form additional sites for p synthesis on the afternoon of day 4. the cl in the hamster are very short-lived and steroidogenesis in them may proceed beyond the synthesis of progesterone. the present findings are correlated with the steroid levels found during the cycle. appropriate comparisons are also made with the rat ovary.
associations between disability prevalence and local-area characteristics in a general community-living population. objectives social support and social networks have been shown to exert significant effects on health and functioning among elderly persons. although theorists have speculated that the strength of these effects may differ as a function of sociodemographic characteristics and prior health status, few studies have directly tested the moderating effects of these variables.   methods longitudinal data from the macarthur study of successful aging were used to examine the effects of structural and functional social support on changes in physical functioning over a 7-year period, measured by the nagi scale, in a sample of initially high-functioning men and women aged 70 to 79 years. multiple regression analyses were used to test the main effects of social support and social network variables, as well as their interactions with gender, income, and baseline physical performance.   results after controlling for potential confounding effects, respondents with more social ties showed less functional decline. the beneficial effects of social ties were stronger for respondents who were male or had lower levels of baseline physical performance.   discussion the effects of social support and social networks may vary according to the individual's gender and baseline physical capabilities. studies of functional decline among elderly persons should not ignore this population variation in the effects of social networks.
transcriptome adaptation of the bovine mammary gland to diets rich in unsaturated fatty acids shows greater impact of linseed oil over safflower oil on gene expression and metabolic pathways backgroundbovine milk fat composition is responsive to dietary manipulation providing an avenue to modify the content of fatty acids and especially some specific unsaturated fatty acid (usfa) isomers of benefit to human health. micrornas (mirnas) regulate gene expression but their specific roles in bovine mammary gland lipogenesis are unclear. the objective of this study was to determine the expression pattern of mirnas following mammary gland adaptation to dietary supplementation with 5 % linseed or safflower oil using next generation rna-sequencing.methodstwenty-four canadian holstein dairy cows (twelve per treatment) in mid lactation were fed a control diet (total mixed ration of corn:grass silages) for 28 days followed by a treatment period (control diet supplemented with 5 % linseed or safflower oil) of 28 days. milk samples were collected weekly for fat and individual fatty acid determination. rna from mammary gland biopsies harvested on day-14 (control period) and on days +7 and +28 (treatment period) from six randomly selected cows per treatment was subjected to small rna sequencing.resultsmilk fat percentage decreased significantly (p < 0.001) during treatment with the two diets as compared to the control period. the individual saturated fatty acids c4:0, c6:0, c8:0, c14:0 and c16:0 decreased significantly (p < 0.05) while five usfas (c14:1, c18:1n11t, c20:3n3, c20:5n3 and cla:t10c12) increased remarkably (p < 0.05) in response to both treatments. analysis of 361 million sequence reads generated 321 known bovine mirnas and 176 novel mirnas. the expression of fourteen and twenty-two mirnas was affected (p < 0.05) by linseed and safflower oil treatments, respectively. seven mirnas including six up-regulated (bta-mir-199c, mir-199a-3p, mir-98, mir-378, mir-148b and mir-21-5p) and one down-regulated (bta-mir-200a) were found to be regulated (p < 0.05) by both treatments, and thus considered core differentially expressed (de) mirnas. the gene targets of core de mirnas have functions related to gene expression and general cellular metabolism (p < 0.05) and are enriched in four pathways of lipid metabolism (3-phosphoinositide biosynthesis, 3-phosphoinositide degradation, d-myo-inisitol-5-phosphate metabolism and the superpathway of inositol phosphate compounds).conclusionour results suggest that de mirnas in this study might be important regulators of bovine mammary lipogenesis and metabolism. the novel mirnas identified in this study will further enrich the bovine mirnome repertoire and contribute to understanding mammary gland biology.
a mitochondria-anchored isoform of the actin-nucleating spire protein regulates mitochondrial division masterminding mitochondrial fission mitochondria are highly dynamic and undergo fusion and fission and they move in cells. defects in mitochondrial dynamics are implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases. recent findings have suggested that mitochondrial fission occurs preferentially at endoplasmic reticulum (er) contact sites, with er circumscribing mitochondria and possibly promoting the constriction of mitochondria during fission. korobova et al. (p. 464) now suggest that an er-localized formin, inf2, is required for mitochondrial fission and that inf2-mediated actin polymerization facilitates mitochondrial constriction. actin filaments between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria promote mitochondrial fission. mitochondrial fission is fundamentally important to cellular physiology. the dynamin-related protein drp1 mediates fission, and interaction between mitochondrion and endoplasmic reticulum (er) enhances fission. however, the mechanism for drp1 recruitment to mitochondria is unclear, although previous results implicate actin involvement. here, we found that actin polymerization through er-localized inverted formin 2 (inf2) was required for efficient mitochondrial fission in mammalian cells. inf2 functioned upstream of drp1. actin filaments appeared to accumulate between mitochondria and inf2-enriched er membranes at constriction sites. thus, inf2-induced actin filaments may drive initial mitochondrial constriction, which allows drp1-driven secondary constriction. because inf2 mutations can lead to charcot-marie-tooth disease, our results provide a potential cellular mechanism for this disease state.
cigarette smoke induction of interleukin-27/wsx-1 regulates the differentiation of th1 and th17 cells in a smoking mouse model of emphysema studies have focused on the events that influence the development of interleukin 17 (il-17)–producing t helper cells (th-17 cells) associated with autoimmunity, such as experimental autoimmune encephalitis, but relatively little is known about the cytokines that antagonize th-17 cell effector responses. here we show that il-27 receptor–deficient mice chronically infected with toxoplasma gondii developed severe neuroinflammation that was cd4+ t cell dependent and was associated with a prominent il-17 response. in vitro, treatment of naive primary t cells with il-27 suppressed the development th-17 cells induced by il-6 and transforming growth factor-β, which was dependent on the intracellular signaling molecule stat1 but was independent of inhibition of il-6 signaling mediated by the suppressor protein socs3. thus il-27, a potent inhibitor of th-17 cell development, may be a useful target for treating inflammatory diseases mediated by these cells.
‘ballroom itself can either make you or break you’ – black gbt youths’ psychosocial development in the house ball community objectives i incorporated qualitative methods to explore how hiv-related stigma functions in new york city's house and ball community (hbc).   methods from january through march 2009, i conducted 20 in-depth 1-on-1 interviews with a diverse sample of new york city hbc members. interviews addressed perceptions of hiv-related stigma, the treatment of hiv-positive members in the community, and the potential impact of hiv-related stigma on risk behaviors.   results hiv-related stigma contributes to a loss of moral experience for hbc members. moral experience (i.e., threats to what really matters in a community) disrupts established social connections and hinders the attainment of "ball status" (i.e., amassing social recognition) in the local world of these individuals.   conclusions my recommendations address hiv-related stigma in the new york city hbc from the vantage of moral experience and highlight the need for longitudinal studies of individual house members and for the implementation of stigma-focused interventions in the community that utilize the unique ball status hierarchy and hbc network to influence social norms surrounding the treatment of hiv-positive community members.
gentamicin-attenuated leishmania infantum vaccine: protection of dogs against canine visceral leishmaniosis in endemic area of southeast of iran we have previously described an attenuated line of leishmania infantum (h-line), selected by culturing promastigotes in vitro in the presence of gentamicin. to elucidate the molecular basis for this attenuation, we undertook a comparative proteomic analysis using multiplex 2-dimensional (2d) difference gel electrophoresis. eighteen proteins that showed significant and reproducible changes in expression were identified. many of these were components of the thiol-redox control system in leishmania and this observation, validated by western blot, prompted us to investigate the sensitivity of the attenuated line to oxidative stress. the attenuated line was found to be significantly more susceptible to hydrogen peroxide, a change which may explain the loss of virulence. in a direct assay of trypanothione-dependent peroxidase activity, hydrogen peroxide metabolism in the h-line was significantly lower than in wild type. furthermore, trypanothione reductase activity was significantly lower in the h-line, suggesting that gentamicin selection may result in pleiotropic affects on thiol metabolism in leishmania. a putative rna-binding protein was very strongly up-regulated in the attenuated line, suggesting a possible target for gentamicin in leishmania.
paracellular route is the major urate transport pathway across the blood‐placental barrier using continuous-flow luminal microperfusion techniques, the influence of the intraluminal urate concentration on urate absorption was determined in the rat proximal tubule. when the estimated contribution of passive permeation was accounted for, the "active" component of urate absorption demonstrated saturation kinetics. the apparent km was 0.17 mm and the vmax 0.31 pmol.min-1.mm-1. these transport constants were similar when derived from either a water-absorbing or steady-state equilibrium perfusion solution. the reflection coefficient was determined in studies employing the techniques of simultaneous capillary and luminal microperfusion. both perfusion solutions contained p-chloromercuribenzoate to inhibit active urate transport. in the presence or absence of an osmole gradient imposed across the tubule, the reflection coefficient for urate averaged 0.94. these studies provide evidence that urate absorption in the rat proximal tubule is a carrier-mediated process. they also provide independent confirmation of the passive flux coefficient derived in prior studies. finally, the results suggest that solvent drag would have little effect on urate absorption.
patterns of federated identity management systems as architectural reconfigurations we introduce architectural design rewriting (adr), an  approach to deal with the design of reconfigurable software  architectures. the key features we promote are:  (i) rule-based approach (over graphs);  (ii) hierarchical design;  (iii) algebraic presentation; and  (iv) inductively-defined reconfigurations.  architectures are suitably modeled by graphs whose edges and nodes respectively represent components and connection ports.  architectures are designed hierarchically by a set  of edge replacement rules that fix the architectural style.  depending on their reading, productions allow:  (i) top-down design by refinement,  (ii) bottom-up typing of actual architectures, and  (iii) well-formed composition of architectures.  the key idea is to encode style proofs as terms and to exploit such  information at run-time for guiding reconfigurations.  the main advantages of adr are that: (i) instead of reasoning on flat  architectures, adr specifications provide a convenient hierarchical  structure, by exploiting the architectural classes introduced by the style,  (ii) complex reconfiguration schemes can be defined inductively, and (iii)  style-preservation is guaranteed.
the ecology of conception and pregnancy failure in wild baboons abstract we investigated the long-standing premise in behavioral ecology that the environment affects behavior and demography. we did this by evaluating the extent to which year-to-year variability in the behavioral ecology of a nonhuman primate population could be modeled from meteorological patterns. data on activity profiles and home range use for baboons (papio cynocephalus) in amboseli, kenya, were obtained over a 10-year period for three social groups: two completely wild-foraging ones, and a third that supplemented its diet with refuse from a nearby tourist lodge. the relationships across years among activity budgeting, travel distance, group size, and measures of temperature and rainfall patterns differed among the social groups. although meteorological variation generally correlated with behavioral variation in the completely wild-foraging groups, different weather variables and direction of relationships resulted for each group. in addition, different relationships among variables were found before and after home-range shifts. the food-enhanced group spent half as much time foraging as did the other groups and therefore could be used to evaluate the relative extent to which foraging time was a limiting factor for resting and social time. under their relaxed ecological conditions, the food-enhanced animals increased resting time much more than social time. these findings, combined with supplementary information on the population, lead us to suggest that baboons use a suite of interrelated responses to ecological variability that includes not only changes in activity budgets, but also home-range shifts, changes in the length of the active period, and changes in group size through fissions. moreover, our results imply that group differences as well as interpopulational and interspecific differences in behavioral ecology provide significant sources of variability. therefore, social groups rather than populations may be the appropriate unit of analysis for understanding the behavioral ecology of baboons and other highly social primates. the different patterns we observed among groups may have fitness consequences for the individuals in those groups and thereby affect population structure over time.
macroalgae of izmir gulf: dictyotaceae exhibit high in vitro anti-cancer activity independent from their antioxidant capabilities reactive oxygen species are widely generated in biological systems. consequently humans have evolved antioxidant defence systems that limit their production. intracellular production of active oxygen species such as ± oh, o2 and h2o2 is associated with the arrest of cell proliferation. similarly, generation of oxidative stress in response to various external stimuli has been implicated in the activation of transcription factors and to the triggering of apoptosis. here we review how free radicals induce dna sequence changes in the form of mutations, deletions, gene ampli®cation and rearrangements. these alterations may result in the initiation of apoptosis signalling leading to cell death, or to the activation of several proto-oncogenes and/or the inactivation of some tumour suppressor genes. the regulation of gene expression by means of oxidants, antioxidants and the redox state remains as a promising therapeutic approach. several anticarcinogenic agents have been shown to inhibit reactive oxygen species production and oxidative dna damage, inhibiting tumour promotion. in addition, recombinant vectors expressing radical-scavenging enzymes reduce apoptosis. in conclusion, oxidative stress has been implicated in both apoptosis and the pathogenesis of cancer providing contrived support for two notions: free radical reactions may be increased in malignant cells and oxidant scavenging systems may be useful in cancer therapy. # 2000 published by elsevier science ltd. all rights reserved.
relationship between clinical and surgical findings and reparability of large and massive rotator cuff tears: a longitudinal study "cover the hole in the cuff." echoes from the past and voices from the present blend to give us the same message. the message is firm and authoritative, almost mesmerizing, yet almost unchanged since the time the edict was first issued by codman (1) almost 60 years ago. we all understand the concept of rotator cuff repair. it makes sense to repair a torn rotator cuff to its anatomic location. we restore the anatomy and hence restore the mechanics of the cuff. however, when faced with a massive tear that cannot be completely repaired, most orthopedic surgeons continue to be swayed by that ancient irresistible siren song of "cover the hole." a number of clever techniques have been used to cover the hole, including supraspinatus muscle slide (2), fascial graft (3), freeze-dried allograft (4), and tendon transposition (5,6). however, most of these techniques either ignore or openly violate the mechanics of the shoulder. a major purpose of this article is to encourage us as orthopedic surgeons to consider the multidisciplinary dimensions of a biologic problem: too often we seek biologic solutions to mechanical problems. for years, engineers have used professional horizontal cross-integration on major projects by employing experts from diverse fields to approach complex engineering problems. this allows the engineering team to evaluate a problem from a number of different perspectives. this approach reduces the possibility of overlooking some critically important
effects of duration of zilpaterol hydrochloride supplementation on growth performance, carcass traits and meat quality of grain-fed cull cows. the objective of this study was to benchmark carcasses and muscles from commercially identified fed (animals that were perceived to have been fed an increased plane of nutrition before slaughter) and nonfed cull beef and dairy cows and a-maturity, usda select steers, so that the muscles could be identified from cull cow carcasses that may be used to fill a void of intermediately priced beef steaks. carcass characteristics were measured at 24 h postmortem for 75 carcasses from 5 populations consisting of cull beef cows commercially identified as fed (b-f, n = 15); cull beef cows commercially identified as nonfed (b-nf, n = 15); cull dairy cows commercially identified as fed (d-f, n = 15); cull dairy cows commercially identified as nonfed (d-nf, n = 15); and a-maturity, usda select grade steers (sel, n = 15). nine muscles were excised from each carcass [m. infraspinatus, m. triceps brachii (lateral and long heads), m. teres major, m. longissimus dorsi (also termed lm), m. psoas major, m. gluteus medius, m. rectus femoris, and m. tensor fasciae latae] and subjected to warner-bratzler shear force testing and objective sensory panel evaluation after 14 d of postmortem aging. carcass characteristics differed (p < 0.05) among the 5 commercially identified slaughter groups for the traits of lean maturity, bone maturity, muscle score, hcw, fat color, subjective lean color, marbling, ribeye area, 12th-rib fat thickness, and preliminary yield grade. carcasses from commercially identified, fed cull cows exhibited more (p < 0.01) weight in carcass lean than did commercially identified, nonfed cull cows. there was a group x muscle interaction (p = 0.02) for warner-bratzler shear force. warner-bratzler shear force and sensory overall tenderness values demonstrates that muscles from the sel group were the most tender (p < 0.01), whereas muscles from the b-nf group were the least tender (p < 0.01). sensory, beef flavor intensity was similar (p > 0.20) among cull cow carcass groups and more intense (p < 0.01) than the sel carcass group. muscles from the sel group exhibited less (p < 0.01) detectable off-flavor than the cull cow carcass groups, whereas the b-nf group exhibited the most (p < 0.01) detectable off-flavor. although carcass and muscle quality from commercially identified, fed, cull beef and dairy cows was not similar to a-maturity, usda select beef, they did show improvements when compared with nonfed, cull, beef and dairy cow carcasses and muscles.
sources of seasonal fractional integration in macroeconomic time series a simple construction that will be referred to as an error-duration model is shown to generate fractional integration and long memory. an error-duration representation also exists for many familiar arma models, making error duration an alternative to autoregression for explaining dynamic persistence in economic variables. the results lead to a straightforward procedure for simulating fractional integration and establish a connection between fractional integration and common notions of structural change. two examples show how the error-duration model could account for fractional integration in aggregate employment and in asset price volatility.
the krebs cycle enzyme α-ketoglutarate decarboxylase is an essential glycosomal protein in bloodstream african trypanosomes abstract the dihydrolipoyl succinyltransferase (e2) of the multisubunit α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (α-kd) is an essential krebs cycle enzyme commonly found in the matrices of mitochondria. african trypanosomes developmentally regulate mitochondrial carbohydrate metabolism and lack a functional krebs cycle in the bloodstream of mammals. we found that despite the absence of a functional α-kd, bloodstream form (bf) trypanosomes express α-kde2, which localized to the mitochondrial matrix and inner membrane. furthermore, α-kde2 fractionated with the mitochondrial genome, the kinetoplast dna (kdna), in a complex with the flagellum. a role for α-kde2 in kdna maintenance was revealed in α-kde2 rna interference (rnai) knockdowns. following rnai induction, bloodstream trypanosomes showed pronounced growth reduction and often failed to equally distribute kdna to daughter cells, resulting in accumulation of cells devoid of kdna (dyskinetoplastic) or containing two kinetoplasts. dyskinetoplastic trypanosomes lacked mitochondrial membrane potential and contained mitochondria of substantially reduced volume. these results indicate that α-kde2 is bifunctional, both as a metabolic enzyme and as a mitochondrial inheritance factor necessary for the distribution of kdna networks to daughter cells at cytokinesis.
expression levels and clinical significance of mir-21-5p, mir-let-7a, and mir-34c-5p in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma in this study, we report for the first time reduced expression of the let-7 microrna in human lung cancers. interestingly, 143 lung cancer cases that had undergone potentially curative resection could be classified into two major groups according to let-7 expression in unsupervised hierarchical analysis, showing significantly shorter survival after potentially curative resection in cases with reduced let-7 expression (p = 0.0003). multivariate cox regression analysis showed this prognostic impact to be independent of disease stage (hazard ratio = 2.17; p = 0.009). in addition, overexpression of let-7 in a549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line inhibited lung cancer cell growth in vitro. this study represents the first report of reduced expression of let-7 and the potential clinical and biological effects of such a microrna alteration.
the inability of bacillus licheniformis perr mutant to grow is mainly due to the lack of perr-mediated fur repression perr is a ferric uptake repressor (fur) homolog that functions as the central regulator of the inducible peroxide stress response in bacillus subtilis. perr has been previously demonstrated to regulate the mrga, kata, ahpcf, hemaxcdbl, and zosa genes. we now demonstrate that perr also mediates both the repression of its own gene and that of fur. whereas perr-mediated repression of most target genes can be elicited by either manganese or iron, repression of perr and fur is selective for manganese. genetic studies indicate that repression of perr regulon genes by either manganese or iron requires perr and is generally independent of fur. indeed, in a fur mutant, iron-mediated repression is enhanced. unexpectedly, repression of the fur gene by manganese appears to require both perr and fur, but only perr binds to the fur regulatory region in vitro. the fur mutation appears to act indirectly by affecting cellular metal ion pools and thereby affecting perr-mediated repression. while many components of the perr regulon are strongly induced by hydrogen peroxide, little, if any, induction of fur and perr could be demonstrated. thus, not all components of the perr regulon are components of the peroxide stimulon. we suggest that perr exists in distinct metallated forms that differ in dna target selectivity and in sensitivity to oxidation. this model is supported by the observation that the metal ion composition of the growth medium can greatly influence the transcriptional response of the various perr regulon genes to hydrogen peroxide.
human west nile virus infection in bosnia and herzegovina. west nile virus (wnv), the most widely distributed flavivirus worldwide, has lately reemerged in europe, causing worrisome outbreaks in humans and horses. serological analysis by enzyme-linked immunoassay and plaque reduction neutralization test showed for the first time in serbia that 12% of 349 horses presented specific neutralizing wnv antibodies, which in one case also cross-neutralized usutu virus (usuv). this is the first time that anti-usuv high neutralizing antibody titers are reported in horses. all these data indicate that wnv and usuv are circulating in the region and advise on the convenience of implementing surveillance programs.
world health organization reference values for human semen characteristics. few objective data are available concerning the psychological profiles and attitudes of sperm donors in artificial insemination programs. we studied 30 consecutive new volunteers and 45 established sperm donors using the cattell 16pf personality profile and an attitudinal survey concerning motives for donation, attitudes toward uses of sperm, desire for knowledge of outcomes, and attitudes toward disclosures of identifying and nonidentifying information between the parties to artificial insemination. donors differed from the population norms in 7 of 16 first-order and 1 of 4 second-order personality factors, and this difference appeared to reflect their self-selection as donors. the predominant motive for donation was altruism, but secondary motives were also common. financial motivation was very low in this population with few students. donors approved of all current and most hypothetical uses of sperm but were not in favor of disclosures of information to other participants in the program. restriction of disclosures to nonidentifying details was more acceptable. unmarried donors were more often motivated for nonaltruistic reasons and were more in favor of disclosures. attitudes of sperm donors were mostly stable over at least 3 years, but an increasing minority with time envisaged circumstances that might lead to their withdrawal from the program.
seasonality in iranian fruit and vegetable dietary intake objective to study the change of intake of nutrients in a year, and determine whether there is any change of intake of nutrition according to different seasons of the people in both northern and southern china.   methods the method of 24-hour diet history recall was used to study about 300 healthy adults in three areas, a rural area in the northern and rural plus urban areas in the southern. the study was carried out once per two month, and each time last 3 days. based on the amount of food intake, the amount of both nutrition and energy per person and per day was calculated.   results the amount of energy, protein, carbohydrate, fat intake of the residents in three areas was adequate. there was almost no significant difference of intake of energy and three major nutrients (protein, fat and carbohydrate) both in the southern and northern part of china among different seasons, as well as the seasonal intake of thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin e, niacin, and zinc. while the difference of intake of retinol (microg re), ascorbic acid, potassium and calcium were significant among different seasons.   conclusion this study showed that, in rural areas, any dietary survey should avoid january and july, which is either slack or busy season for farmers. in urban areas, any time of a year should not influence the results of a dietary survey.
targeting cd22 with the monoclonal antibody epratuzumab modulates human b-cell maturation and cytokine production in response to toll-like receptor 7 (tlr7) and b-cell receptor (bcr) signaling introductioncytokines produced by b cells are believed to play important roles in autoimmune diseases. cd22 targeting by epratuzumab has been demonstrated to inhibit phosphorylation of b cell receptor (bcr) downstream signaling in b cells. it has been shown that other sialoadhesin molecules related to cd22 have immunoregulatory functions; therefore, in the present study, we addressed the role of epratuzumab on the production of key cytokines by b cells of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) and of healthy donors (hd).methodsperipheral blood b cells were purified and activated by bcr with or without toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9) stimulation in the presence or absence of epratuzumab. cytokine production by b cells (interleukin [il]-6, tumor necrosis factor [tnf]-α and il-10) in the supernatant and the induction of il-10+ b cells from patients with sle and hd were analyzed.resultsthe secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines tnf-α and il-6 by anti-bcr and bcr- and/or tlr9-activated b cells from hd and patients with sle was inhibited by epratuzumab. in contrast, the production of il-10 by b cells was not affected by epratuzumab under either stimulation condition. consistently, the induction of il-10–producing b cells in culture was not affected by epratuzumab.conclusionsepratuzumab, by targeting cd22, was able to inhibit the production of the proinflammatory cytokines il-6 and tnf-α by b cells, in contrast to il-10, in vitro. these data suggest that targeting cd22 alters the balance between proinflammatory cytokines (tnf-α, il-6) and the regulatory cytokine il-10 as another b cell effector mechanism.
otolaryngologic aspects of oral-facial-digital syndrome. another case of median cleft lip associated with bimanual hexadactyly and bilateral accessory toes is presented. this is the third instance of the anomaly in a patient of indian descent out of four cases reported in the literature.
biomedical factors associated with hospitalization of older adults: the bambuí health and aging study (bhas). background the aims of the study were to describe the pattern of hospital utilization (acute and mental health sectors) of the paisley-renfrew midspan cohort and assess the influence of biological, behavioural and social 'risk factors' (established at the time of screening) on subsequent hospital admissions.   method a cohort analysis was carried out in paisley and renfrew, two post-industrial towns in west central scotland. this used a linked data set covering a 23 year follow-up period to combine original 'risk'-related data with subsequent routine hospital admissions data. the subjects were 8349 women and 7057 men, aged 45-64 in the early to mid-1970s, and representing approximately 80 per cent of the eligible population. the main outcome measures were patterns of hospital utilization (acute and mental health sectors), 'any acute hospital admission', 'a serious acute hospital admission' and 'death' (relative risks of each outcome were calculated for all risk factors).   results the following patterns of hospital utilization were found. only 5 per cent experienced a mental health admission but mean stay was long (265 bed days per cohort member admitted). in contrast, 79 per cent experienced at least one acute hospital stay. the age-specific proportions of cohort members requiring admission increased over time but the growth in acute episodes was even higher (suggesting increasing rates of multiple admission). for non-survivors, 42 per cent of all acute episodes (55 per cent of bed days) took place during the 12 months before death. analysis of risk factors (using cox's proportional hazards model) of 'any admission' and 'a serious admission' showed forced expiratory volume (fev1), age, sex, smoking status, blood pressure, blood sugar, body mass index, cholesterol and deprivation category to be important predictors.   conclusions despite the desirability of alternative settings of care for the chronically ill and dying, a high proportion of hospital bed days were required near the time of death. the absolute size of the demand for hospital services within the cohort was strikingly large and increasing over time. strategies to address the tide of rising admissions will have to confront the increasing proportion of individuals requiring admission as well as the growth in multiple admissions. those who were at higher risk of admission were the older members of the cohort (especially men), those with low fev1, smokers, those who were underweight or obese, the small number with abnormal levels of blood sugar, those with high blood pressure and those who lived in the most deprived areas. thus, programmes which affect these determinants of ill health may be useful in reducing age-specific admission rates.
a data-driven approach to infer knowledge base representation for natural language relations learning embeddings of entities and relations is an efficient and versatile method to perform machine learning on relational data such as knowledge graphs. in this work, we propose holographic embeddings (hole) to learn compositional vector space representations of entire knowledge graphs. the proposed method is related to holographic models of associative memory in that it employs circular correlation to create compositional representations. by using correlation as the compositional operator, hole can capture rich interactions but simultaneously remains efficient to compute, easy to train, and scalable to very large datasets. experimentally, we show that holographic embeddings are able to outperform state-of-the-art methods for link prediction on knowledge graphs and relational learning benchmark datasets.
predictors of postprandial hypotension in elderly patients with de novo parkinson’s disease postprandial hypotension was first recognized as a clinical problem in 1977 in a patient with parkinson disease [1]. however, the hypotensive effect of meal ingestion has been appreciated for a longer time. in 1935, gladstone [2] described a hypertensive patient who had had a postprandial decrease in blood pressure from 185/120 mm hg to 145/80 mm hg. in 1953, smirk [3] observed a decrease in blood pressure after patients with autonomic failure ingested food. robertson and colleagues [4] confirmed these results in patients with chronic autonomic failure and found an average decrease in systolic blood pressure of 49 6 mm hg after a meal [4]. since lipsitz and colleagues [5] first described it in nursing home residents a decade ago, postprandial hypotension has become recognized as a common disorder of blood pressure regulation in the elderly [5]. our current understanding of postprandial hypotension is limited by the lack of a standardized, clinically meaningful definition. analogous to orthostatic hypotension, postprandial hypotension is commonly defined in the literature as a decrease in systolic blood pressure of 20 mm hg or more within 2 hours of the start of a meal. postprandial hypotension also develops when the absolute level of systolic blood pressure after a meal decreases to less than 90 mm hg and when the systolic blood pressure before a meal is greater than 100 mm hg. in addition, if a meal-related decrease in systolic blood pressure exceeds the threshold for cerebral autoregulation, patients may become symptomatic when the absolute systolic blood pressure level exceeds 90 mm hg or when the postprandial systolic blood pressure decreases to less than 20 mm hg. the frequent absence of symptoms associated with this decrease in blood pressure after meal ingestion makes the value of this definition uncertain. in addition, the morbidity and mortality related to postprandial hypotension are unknown. a potential cumulative effect of multiple hypotensive stresses, such as posture change or administration of medication at the time of meal ingestion, makes assessment of the clinical relevance of individual blood pressure responses to a meal even more difficult. although it can be exacerbated by posture change, postprandial hypotension is a distinct entity that differs from orthostatic hypotension. we have reviewed the current knowledge of the epidemiology, clinical symptoms and significance, pathophysiology, and management of postprandial hypotension. we hope to make the practicing physician more aware of this common abnormality in blood pressure regulation and to stimulate new research of its mechanisms and management. methods through a medline search, we identified all articles on postprandial hypertension published between 1966 and 1994. we also used the bibliographies of relevant articles. all articles and case reports describing meal-related hypotension in the elderly and in patients with autonomic failure were included for analysis. epidemiology and associated conditions during the past decade, hypotension in response to ingestion of a mixed meal or oral glucose has been shown in healthy elderly persons [6-14]; young and elderly persons with hypertension [10, 15-21]; elderly patients in nursing homes [5, 22-25]; and patients with postprandial syncope [26, 27], autonomic insufficiency [4, 28-36], parkinson disease [1, 37-39], paraplegia [40], diabetes mellitus [28, 38, 41], cardiovascular disease [42, 43], and renal failure treated with hemodialysis [44, 45]. however, the epidemiology of postprandial hypotension has not been thoroughly studied. mild, meal-induced decreases in blood pressure are common in healthy older persons [6-11], but the prevalence of these decreases is unknown. the presence of multiple illnesses in elderly persons may further impair cardiovascular adaptation to meal ingestion and result in marked postprandial decreases in blood pressure. investigations of elderly persons living in nursing homes have shown that nearly all persons experience some decrease in blood pressure [24, 25]. in 24% to 36% of these patients, systolic blood pressure decreases more than 20 mm hg within 75 minutes of eating a meal [24, 25]. it has been difficult to dissociate the effects of physiologic aging on postprandial blood pressure regulation from those of age-associated illnesses. the elevation in blood pressure associated with aging can profoundly influence postprandial blood pressure. in a study of 82 healthy persons aged 19 to 79 years, meal-related reductions in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly correlated. however, when the data were corrected for baseline blood pressure, this correlation was no longer seen [46]. older hypertensive persons have greater reductions in blood pressure after ingesting food or oral glucose than do age-matched normotensive persons [7, 9, 10, 17-20]. postprandial decreases in systolic blood pressure ranging from 17 to 25 mm hg have been found in hypertensive elderly patients older than age 65 years who did not have other overt cardiovascular diseases [9, 10, 17, 18]. in these patients, diastolic blood pressure may decrease as much as 15 mm hg. however, because hypertensive middle-aged and young persons also have postprandial decreases in blood pressure [10, 16], this phenomenon may be primarily caused by blood pressure elevation rather than by aging itself. profound postprandial hypotension has been observed in patients with autonomic failure [1, 4, 28-36, 47, 48]. the first case report described a 65-year-old man who had dizziness and visual disturbance associated with large decreases in blood pressure after almost every meal [1]. robertson and colleagues [4] found a marked postprandial decrease in sitting systolic blood pressure (range, 22 to 98 mm hg) in 10 patients with autonomic failure. hoeldtke and associates [28, 47] studied patients with multiple-system atrophy (the shy-drager syndrome) and pure autonomic failure and found that the decrease in the mean sitting postprandial arterial blood pressure ranged from 62 to 83 mm hg [28, 47]. all of these patients had blurred vision and dizziness after the meal [47]. postprandial hypotension is also commonly found in patients with peripheral neuropathy caused by diabetes mellitus or other disorders [28, 33, 38, 41] as well as by parkinson disease [1, 37-39]. hypotension is a common side effect of antiparkinsonian drugs such as levodopa. in patients with renal failure, symptomatic postprandial hypotension has been seen during hemodialysis [44, 45]. this appears to be relevant primarily in uremic patients who have autonomic dysfunction. determining the prevalence and clinical implications of postprandial hypotension is complicated not only by different diseases and drugs in the populations studied but also by methodologic inconsistencies among studies. first, the body's position while the meal is being consumed probably affects food-induced changes in blood pressure. postprandial hypotension occurs both in the sitting and supine positions. although the sitting position is more physiologic, orthostatic changes in blood pressure during prolonged sitting might contribute to the postprandial decrease in blood pressure. second, no studies have addressed the variability of postprandial blood pressure. previous studies have shown that orthostatic blood pressure measurements in the elderly vary considerably from day to day [49]. this could also be true for postprandial hypotension. third, the nutrient composition of meals affects the magnitude of the decrease in postprandial blood pressure [12, 13, 15, 50]. carbohydrates and, more specifically, glucose have been found to play a significant role [10, 29]. however, conflicting data have been reported about the influence of fat or protein on postprandial blood pressure [12, 13, 15, 51, 52]. fourth, postprandial hypotension depends on the temperature of the meal [53]. after cold glucose solutions are ingested, blood pressure remains unchanged, whereas glucose solutions served warm or at room temperature cause a decrease in blood pressure. finally, the time at which blood pressure is measured after a meal may influence the detection of this phenomenon. postprandial hypotension can be found at all meal times [14] and is almost immediately apparent after a meal. blood pressure usually reaches a nadir within 30 to 60 minutes. in nursing home residents, the systolic blood pressure nadir occurred as early as 15 minutes after the meal in 13% to 17% of the patients and as late as 75 minutes after the meal in 11% to 13% of the patients [24, 25]. clinical symptoms and significance in elderly persons or patients with autonomic failure, postprandial reductions in blood pressure may result in syncope, falls, angina pectoris, weakness, dizziness, nausea, lightheadedness, or black spots in the visual field [1, 5, 22, 24-26, 29, 39, 46] (table 1). in addition, case reports have described elderly patients with large postprandial reductions in blood pressure who developed angina pectoris or transient ischemic attacks that resolved as blood pressure returned to normal [24, 54]. however, data on the frequency of postprandial hypotension and its potential symptoms are scarce. in one recent study, half of a group of patients with unexplained syncope had postprandial hypotension [27]. table 1. clinical symptoms associated with postprandial hypotension the cerebral symptoms probably depend on the extent to which cerebral perfusion is compromised. accumulation of age- and disease-related conditions that threaten cerebral blood flow or reduce oxygen content in the blood may bring cerebral oxygen delivery near the threshold needed to maintain consciousness [55]. therefore, even small changes in blood pressure may reduce cerebral oxygen delivery to below the critical threshold and thus result in ischemic symptoms. the potential for postprandial cerebral ischemia may be greater in elderly p
an application to two-hop forwarding of a model of buffer occupancy in icns over the past decade, mobile computing and wireless communication have become increasingly important drivers of many new computing applications. the field of wireless sensor networks particularly focuses on applications involving autonomous use of compute, sensing, and wireless communication devices for both scientific and commercial purposes. this paper examines the research decisions and design tradeoffs that arise when applying wireless peer-to-peer networking techniques in a mobile sensor network designed to support wildlife tracking for biology research.the zebranet system includes custom tracking collars (nodes) carried by animals under study across a large, wild area; the collars operate as a peer-to-peer network to deliver logged data back to researchers. the collars include global positioning system (gps), flash memory, wireless transceivers, and a small cpu; essentially each node is a small, wireless computing device. since there is no cellular service or broadcast communication covering the region where animals are studied, ad hoc, peer-to-peer routing is needed. although numerous ad hoc protocols exist, additional challenges arise because the researchers themselves are mobile and thus there is no fixed base station towards which to aim data. overall, our goal is to use the least energy, storage, and other resources necessary to maintain a reliable system with a very high `data homing' success rate. we plan to deploy a 30-node zebranet system at the mpala research centre in central kenya. more broadly, we believe that the domain-centric protocols and energy tradeoffs presented here for zebranet will have general applicability in other wireless and sensor applications.
closed-form solutions for options in incomplete markets february , 2013 in this paper we study both market risks and nonmarket risks, without complete markets assumption, and discuss methods of measurement of these risks. we present and justify a set of four desirable properties for measures of risk, and call the measures satisfying these properties "coherent." we examine the measures of risk provided and the related actions required by span, by the sec/nasd rules, and by quantile-based methods. we demonstrate the universality of scenario-based methods for providing coherent measures. we offer suggestions concerning the sec method. we also suggest a method to repair the failure of subadditivity of quantile-based methods. copyright blackwell publishers inc 1999.
a prospective randomized trial using blood volume analysis in addition to pulmonary artery catheter, compared with pulmonary artery catheter alone, to guide shock resuscitation in critically ill surgical patients background recent studies have suggested that early goal-directed resuscitation of patients with septic shock and conservative fluid management of patients with acute lung injury (ali) can improve outcomes. because these may be seen as potentially conflicting practices, we set out to determine the influence of fluid management on the outcomes of patients with septic shock complicated by ali.   methods a retrospective analysis was performed at barnes-jewish hospital (st. louis, mo) and in the medical icu of mayo medical center (rochester, mn). patients hospitalized with septic shock were enrolled into the study if they met the american-european consensus definition of ali within 72 h of septic shock onset. adequate initial fluid resuscitation (aifr) was defined as the administration of an initial fluid bolus of >or= 20 ml/kg prior to and achievement of a central venous pressure of >or= 8 mm hg within 6 h after the onset of therapy with vasopressors. conservative late fluid management (clfm) was defined as even-to-negative fluid balance measured on at least 2 consecutive days during the first 7 days after septic shock onset.   results the study cohort was made up of 212 patients with ali complicating septic shock. hospital mortality was statistically lowest for those achieving both aifr and clfm and higher for those achieving only clfm, those achieving only aifr, and those achieving neither (17 of 93 patients [18.3%] vs 13 of 31 patients [41.9%] vs 30 of 53 patients [56.6%] vs 27 of 35 [77.1%], respectively; p < 0.001).   conclusions both early and late fluid management of septic shock complicated by ali can influence patient outcomes.
two-component dirac-like hamiltonian for generating quantum walk on one-, two- and three-dimensional lattices we present an approach using quantum walks (qws) to redistribute ultracold atoms in an optical lattice. different density profiles of atoms can be obtained by exploiting the controllable properties of qws, such as the variance and the probability distribution in position space using quantum coin parameters and engineered noise. the qw evolves the density profile of atoms in a superposition of position space resulting in a quadratic speedup of the process of quantum phase transition. we also discuss implementation in presently available setups of ultracold atoms in optical lattices.
associations between osteoprotegerin polymorphisms and bone mineral density: a meta-analysis given that osteoprotegerin plays an important role in bone remodeling, the osteoprotegerin gene may be a candidate locus for susceptibility to osteoporosis. the relation of polymorphisms in the promoter of the osteoprotegerin gene to bone mineral density (bmd) was examined in a japanese population-based prospective cohort study with randomly recruited subjects (1095 women and 1125 men for the 950t --> c polymorphism, 1094 women and 1127 men for the 245t --> g polymorphism). bmd at the radius was measured by peripheral quantitative computed tomography, and that for the total body, lumbar spine, right femoral neck, right trochanter, and right ward's triangle was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. genotypes were determined with a fluorescence-based allele-specific dna primer assay system. among 950t --> c genotypes, bmd for the proximal radius was lower in premenopausal women with the cc genotype than in those with the tt or tc genotype; the difference in bmd between the two groups was 3.9% (p=0.0075). among 245t --> g genotypes, bmd for the radius, total body, femoral neck, trochanter, and ward's triangle was lower in postmenopausal women with the gg genotype than in those with the tt or tg genotype, the tt genotype, or the tg genotype; the differences in bmd between the gg genotype and the tt or tg genotype were 19.8% for the distal radius (p=0.0015), 13.1% for the proximal radius (p=0.0095), 11.2% for the total body (p=0.0013), 12.9% for the femoral neck (p=0.0067), 18.7% for the trochanter (p=0.0008), and 27.1% for ward's triangle (p=0.0038). bmd was not associated with the 950t --> c or 245t --> g genotypes in men. the present results implicate the osteoprotegerin gene as a susceptibility locus for reduced bmd in japanese women.
global gene expression responses to waterlogging in leaves of rape seedlings background and aims dna microarrays allow comprehensive estimation of total cellular mrna levels but are also amenable to studies of other mrna populations, such as mrnas in translation complexes (polysomes). the aim of this study was to evaluate the role of translational regulation in response to oxygen deprivation (hypoxia).   methods alterations in total cellular and large polysome (>or=five ribosomes per mrna) mrna levels were monitored in response to 12 h of hypoxia stress in seedlings of arabidopsis thaliana with a full-genome oligonucleotide microarray.   key results comparison of two mrna populations revealed considerable modulation of mrna accumulation and diversity in translation in response to hypoxia. consistent with the global decrease in protein synthesis, hypoxia reduced the average proportion of individual mrna species in large polysome complexes from 56.1% to 32.1%. a significant decrease in the association with translational complexes was observed for 77% of the mrnas, including a subset of known hypoxia-induced gene transcripts. the examination of mrna levels of nine genes in polysomes fractionated through sucrose density gradients corroborated the microarray data. gene cluster analysis was used to identify mrnas that displayed co-ordinated regulation. fewer than half of the highly induced mrnas circumvented the global depression of translation. moreover, a large number of mrnas displayed a significant decrease in polysome association without a concomitant decrease in steady-state accumulation. the abundant mrnas that encode the ribosomal proteins behaved in this manner. by contrast, a small group of abiotic and biotic stress-induced mrnas showed a significant increase in polysome association, without a change in abundance. evaluation of quantitative features of mrna sequences demonstrated that a low gc nucleotide content of the 5'-untranslated region provides a selective advantage for translation under hypoxia.   conclusions alterations in transcript abundance and translation contribute to the differential regulation of gene expression in response to oxygen deprivation.
cryptotanshinone, a stat3 inhibitor, suppresses colorectal cancer proliferation and growth in vitro a family of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors, signal transducers and activators of transcription (stats), mediates the responsiveness of cells to several cytokines and growth factors. although mutations of stats have not been described in human tumors, the activity of several members of the family, such as stat1, stat3 and stat5, is deregulated in a variety of human tumors. stat3 and stat5 acquire oncogenic potential through constitutive phosphorylation on tyrosine, and their activity has been shown to be required to sustain a transformed phenotype. disruption of stat3 and stat5 signaling in transformed cells therefore represents an excellent opportunity for targeted cancer therapy. in contrast to stat3 and stat5, stat1 negatively regulates cell proliferation and angiogenesis and thereby inhibits tumor formation. consistent with its tumor suppressive properties, stat1 and its downstream targets have been shown to be reduced in a variety of human tumors and stat1 deficient mice are highly susceptible to tumor formation. in recent years we have gained mechanistic understanding of the pathways whereby stats convey signals from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. in addition, several endogenous regulators of the jak/stat pathway have been described - and their mechanism of action revealed - that profoundly affect signaling by stats. both should greatly facilitate the design of drugs with potential to modulate stat signaling and to restore the homeostasis in tissues where stats have gone awry.
applicability of a segmental bioelectrical impedance analysis for predicting the whole body skeletal muscle volume. this study aimed to investigate the validity of using segmental bioelectrical impedance (bi) analysis for estimating skeletal muscle volume (mv) in the trunk, defined as the body segment from the acromion process to the greater trochanter. using a magnetic resonance imaging (mri) method, the trunk mv was determined in 28 men (19 approximately 34 yr), divided into validation (n = 20) and cross-validation (n = 8) groups, and used as a reference (mv(mri)). for bi measurements of the trunk, the source electrodes were placed at the dorsal surface of the third metacarpal bone of both hands and the dorsal surface of the third metatarsal bone of both feet, and the detector electrodes were placed at the acromion process of both shoulders and the greater trochanter of both femurs. using this arrangement, the bi values of five parts of the trunk, both sides of the upper region, the middle region, and both sides of the lower region, were obtained and then used to calculate the whole trunk bi value and bi index (bi index(tr)). in the validation group, a simple regression analysis of the relationship between bi index(tr) and mv(mri) showed a significant correlation between the two variables (r = 0.884, p < 0.05) and produced a prediction equation with a se of estimation of 1,020.3 cm3 (8.5%). in the validation and cross-validation groups, there were no significant differences between the measured and estimated mv without systematic errors. these findings indicate that the segmental bi analysis employed in the present study can be used to estimate trunk mv.
multi-period classification: learning sequent classes from temporal domains multi-label classification methods are increasingly required by modern applications, such as protein function classification, music categorization, and semantic scene classification. this article introduces the task of multi-label classification, organizes the sparse related literature into a structured presentation and performs comparative experimental results of certain multilabel classification methods. it also contributes the definition of concepts for the quantification of the multi-label nature of a data set.
arbuscular mycorrhiza formation in cordate gametophytes of two ferns, angiopteris lygodiifolia and osmunda japonica many plant species are characterized by a life cycle with a long-lived, subterranean phase that is completely dependent on mycorrhizal fungal symbionts for fixed carbon. this type of life cycle is both phylogenetically and ecologically widespread and is found in diverse vascular plant lineages from the tropics to subalpine meadows. here we report on the molecular identities of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi associated with the autotrophic and underground mycoheterotrophic life cycle phases of the ferns botrychium crenulatum and b. lanceolatum. we show that the glomus taxa found in the mycoheterotrophic life cycle phases of b. crenulatum and b. lanceolatum are also found in conspecific and heterospecific photosynthetic neighboring plants. from our dna sequence data, we infer carbon flow from photosynthetic plants to mycoheterotrophic plants through shared glomalean fungal networks. finally, our phylogenetic analyses identify a major glomus clade that forms associations with mycoheterotrophic life cycle stages of b. crenulatum and b. lanceolatum.
spatial dissimilarities in plankton structure and function during flood pulses in a semi-arid floodplain wetland system hurlbert divides experimental ecologist into ‘those who do not see any need for dispersion (of replicated treatments and controls), and those who do recognize its importance and take whatever measures are necessary to achieve a good dose of it’. experimental ecologists could also be divided into those who do not see any problems with sacrificing spatial and temporal scales in order to obtain replication, and those who understand that appropriate scale must always have priority over replication. if an experiment is conducted in a spatial or temporal scale, where the predictions of contesting hypotheses are convergent or ambiguous, no amount of technical impeccability can make the work instructive. conversely, replication can always be obtained afterwards, by conducting more experiments with basically similar design in different areas and by using meta-analysis. this approach even reduces the sampling bias obtained if resources are allocated to a small number of well-replicated experiments. for a strict advocate of the hypothetico-deductive method, replication is unnecessary even as a matter of principle, unless the predicted response is so weak that random background noise is a plausible excuse for a discrepancy between predictions and results. by definition, a prediction is an ‘all-statement’, referring to all systems within a well-defined category. what applies to all must apply to any. hence, choosing two systems and assigning them randomly to a treatment and a control is normally an adequate design for a deductive experiment. the strength of such experiments depends on the firmness of the predictions and their a priori probability of corroboration. replication is but one of many ways of reducing this probability. whether the experiment is replicated or not, inferential statistics should always be used, to enable the reader to judge how well the apparent patterns in samples reflect real patterns in statistical populations. the concept ‘pseudoreplication’ amounts to entirely unwarranted stigmatization of a reasonable way to test predictions referring to large-scale systems.
exposure to a histone deacetylase inhibitor has detrimental effects on human lymphocyte viability and function classical zinc-dependent histone deacetylases (hdacs) catalyse the removal of acetyl groups from histone tails and also from many non-histone proteins, including the transcription factor foxp3, a key regulator of the development and function of regulatory t cells. many hdac inhibitors are in cancer clinical trials, but a subset of hdac inhibitors has important anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive effects that might be of therapeutic benefit in immuno-inflammatory disorders or post-transplantation. at least some of these effects result from the ability of hdac inhibitors to enhance the production and suppressive functions of foxp3+ regulatory t cells. understanding which hdacs contribute to the regulation of the functions of regulatory t cells may further stimulate the development of new class- or subclass-specific hdac inhibitors with applications beyond oncology.
reactive sc : speculatively relaxing memory consistency model contraints using dynamic classification of cache blocks sequential consistency (sc) is arguably the most intuitive behavior for a shared-memory multithreaded program. it is widely accepted that language-level sc could significantly improve programmability of a multiprocessor system. however, efficiently supporting end-to-end sc remains a challenge as it requires that both compiler and hardware optimizations preserve sc semantics. while a recent study has shown that a compiler can preserve sc semantics for a small performance cost, an efficient and complexity-effective sc hardware remains elusive. past hardware solutions relied on aggressive speculation techniques, which has not yet been realized in a practical implementation. this paper exploits the observation that hardware need not enforce any memory model constraints on accesses to thread-local and shared read-only locations. a processor can easily determine a large fraction of these safe accesses with assistance from static compiler analysis and the hardware memory management unit. we discuss a low-complexity hardware design that exploits this information to reduce the overhead in ensuring sc. our design employs an additional unordered store buffer for fast-tracking thread-local stores and allowing later memory accesses to proceed without a memory ordering related stall. our experimental study shows that the cost of guaranteeing end-to-end sc is only 6.2% on average when compared to a system with tso hardware executing a stock compiler's output.

the radish genome the testa of higher plant seeds protects the embryo against adverse environmental conditions. its role is assumed mainly by controlling germination through dormancy imposition and by limiting the detrimental activity of physical and biological agents during seed storage. to analyze the function of the testa in the model plant arabidopsis, we compared mutants affected in testa pigmentation and/or structure for dormancy, germination, and storability. the seeds of most mutants exhibited reduced dormancy. moreover, unlike wild-type testas, mutant testas were permeable to tetrazolium salts. these altered dormancy and tetrazolium uptake properties were related to defects in the pigmentation of the endothelium and its neighboring crushed parenchymatic layers, as determined by vanillin staining and microscopic observations. structural aberrations such as missing layers or a modified epidermal layer in specific mutants also affected dormancy levels and permeability to tetrazolium. both structural and pigmentation mutants deteriorated faster than the wild types during natural aging at room temperature, with structural mutants being the most strongly affected.
robustness of data-driven cvar optimization using smoothing technique we evaluate conditional value-at-risk (cvar) as a risk measure in data-driven portfolio optimization. we show that portfolios obtained by solving mean-cvar and global minimum cvar problems are unreliable due to estimation errors of cvar and/or the mean, which are magnified by optimization. this problem is exacerbated when the tail of the return distribution is made heavier. we conclude that cvar, a coherent risk measure, is fragile in portfolio optimization due to estimation errors.

oxidative stress in mouse liver caused by dietary amino acid deprivation: protective effect of methionine two-dimensional non-equilibrium ph gel electrophoresis (2d-nephge) analysis was used to evaluate the effects of dietary protein depletion on the protein composition of mouse liver cytosol. analysing the cytosol from both normal and protein depleted liver, the position in gels of more than three hundred protein spots was determined. after 5 days of protein depletion, about 20% of the spots either increased or decreased more than 2 fold. five spots of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) were recognised by specific antibodies. the glutathione s-transferase (gsts) subunits yb1, yc and yf were identified by the simultaneous analysis of both glutathione-binding cytosolic proteins and the corresponding standards. as estimated by internal optical density (iod) of spots, the changes caused by protein depletion in gapdh and gst subunit contents were similar to those obtained by other methods. by means of mass spectrometric analysis of tryptic peptides generated from spots and/or comparison of two-dimensional gel electrophoretic patterns, carbonic anhydrase iii (caiii), cu, zn superoxide dismutase (cuznsod) and a cytochrome p450 cytosolic protein (cyt p450) were identified. these three proteins, as well as gsts, are related with intracellular detoxification and free radical scavenging systems. their contents were regulated by dietary protein restriction in a manner indicative of diminished liver defence against oxidising agents.
anomalous glutamate/alkali cation symport in larval manduca sexta midgut. uptake of tritiated leucine, alanine, and phenylalanine was measured at the physiological ph of 10 by rapid filtration in brush-border membrane vesicles from the midgut of the larval tobacco hornworm, manduca sexta. a 20-fold excess of unlabeled leucine, isoleucine, methionine, valine, alanine, lysine, histidine, phenylalanine, and glutamine inhibited uptake of leucine and phenylalanine, and six of these amino acids inhibited uptake of alanine, by more than 50% both in the presence and absence of a potassium ion gradient. these inhibitory amino acids also drove countertransport of leucine, alanine, and phenylalanine with accumulation ratios exceeding 2. these results are consistent with the hypothesis that leucine, alanine, and phenylalanine share a common uptake system - a broad scope b type symporter - which interacts strongly with half of the commonly occurring amino acids, interacts moderately with an additional quarter of them, but does not interact with cysteine, arginine, glutamate, aspartate, or proline.
targeting bcl-2 with the bh3 mimetic abt-199 in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. backgroundmolecular markers and the rich biological information they contain have great potential for cancer diagnosis, prognostication and therapy prediction. so far, however, they have not superseded routine histopathology and staging criteria, partly because the few studies performed on molecular subtyping have had little validation and limited clinical characterization.methodswe obtained gene expression and clinical data for 412 breast cancers obtained from population-based cohorts of patients from stockholm and uppsala, sweden. using the intrinsic set of approximately 500 genes derived in the norway/stanford breast cancer data, we validated the existence of five molecular subtypes – basal-like, erbb2, luminal a/b and normal-like – and characterized these subtypes extensively with the use of conventional clinical variables.resultswe found an overall 77.5% concordance between the centroid prediction of the swedish cohort by using the norway/stanford signature and the k-means clustering performed internally within the swedish cohort. the highest rate of discordant assignments occurred between the luminal a and luminal b subtypes and between the luminal b and erbb2 subtypes. the subtypes varied significantly in terms of grade (p < 0.001), p53 mutation (p < 0.001) and genomic instability (p = 0.01), but surprisingly there was little difference in lymph-node metastasis (p = 0.31). furthermore, current users of hormone-replacement therapy were strikingly over-represented in the normal-like subgroup (p < 0.001). separate analyses of the patients who received endocrine therapy and those who did not receive any adjuvant therapy supported the previous hypothesis that the basal-like subtype responded to adjuvant treatment, whereas the erbb2 and luminal b subtypes were poor responders.conclusionwe found that the intrinsic molecular subtypes of breast cancer are broadly present in a diverse collection of patients from a population-based cohort in sweden. the intrinsic gene set, originally selected to reveal stable tumor characteristics, was shown to have a strong correlation with progression-related properties such as grade, p53 mutation and genomic instability.
penalized normal likelihood and ridge regularization of correlation and covariance matrices many statistical methods for discriminant analysis do not adapt well or easily to situations where the number of variables is large, possibly even exceeding the number of cases in the training set. we explore a variety of methods for providing robust identiication of future samples in this situation. we develop a range of exible bayesian methods, and primarily a new hierarchical covariance compromise method, akin to regularized discriminant analysis. although the methods are much more widely applicable, the motivating problem was that of discriminating between groups of samples on the basis of their near infrared spectra. here the ability of the bayesian methods to take account of continuity of the spectra may be beneecial. the spectra may consist of absorbances or reeectances at as many as 1000 wavelengths, and yet there may be only tens or hundreds of training samples where both sample spectrum and group identity are known. such problems arise in the food and pharmaceutical industries, for example the authentication of food (eg. detecting the adulteration of orange juice) and the identiication of pharmaceutical drug ingredients. our illustrating example concerns the discrimination of 39 microbiological taxa and 8 aggregate genera. simulations also illustrate the eeectiveness of the hierarchical bayes covariance method. we discuss a number of scoring rules both local and global for judging the t of data to the bayesian models, and adopt a cross-classiicatory approach for estimating hyperparameters.
divided we stand: splitting synthetic cells for their proliferation the three min proteins spatially regulate z ring positioning in escherichia coli and are dynamically associated with the membrane. mind binds to vesicles in the presence of atp and can recruit minc or mine. biochemical and genetic evidence indicate the binding sites for these two proteins on mind overlap. here we solved the structure of a hydrolytic‐deficient mutant of mind truncated for the c‐terminal amphipathic helix involved in binding to the membrane. the structure solved in the presence of atp is a dimer and reveals the face of mind abutting the membrane. using a combination of random and extensive site‐directed mutagenesis additional residues important for mine and minc binding were identified. the location of these residues on the mind structure confirms that the binding sites overlap and reveals that the binding sites are at the dimer interface and exposed to the cytosol. the location of the binding sites at the dimer interface offers a simple explanation for the atp dependence of minc and mine binding to mind.
techniques for shared resource management in systems with throughput processors our analysis shows that many "big-memory" server workloads, such as databases, in-memory caches, and graph analytics, pay a high cost for page-based virtual memory. they consume as much as 10% of execution cycles on tlb misses, even using large pages. on the other hand, we find that these workloads use read-write permission on most pages, are provisioned not to swap, and rarely benefit from the full flexibility of page-based virtual memory.  to remove the tlb miss overhead for big-memory workloads, we propose mapping part of a process's linear virtual address space with a direct segment, while page mapping the rest of the virtual address space. direct segments use minimal hardware---base, limit and offset registers per core---to map contiguous virtual memory regions directly to contiguous physical memory. they eliminate the possibility of tlb misses for key data structures such as database buffer pools and in-memory key-value stores. memory mapped by a direct segment may be converted back to paging when needed.  we prototype direct-segment software support for x86-64 in linux and emulate direct-segment hardware. for our workloads, direct segments eliminate almost all tlb misses and reduce the execution time wasted on tlb misses to less than 0.5%.
improved backpropagation learning in neural networks with windowed momentum while there exist many techniques for finding the parameters that mini- mize an error function, only those methods that solely perform local compu- tations are used in connectionist networks. the most popular learning algo rithm for connectionist networks is the back-propogation procedure [13], which can be used to update the weights by the method of steepest descent. in this paper, we examine steepest descent and analyze why it can be slow to converge. we then propose four heuristics for achieving faster rates of convergence while adhering to the locality constraint. these heuristics suggest that every weight of a network should be given its own learning rate and that these rates should be allowed to vary over time. additionally the heuristics suggest how the learning rates should be adjusted. two implementations of these heuristics, namely momentum and an algorithm called the delta-bar-delta rule, are studied and simulation results are presented.
dysregulation of bet proteins in levodopa-induced dyskinesia basal ganglia disorders are a heterogeneous group of clinical syndromes with a common anatomic locus within the basal ganglia. to account for the variety of clinical manifestations associated with insults to various parts of the basal ganglia we propose a model in which specific types of basal ganglia disorders are associated with changes in the function of subpopulations of striatal projection neurons. this model is based on a synthesis of experimental animal and post-mortem human anatomic and neurochemical data. hyperkinetic disorders, which are characterized by an excess of abnormal movements, are postulated to result from the selective impairment of striatal neurons projecting to the lateral globus pallidus. hypokinetic disorders, such as parkinson's disease, are hypothesized to result from a complex series of changes in the activity of striatal projection neuron subpopulations resulting in an increase in basal ganglia output. this model suggests that the activity of subpopulations of striatal projection neurons is differentially regulated by striatal afferents and that different striatal projection neuron subpopulations may mediate different aspects of motor control.
the bacterial meta-cleavage hydrolase ligy belongs to the amidohydrolase superfamily, not to the α/β-hydrolase superfamily for murine adenosine deaminase, we have determined that a single zinc or cobalt cofactor bound in a high affinity site is required for catalytic function while metal ions bound at an additional site(s) inhibit the enzyme. a catalytically inactive apoenzyme of murine adenosine deaminase was produced by dialysis in the presence of specific zinc chelators in an acidic buffer. this represents the first production of the apoenzyme and demonstrates a rigorous method for removing the occult cofactor. restoration to the holoenzyme is achieved with stoichiometric amounts of either zn2+ or co2+ yielding at least 95% of initial activity. far uv cd and fluorescence spectra are the same for both the apo‐ and holoenzyme, providing evidence that removal of the cofactor does not alter secondary or tertiary structure. the substrate binding site remains functional as determined by similar quenching measured by tryptophan fluorescence of apo‐ or holoenzyme upon mixing with the transition state analog, deoxycoformycin. excess levels of adenosine or n6‐methyladenosine incubated with the apoenzyme prior to the addition of metal prevent restoration, suggesting that the cofactor adds through the substrate binding cleft. the cations ca2+, cd2+ cr2+, cu+, cu2+, mn2+, fe2+, fe3+, pb2+, or mg2+ did not restore adenosine deaminase activity to the apoenzyme. mn2+, cu2+, and zn2+ were found to be competitive inhibitors of the holoenzyme with respect to substrate and cd2+ and co2+ were noncompetitive inhibitors. weak inhibition (ki ≥ 1000 μm) was noted for ca2+, fe2+, and fe3+.
chemobrain experienced by breast cancer survivors: a meta-ethnography study investigating research and care implications aims and objectives to investigate women's awareness of chemotherapy-induced cognitive changes, their perception of cognitive limitations in carrying out daily tasks and subsequent return to work decisions and perceptions of work ability.   background evidence suggests that women diagnosed with breast cancer experience cognitive changes as a consequence of chemotherapy treatment. although these changes tend to be subtle deficits in memory, concentration and the ability to organise information, there has been no published research identifying how they can impact patient's ability to work and subsequent employment decisions.   design this was a qualitative study.   method data were collected from breast cancer survivors using semi-structured interviews with two focus groups (n = 6, n = 7). interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using template analysis.   results data were categorised into four main themes: (1) awareness of cognitive changes during and following chemotherapy, (2) cognitive ability and confidence in return to work, (3) impact of cognitive changes on work ability and (4) information on the cognitive side effects of chemotherapy.   conclusions the views and experiences of breast cancer survivors towards returning to work and subsequent work ability were affected by chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment. more specifically the appraisal of returning to work and ability to manage work were influenced by three interrelated factors: (1) actual cognitive ability following chemotherapy, (2) awareness of cognitive failures by the women and their families and (3) the subsequent impact on their confidence in carrying out daily tasks including work tasks.   relevance to clinical practice more information and support is needed to help patients with cancer to manage chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairments in home and workplace. nurses are increasingly asked about the impact of cancer and its treatment on work and are therefore well positioned to offer this advice. subsequently, nurses require additional knowledge and guidance to provide this information and support.
meiotic resumption in response to luteinizing hormone is independent of a gi family g protein or calcium in the mouse oocyte. de novo synthesis of meiosis activating sterols (mas) was stimulated by lh- and ay-9944 in rat cultured follicles and cumulus oocyte complexes (cocs), but could not be measured in denuded oocytes. thus, mas synthesized by the somatic compartment of the follicle could serve as a signal for the resumption of meiosis. nevertheless, the delay in germinal vesicle breakdown (gvb) after mas or ay-9944 stimulation as compared with gonadotropins, obtained by several groups, remains the strongest evidence against the suggested role of mas as an essential mediator of lh in meiosis resumption. recently several studies using mammalian cocs in culture have implied that steroids, like in fish and amphibians, serve as signals in mediating the lh/hcg stimulation of meiosis. however, in these studies there was no clear distinction between the requirement for steroids for the acquisition of meiotic competence, oocyte and follicle wellbeing or as a signal for meiotic resumption. further, some of the authors overlooked earlier studies showing that blocking ovarian or follicular steroidogenesis does not affect gvb, the first step of meiosis resumption. finally, in vivo and in vitro studies in the rat confirm and extend recent studies showing that locally produced and released egf-like factors, such as epiregulin, seem to mediate at least part of the lh/hcg actions on oocyte maturation and release of ova at ovulation.
evidence of a latitudinal gradient in the age at onset of schizophrenia abstract evidence from nearly a century of epidemiological research indicates that schizophrenia occcurs in all populations with a prevalence in the range of 1.4 to 4.6 per 1000 and incidence rates in the range of 0.16–0.42 per 1000 population. multi-centre studies conducted by the world health organization have highlighted important differences between ‘western’ and ‘third world’ populations as regards the course and outcome of the disorder, with a significantly better prognosis in the developing countries. the factors underlying the better outcome of schizophrenia in developing countries remain essentially unknown but are likely to involve interactions between genetic variation and specific aspects of the environment. these features place schizophrenia, along with diabetes, cancer and hypertension, into the group of genetically complex diseases which are characterised by polygenic transmission, locus heterogeneity and environmental contribution to causation. the emerging pattern of risk factors and antecedents of schizophrenia suggests multiple, mainly quantitative deviations from the average developmental trajectory, primarily in the areas of early neurodevelopment, cognitive ability and social behaviour. these deviations are compatible with the notion of non-specific background factors facilitating the operation of genetically determined causal pathways. research likely to result in new insights should focus on the population distribution and behavioural effects of potential risk factors and markers suggested by biological and genetic research
tendon fascicles exhibit a linear correlation between poisson's ratio and force during uniaxial stress relaxation. a transversely isotropic biphasic mixture model was applied to tendon in uniaxial tension. parametric analyses were performed and the sensitivity in predicting material parameters was evaluated. our results provide quantitative evidence for fluid flow as a mechanism that contributes to tendon viscoelasticity. transversely isotropic material properties were calculated for mouse tail tendon fascicles. the average transverse modulus (e(1)) was 0.046 mpa, the fiber-aligned poisson's ratio (v(31)) was 2.73, and the transverse poisson's ratio [(v(21)) was 0.96; these properties were not strain-dependent. the fiber-aligned modulus (e(s)) was strain-dependent and was 20.7 mpa in the toe region and 86.1 mpa in the linear region. these solid matrix properties were consistent with previously published tendon tissue and fascicle data. the fascicle permeability was strain-dependent and was 5.5 x 10(-18)m(4)/ns in the toe region and 0.32 x 10(-18)m(4)/ns in the linear region, similar to previously reported meniscus permeability in tension. the similar permeabilities of both fascicle and tissue-level samples suggest that fluid flow from individual fascicles, not the packing of multiple fascicles together, may be the primary barrier to fluid flow in tendon and thus the primary mechanism for viscoelasticity.
nonosmotic release of vasopressin and renal aquaporins in impaired urinary dilution in hypothyroidism. the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of thyroid status on the na,k-atpase alpha isoforms and beta in rat heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and brain at the levels of mrna, protein abundance, and enzymatic activity. northern and dot-blot analysis of rna (euthyroid, hypothyroid, and triiodothyronine-injected hypothyroids = hyperthyroids) and immunoblot analysis of protein (euthyroid and hypothyroid) revealed isoform-specific regulation of na,k-atpase by thyroid status in kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle and no regulation of sodium pump subunit levels in the brain. in general, in the transition from euthyroid to hypothyroid alpha 1 mrna and protein levels are unchanged in kidney and skeletal muscle and slightly decreased in heart, while alpha 2 mrna and protein are decreased significantly in heart and skeletal muscle. in hypothyroid heart and skeletal muscle, the decrease in alpha 2 protein levels was much greater than the decrease in alpha 2 mrna levels relative to euthyroid indicating translational or post-translational regulation of alpha 2 protein abundance by triiodothyronine status in these tissues. the regulation of beta subunit by thyroid status is tissue-dependent. in hypothyroid kidney beta mrna levels do not change, but immunodetectable beta protein levels decrease relative to euthyroid, and the decrease parallels the decrease in na,k-atpase activity. in hypothyroid heart and skeletal muscle beta mrna levels decrease; beta protein decreases in heart and was not detected in the skeletal muscle. these findings demonstrate that the euthyroid levels of expression of alpha 1 in heart, alpha 2 in heart and skeletal muscle, and beta in kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle are dependent on the presence of thyroid hormone.
patient-reported outcomes from a randomized phase iii trial of sarilumab monotherapy versus adalimumab monotherapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis objective morning stiffness (ms) is a common problem for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra). however the clinical evaluation of the symptom has proved to be difficult. the aim of the study was to determine the responsiveness of two methods for measuring ms.   methods data from an uncontrolled (n = 63) and a controlled study (n = 80) of inpatient multidisciplinary team care for ra were analyzed. ms was measured by its duration to maximum improvement and by its severity on a visual analog scale (vas). the responsiveness of both assessment methods was computed by calculating effect sizes and t-statistics, and by receiver operating characteristic (roc) curves with clinical improvement according to the definition of the american college of rheumatology as an external criterion.   results with respect to the ability to detect a clinical improvement between admission and discharge in the uncontrolled study, and a difference in improvement between the treatment and the control group in the controlled study, the effect sizes and t-values of the vas for severity of ms were consistently higher than those of the duration of ms. in contrast to the duration, the responsiveness of the vas for ms compared favorably with the responsiveness of other endpoint measures. the roc surface area of the vas was higher than that of the duration.   conclusion for the evaluation of ms in ra clinical trials, the assessment of ms by a severity score is more responsive than one based on duration and compares favorably with the performance of other endpoint measures.
comparative genomics allows the discovery of cis-regulatory elements in mosquitoes blood feeding tightly regulates the reproductive cycle in anautogenous mosquitoes. vitellogenesis (the synthesis of yolk protein precursors) is a key event in the mosquito reproductive cycle and is activated in response to a blood meal. before blood feeding, aedes aegypti is in a state of reproductive arrest during which the yolk protein precursor genes (ypps) are repressed. the regulatory region of the major ypp gene vitellogenin (vg) has multiple gata-binding sites required for the high expression level of this gene. however, a gata factor (aagatar) likely acts as a repressor, preventing activation of this gene before a blood meal. here we report in vivo data confirming the role of aagatar as a repressor of the vg gene at the state of previtellogenic arrest. using an rna interference (rnai)-mediated technique in conjunction with the sindbis viral expression system, we show that knockdown of the aagatar gene results in an increased basal level of expression of the vg gene and an elevated response to the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone in mosquitoes in a state of arrest. these experiments have revealed a component in the molecular mechanism by which anautogeny is maintained in a. aegypti.
using molecular data to detect selection: signatures from recent single events the selection response of a complex maize population improved primarily for quantitative disease resistance to northern leaf blight (nlb) and secondarily for common rust resistance and agronomic phenotypes was investigated at the molecular genetic level. a tiered marker analysis with 151 simple sequence repeat (ssr) markers in 90 individuals of the population indicated that on average six alleles per locus were available for selection. an improved test statistic for selection mapping was developed, in which quantitative trait loci (qtl) are identified through the analysis of allele-frequency shifts at mapped multiallelic loci over generations of selection. after correcting for the multiple tests performed, 25 ssr loci showed evidence of selection. many of the putatively selected loci were unlinked and dispersed across the genome, which was consistent with the diffuse distribution of previously published qtl for nlb resistance. compelling evidence for selection was found on maize chromosome 8, where several putatively selected loci colocalized with published nlb qtl and a race-specific resistance gene. analysis of f2 populations derived from the selection mapping population suggested that multiple linked loci in this chromosomal segment were, in part, responsible for the selection response for quantitative resistance to nlb.
interleukin-17 causes rho-kinase-mediated endothelial dysfunction and hypertension. chronic treatment with the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin leads to hypertension; however, the mechanisms are unknown. rapamycin binds fk506 binding protein 12 and its related isoform 12.6 (fkbp12/12.6) and displaces them from intracellular ca release channels (ryanodine receptors) eliciting a ca leak from the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum. we tested whether this ca leak promotes conventional protein kinase c–mediated endothelial no synthase phosphorylation at thr495, which reduces production of the vasodilator no. rapamycin treatment of control mice for 7 days, as well as genetic deletion of fkbp12.6, increased systolic arterial pressure significantly compared with controls. untreated aortas from fkbp12.6 / mice and in vitro rapamycin-treated control aortas had similarly decreased endothelium-dependent relaxation responses and no production and increased endothelial no synthase thr495 phosphorylation and protein kinase c activity. inhibition of either conventional protein kinase c or ryanodine receptor restored endothelial no synthase thr495 phosphorylation and endothelial function to control levels. rapamycin induced a small increase in basal intracellular ca levels in isolated endothelial cells, and rapamycin or fkbp12.6 gene deletion decreased acetylcholine-induced intracellular ca release, all of which were reversed by ryanodine. these data demonstrate that displacement of fkbp12/12.6 from ryanodine receptors induces an endothelial intracellular ca leak and increases conventional protein kinase c–mediated endothelial no synthase thr495 phosphorylation leading to decreased no production and endothelial dysfunction. this molecular mechanism may, in part, explain rapamycin-induced hypertension.

male-specific molecular genetic markers in the japanese subterranean termite reticulitermes speratus it is difficult to identify sex in many species of eukaryotic organism. this can considerably impede research into their biology. fortunately, one sex often possesses a unique chromosome termed y or w. when dna markers are available for these chromosomes, then sex identification becomes straightforward. we describe a technique that facilitates the isolation of such markers. the procedure makes use of low-stringency pcr to screen randomly selected primers for their ability to amplify sex-specific loci.
magnetic resonance imaging for rapid screening for the nephrotoxic and hepatotoxic effects of microcystins the microcystins (mcs) lr and yr are hepatotoxins produced by some species of freshwater cyanobacteria. only a few reports on the acute nephrotoxicity of mcs have been published to date. here we investigate the effects on rat kidneys of chronic administration of relatively low doses of mc lr and mc yr. male wistar rats were injected every second day for 8 months with mc lr (10 microg/kg i.p., n=5) and mc yr (10 microg/kg i.p., n=5). the control group was treated with vehicle, a mixture containing 0.8 % ethanol and 0.2 % methanol in 0.9 % saline (3.7 ml/kg i.p., n=5). we found that mcs could induce damage to the kidney cortex and medulla. the lesions mainly consisted of damaged and dilated tubuli filled with homogenous eosinophil material. we conclude that long-term exposure to relatively low doses of mcs poses a considerable risk for kidney injury.
a genetic association study of dna methylation levels in the drd4 gene region finds associations with nearby snps one of the major challenges in genetics today is to understand the causes of complex genetic diseases. the genes involved in these disorders are thought to interact with poorly-defined environmental factors to exert their phenotypic effects. an emerging view is that epigenetics also plays a role in complex diseases. here we review the evidence that epigenetic regulatory mediators can be influenced by several environmental factors, that variability of the epigenome can cause variation in phenotypes, and that epigenetic dysregulation can be heritable across generations. assays that map epigenetic regulatory patterns across the whole genome have recently become available, which enable us to explore the epigenomic influences on complex diseases, thus offering new avenues for diagnostic biomarker development and therapeutic strategies.
embryonic overexpression of receptors for advanced glycation end-products by alveolar epithelium induces an imbalance between proliferation and apoptosis. the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 gene is differentially spliced to encode two transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor proteins that have different ligand-binding specificities and exclusive tissue distributions. we have used cre-mediated excision to generate mice lacking the iiib form of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 whilst retaining expression of the iiic form. fibroblast growth factor receptor 2(iiib) null mice are viable until birth, but have severe defects of the limbs, lung and anterior pituitary gland. the development of these structures appears to initiate, but then fails with the tissues undergoing extensive apoptosis. there are also developmental abnormalities of the salivary glands, inner ear, teeth and skin, as well as minor defects in skull formation. our findings point to a key role for fibroblast growth factor receptor 2(iiib) in mesenchymal-epithelial signalling during early organogenesis.
intercellular signaling pathways in the initiation of mammalian forebrain development in vertebrates, nodal-related genes are crucial for specifying mesendodermal cell fates. six nodal-related genes have been identified in xenopus, but only one, nodal, has been identified in the mouse. the xenopus nodal-related gene 3 (xnr3), however, lacks the mesoderm-inducing activity of the other five nodal-related genes in xenopus, and can directly induce neural tissue in animal caps by antagonizing bmp signals. in this study, we isolated three clones of the xenopus (silurana) tropicalis nodal-related gene 3 (xtnr3) and analyzed their function. the xtnr3 genes show high homology to xnr3 and have the same activity. southern blot and genomic pcr analyses indicate that the x. tropicalis genome has duplications in the xtnr3 gene sequences and our three clones represent separate gene loci. we also found a partial clone of xtnr3 that coded for the n-terminal part of its pro-region. surprisingly, this sequence also induced neural tissue by antagonizing bmp signals, and its coded protein physically associated with bmp4 mature protein. furthermore, we showed that the pro-region of xnr5 has the same activity. together, these findings indicate that the pro-region of nodal-related genes acts antagonistically towards bmp signals, which identifies a novel mechanism for the inhibition of bmp signaling.
internalization and cytotoxicity of graphene oxide and carboxyl graphene nanoplatelets in the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line hep g2 mesoporous carbon nanospheres (mcns) with small diameters of ≈90 nm are developed as an efficient transmembrane delivery vehicle of an anticancer drug, doxorubicin (dox). mcns exhibit a high loading capacity toward dox due to hydrophobic interactions and the supramolecular π stacking between dox and the carbonaceous structures, on which the ph-dependent drug release are successfully achieved. specifically, dox can be loaded onto mcns in basic solution and in a physiological ph range, while release occurs in acidic solution in its ionized state. by effective passive and active targeting, mcns can be readily internalized into hela cells, where the carried dox can be efficiently released in the acidic microenvironment of the tumors for further therapy. the endocytosis and cytotoxicity of dox@mcns toward hela cells are investigated by confocal microscopy and mtt assay. this smart ph-dependent drug loading and release property of dox@mcns makes it possible to reduce the cytotoxicity to normal tissues during circulation in the body since the normal physiological ph is ≈7.4.
number of aberrant crypt foci associated with adiposity and igf1 bioavailability there is increasing evidence that dysregulation of energy homeostasis is associated with colorectal carcinogenesis. epidemiological data have consistently demonstrated a positive relation between increased body size and colorectal malignancy, whereas mechanistic studies have sought to uncover obesity-related carcinogenic pathways. the phenomenon of "insulin resistance" or the impaired ability to normalize plasma glucose levels has formed the core of these pathways, but other mechanisms have also been advanced. obesity-induced insulin resistance leads to elevated levels of plasma insulin, glucose and fatty acids. exposure of the colonocyte to heightened concentrations of insulin may induce a mitogenic effect within these cells, whereas exposure to glucose and fatty acids may induce metabolic perturbations, alterations in cell signaling pathways and oxidative stress. the importance of chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of obesity has recently been highlighted and may represent an additional mechanism linking increased adiposity to colorectal carcinogenesis. this review provides an overview of the epidemiology of body size and colorectal neoplasia and outlines current knowledge of putative mechanisms advanced to explain this relation. family based studies have shown that the propensity to become obese is heritable, but this is only manifest in conditions of excess energy intake over expenditure. inheritance of a genetic profile that predisposes to increased body size may also be predictive of colorectal cancer. genomewide scans, linkage studies and candidate gene investigations have highlighted more than 400 chromosomal regions that may harbor variants that predispose to increased body size. the genetics underlying the pathogenesis of obesity are likely to be complex, but variants in a range of different genes have already been associated with increased body size and insulin resistance. these include genes encoding elements of insulin signaling, adipocyte metabolism and differentiation, and regulation of energy expenditure. a number of investigators have begun to study genetic variants within these pathways in relation to colorectal neoplasia, but at present data remain limited to a handful of studies. these pathways will be discussed with particular reference to genetic polymorphisms that have been associated with obesity and insulin resistance.
virtual direction routing for overlay networks hash tables - which map "keys" onto "values" - are an essential building block in modern software systems. we believe a similar functionality would be equally valuable to large distributed systems. in this paper, we introduce the concept of a content-addressable network (can) as a distributed infrastructure that provides hash table-like functionality on internet-like scales. the can is scalable, fault-tolerant and completely self-organizing, and we demonstrate its scalability, robustness and low-latency properties through simulation.
a case of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy without arrhythmias arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (arvc/d) is a heart muscle disease clinically characterized by life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. its prevalence has been estimated to vary from 1:2,500 to 1:5,000. arvc/d is a major cause of sudden death in the young and athletes. the pathology consists of a genetically determined dystrophy of the right ventricular myocardium with fibro-fatty replacement to such an extent that it leads to right ventricular aneurysms. the clinical picture may include: a subclinical phase without symptoms and with ventricular fibrillation being the first presentation; an electrical disorder with palpitations and syncope, due to tachyarrhythmias of right ventricular origin; right ventricular or biventricular pump failure, so severe as to require transplantation. the causative genes encode proteins of mechanical cell junctions (plakoglobin, plakophilin, desmoglein, desmocollin, desmoplakin) and account for intercalated disk remodeling. familiar occurrence with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and variable penetrance has been proven. recessive variants associated with palmoplantar keratoderma and woolly hair have been also reported. clinical diagnosis may be achieved by demonstrating functional and structural alterations of the right ventricle, depolarization and repolarization abnormalities, arrhythmias with the left bundle branch block morphology and fibro-fatty replacement through endomyocardial biopsy. two dimensional echo, angiography and magnetic resonance are the imaging tools for visualizing structural-functional abnormalities. electroanatomic mapping is able to detect areas of low voltage corresponding to myocardial atrophy with fibro-fatty replacement. the main differential diagnoses are idiopathic right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia, myocarditis, dialted cardiomyopathy and sarcoidosis. only palliative therapy is available and consists of antiarrhythmic drugs, catheter ablation and implantable cardioverter defibrillator. young age, family history of juvenile sudden death, qrs dispersion ≥ 40 ms, t-wave inversion, left ventricular involvement, ventricular tachycardia, syncope and previous cardiac arrest are the major risk factors for adverse prognosis. preparticipation screening for sport eligibility has been proven to be effective in detecting asymptomatic patients and sport disqualification has been life-saving, substantially declining sudden death in young athletes.
experimental diabetes attenuates cerebral cortical-evoked forelimb motor responses. aims/hypothesisthe pathogenesis of painful diabetic neuropathy remains unknown. as a consequence we still do not have any effective, rational treatments and a greater understanding of the mechanisms is urgently required. previous studies have shown no consistent morphological differences in the nerves of patients with and without painful neuropathy. the aim of this study was to compare epineurial haemodynamics in patients with chronic painful and painless neuropathy.methodsthe techniques of microlightguide spectrophotometry and fluorescein angiography were used to measure epineurial intravascular oxygen saturation and blood flow respectively. eleven patients with painful and eight with painless neuropathy were studied, with the groups matched carefully in terms of severity of neuropathy and diabetes control.resultsintravascular oxygen saturation was higher in the painful neuropathy group compared to those without pain (median 73.8% vs 67.7%, respectively; p=0.021). fluorescein rise time was also faster in those with painful symptoms (median 18.3 s vs 53.6 s; p=0.046) indicating higher epineurial blood flow in these subjects.conclusion/interpretationthese results indicate that there are distinct differences in haemodynamics within the epineurium of the sural nerve in subjects with painful and painless neuropathy. haemodynamic factors could therefore have an important role in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain and might offer further insight into potential treatments for this distressing condition.
evolution of crisps associated with toxicoferan-reptilian venom and mammalian reproduction. in studies of blood coagulation and the vascular system, snake venom toxins have been indispensable in elucidating the complex physiological mechanisms that govern coagulation and the vascular system in mammals, given their potency and highly specific biological effects. the various components of snake venom toxins can be classified according to their mechanism of action, for example, serine proteases, metalloproteinases, kunitz-type protease inhibitors, phospholipases a(2), (l)-amino acid oxidases, c-type lectin(-like) proteins, disintegrins, vascular endothelial growth factors, three-finger toxins, and cysteine-rich secretory proteins. although the molecular structures of most toxins are not unique to snake venom toxins, venom proteins often exhibit marked diversity in their biological effects, despite their structural similarities. in this review, we identify several snake venom toxins capable of affecting blood coagulation and the vascular system, as well as various toxins from other organisms, including leeches and ticks.
acylcarnitine esters profiling of serum and follicular fluid in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization carnitine was detected at the beginning of this century, but it was nearly forgotten among biochemists until its importance in fatty acid metabolism was established 50 years later. in the last 30 years, interest in the metabolism and functions of carnitine has steadily increased. carnitine is synthesized in most eucaryotic organisms, although a few insects (and most likely some newborn animals) require it as a nutritional factor (vitamin bt). carnitine biosynthesis is initiated by methylation of lysine. the trimethyllysine formed is subsequently converted to butyrobetaine in all tissues; the butyrobetaine is finally hydroxylated to carnitine in the liver and, in some animals, in the kidneys (see fig. 1). it is released from these tissues and is then actively taken up by all other tissues. the turnover of carnitine in the body is slow, and the regulation of its synthesis is still incompletely understood. microorganisms (e.g., in the intestine) can metabolize carnitine to trimethylamine, dehydrocarnitine (beta-keto-gamma-trimethylaminobutyric acid), betaine, and possibly to trimethylaminoacetone. in some insects carnitine can be converted to methylcholine, presumably with trimethylaminoacetone as an intermediate (see fig. 3). in mammals the unphysiological isomer (+) carnitine is converted to trimethylaminoacetone. the natural isomer (-)carnitine is excreted unchanged in the urine, and it is still uncertain if it is degraded in mammalian tissues at all (fig. 2). the only firmly established function of carnitine is its function as a carrier of activated fatty acids and activated acetate across the inner mitochondrial membrane. two acyl-coa:carnitine acyltransferases with overlapping chain-length specificities have been isolated: one acetyltransferase taking part in the transport of acetyl and short-chain acyl groups and one palmitoyltransferase taking part in the transport of long-chain acyl groups. an additional octanoyltransferase has been isolated from liver peroxisomes. although a carnitine translocase that allows carnitine and acylcarnitine to penetrate the inner mitochondrial membrane has been deduced from functional studies (see fig. 5), this translocase has not been isolated as a protein separate from the acyltransferases. carnitine acetyltransferase and carnitine octanoyltransferase are also found in the peroxisomes. in these organelles the enzymes may be important in the transfer of acyl groups, which are produced by the peroxisomal beta-oxidation enzymes, to the mitochondria for oxidation in the citric acid cycle. the carnitine-dependent transport of activated fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane is a regulated process. malonyl-coa inh
intracellular uptake of an antitumor-active azole-bridged dinuclear platinum(ii) complex in cisplatin-resistant tumor cells the accidental discovery of the anticancer properties of cisplatin and its clinical introduction in the 1970s represent a major landmark in the history of successful anticancer drugs. although carboplatin — a second-generation analogue that is safer but shows a similar spectrum of activity to cisplatin — was introduced in the 1980s, the pace of further improvements slowed for many years. however, in the past several years interest in platinum drugs has increased. key developments include the elucidation of mechanisms of tumour resistance to these drugs, the introduction of new platinum-based agents (oxaliplatin, satraplatin and picoplatin), and clinical combination studies using platinum drugs with resistance modulators or new molecularly targeted drugs.
transcriptional analysis of penaeus stylirostris densovirus genes. over 99% of the genome of aedes densonucleosis virus was determined. two types of the viral dna were found that differ only in four nucleotides (nt) in the 5' noncoding part and whose sizes are 4009 nt (more copious) and 4012 nt, respectively. both 146 nt at the 3' end and 164 nt at the 5' end could assume a similar t-shaped structure; but unlike the adeno-associated virus, aedes dna has a unique primary dna sequence at each terminus. however, the crossarms of these structures are built of the same sequences. an imperfect direct repeat of 34 nt was observed in the 5' noncoding part. the plus strand has three large open reading frames (orf): a left orf, a right orf, and a mid orf (within the left orf). the left orf codes for the nonstructural protein ns-1 (97.5k) featured by an ntp-binding domain, and the right orf encodes the both capsid proteins, the smaller of which (39k) is supposed to be derived from the larger one (40.5k) by proteolytic cleavage. there is also an orf in the minus strand. the putative polypeptide coded by this orf is extremely hydrophobic.
response suppression in v1 agrees with psychophysics of surround masking contrast masking was studied psychophysically. a two-alternative forced-choice procedure was used to measure contrast thresholds for 2.0 cpd sine-wave gratings in the presence of masking sine-wave gratings. thresholds were measured for 11 masker contrasts spanning three log units, and seven masker frequencies ranging +/- one octave from the signal frequency. corresponding measurements were made for gratings with horizontal widths of 0.75 degrees (narrow fields) and 6.0 degrees (wide fields). for high contrast maskers at all frequencies, signal thresholds were related to masking contrast by power functions with exponents near 0.6. for a range of low masking contrasts, signal thresholds were reduced by the masker. for the wide fields, high contrast masking tuning functions peaked at the signal frequency, were slightly asymmetric, and had approximately invariant half-maximum frequencies that lie 3/4 octave below and 1 octave above the signal frequency. the corresponding low contrast tuning functions exhibited peak threshold reduction at the signal frequency, with half-minimum frequencies at roughly +/- 0.25 octaves. for the narrow fields, the masking tuning functions were much broader at both low and high masking contrasts. a masking model is presented that encompasses contrast detection, discrimination, and masking phenomena. central constructs of the model include a linear spatial frequency filter, a nonlinear transducer, and a process of spatial pooling that acts at low contrasts only.
higher education dominance and siloed knowledge: a systematic review of flipped classroom research recent calls for educational reform highlight ongoing concerns about the ability of current curricula to equip aspiring health care professionals with the skills for success. whereas a wide range of proposed solutions attempt to address apparent deficiencies in current educational models, a growing body of literature consistently points to the need to rethink the traditional in-class, lecture-based course model. one such proposal is the flipped classroom, in which content is offloaded for students to learn on their own, and class time is dedicated to engaging students in student-centered learning activities, like problem-based learning and inquiry-oriented strategies. in 2012, the authors flipped a required first-year pharmaceutics course at the university of north carolina eshelman school of pharmacy. they offloaded all lectures to self-paced online videos and used class time to engage students in active learning exercises. in this article, the authors describe the philosophy and methodology used to redesign the basic pharmaceutics ii course and outline the research they conducted to investigate the resulting outcomes. this article is intended to serve as a guide to instructors and educational programs seeking to develop, implement, and evaluate innovative and practical strategies to transform students’ learning experience. as class attendance, students’ learning, and the perceived value of this model all increased following participation in the flipped classroom, the authors conclude that this approach warrants careful consideration as educators aim to enhance learning, improve outcomes, and fully equip students to address 21st-century health care needs.
sortie précoce en post-partum: résultats et facteurs de risque de ré hospitalization a family-centered perinatal-care program featuring collaboration by nurse practitioners, obstetricians, pediatricians, and paramedical personnel was developed to enhance family participation and achieve a shorter but safe hospital stay. discharge from the hospital was permitted as early as 12 hours after delivery. a perinatal nurse practitioner made daily home visits. the program's safety, feasibility, and acceptability to patients was studied by comparison of 44 patients so treated (study group) with 44 receiving traditional care (controls). twenty-one study families, but no controls, went home within 24 hours. the study and control groups had no significant differences or trends in numbers of types of morbidity during hospitalization or the six-week post-partum period. the expense of the program is approximately equaled by hospital costs saved through early discharge. the results indicate that early discharge with home-care follow-up observation as described is safe, economically feasible, and well accepted by patients.
a novel feeder-free system for human embryonic stem cells and characterization of their sublines with autogenic and allogenic cultivation human pluripotent stem cells hold promising potential in many therapeutics applications including regenerative medicine and drug discovery. over the past three decades, embryonic stem cell research has illustrated that embryonic stem cells possess two important and distinct properties: the ability to continuously self-renew and the ability to differentiate into all specialized cell types. in this article, we will discuss the continuing evolution of human pluripotent stem cell culture by examining requirements needed for the maintenance of self-renewal in vitro. we will also elaborate on the future direction of the field toward generating a robust and completely defined culture system, which has brought forth collaborations amongst biologists and engineers. as human pluripotent stem cell research progresses towards identifying solutions for debilitating diseases, it will be critical to establish a defined, reproducible and scalable culture system to meet the requirements of these clinical applications.
gregarious sexual segregation: the unusual social organization of the malagasy narrow-striped mongoose (mungotictis decemlineata) the diversity of extant carnivores provides valuable opportunities for comparative research to illuminate general patterns of mammalian social evolution. recent field studies on mongooses (herpestidae), in particular, have generated detailed behavioural and demographic data allowing tests of assumptions and predictions of theories of social evolution. the first studies of the social systems of their closest relatives, the malagasy eupleridae, also have been initiated. the literature on mongooses was last reviewed over 25 years ago. in this review, we summarise the current state of knowledge on the social organisation, mating systems and social structure (especially competition and cooperation) of the two mongoose families. our second aim is to evaluate the contributions of these studies to a better understanding of mammalian social evolution in general. based on published reports or anecdotal information, we can classify 16 of the 34 species of herpestidae as solitary and nine as group‐living; there are insufficient data available for the remainder. there is a strong phylogenetic signal of sociality with permanent complex groups being limited to the genera crossarchus, helogale, liberiictis, mungos, and suricata. our review also indicates that studies of solitary and social mongooses have been conducted within different theoretical frameworks: whereas solitary species and transitions to gregariousness have been mainly investigated in relation to ecological determinants, the study of social patterns of highly social mongooses has instead been based on reproductive skew theory. in some group‐living species, group size and composition were found to determine reproductive competition and cooperative breeding through group augmentation. infanticide risk and inbreeding avoidance connect social organisation and social structure with reproductive tactics and life histories, but their specific impact on mongoose sociality is still difficult to evaluate. however, the level of reproductive skew in social mongooses is not only determined by the costs and benefits of suppressing each other's breeding attempts, but also influenced by resource abundance. thus, dispersal, as a consequence of eviction, is also linked to the costs of co‐breeding in the context of food competition. by linking these facts, we show that the socio‐ecological model and reproductive skew theory share some determinants of social patterns. we also conclude that due to their long bio‐geographical isolation and divergent selection pressures, future studies of the social systems of the eupleridae will be of great value for the elucidation of general patterns in carnivore social evolution.
intradural prostate carcinoma metastatic lesion mimicking an exophytic ependymoma: case report the management of 10 patients with symptomatic localized intradural extramedullary spinal metastasis is reviewed. the single most common primary source was carcinoma of the breast (four cases). the initial symptom in nine patients was pain, with five patients reporting a characteristically severe cramping discomfort with radicular distribution. all patients underwent laminectomy decompression. at the time of surgery, six of the patients were weak but ambulatory and four were bedridden. following surgery, four patients enjoyed some measure of pain relief, seven patients became ambulatory, and three remained bedridden. two patients achieved a "satisfactory" result, and were walking and continent 6 months after surgery. secondary brain tumors were demonstrated or implicated in nine patients, supporting the concept that the spinal metastases represented tertiary deposits following dissemination via the cerebrospinal fluid. symptomatic intradural extramedullary spinal metastasis causes a virulent clinical syndrome with poor prognosis and disappointing outcome after treatment. given the high incidence of associated cerebral metastatic involvement, total neuraxis radiation and/or chemotherapy should be considered when symptomatic spinal metastasis is discovered to be intradural and extramedullary.
testing for relationships between individual crab behavior and metabolic rate across ecological contexts summary repeatability studies are gaining considerable interest among physiological ecologists, particularly in traits affected by high environmental/residual variance, such as whole-animal metabolic rate (mr). the original definition of repeatability, known as the intraclass correlation coefficient, is computed from the components of variance obtained in a one-way anova on several individuals from which two or more measurements are performed. an alternative estimation of repeatability, popular among physiological ecologists, is the pearson product–moment correlation between two consecutive measurements. however, despite the more than 30 studies reporting repeatability of mr, so far there is not a definite synthesis indicating: (1) whether repeatability changes in different types of animals; (2) whether some kinds of metabolism are more repeatable than others; and most important, (3) whether metabolic rate is significantly repeatable. we performed a meta-analysis to address these questions, as well as to explore the historical trend in repeatability studies. our results show that metabolic rate is significantly repeatable and its effect size is not statistically affected by any of the mentioned factors (i.e. repeatability of mr does not change in different species, type of metabolism, time between measurements, and number of individuals). the cumulative meta-analysis revealed that repeatability studies in mr have already reached an asymptotical effect size with no further change either in its magnitude and/or variance (i.e. additional studies will not contribute significantly to the estimator). there was no evidence of strong publication bias.
high spatial resolution free-breathing 3d late gadolinium enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in ischaemic and non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy: quantitative assessment of scar mass and image quality to compare higher spatial resolution 3d late gadolinium enhancement (lge) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (cardiac mr) with 2d lge in patients with prior myocardial infarction.
phylogeny of linearia and notata groups of paspalum l. (poaceae, panicoideae, paniceae) and related species phylogenetic analyses of four plastid dna regions, the rbcl exon, trnl intron, trnl-trnf intergenic spacer, and rps16 intron from each of 73 species in the african genus moraea (iridaceae: irideae) including accessions of all major species clusters in the genus, show moraea to be paraphyletic when barnardiella, galaxia, hexaglottis, homeria (all southern african), and gynandriris (eurasian as well) were recognized as separate genera. there are several small, isolated species clusters at the basal nodes of the tree that are all restricted to the winter-rainfall zone of southern africa (the greater cape floral kingdom) and a few, highly derived, large species groups that have radiated extensively within the winter-rainfall zone. mapping of floral traits shows that an iris-type flower is ancestral in moraea. floral changes are associated with shifts in pollination systems, either from passive pollen deposition on long-tongued bees foraging for nectar to active pollen collection by female bees foraging for pollen, fly, or hopliine scarab beetle pollination. dating the nodes of the phylogenetic tree using non-parametric rate smoothing with a calibration point derived from broad dating of the angiosperms indicates that the divergence between moraea and its sister genus ferraria occurred about 25 mya in the early miocene. the early radiation of moraea took place against a background of aridification and the spread of open habitats, such as desert, shrubland, and fynbos.
longitudinal study in 3,000 m male runners: relationship between performance and selected physiological parameters. one of the most fundamental beliefs in exercise physiology is that performance during maximum exercise of short duration is limited by the inability of the heart and lungs to provide oxygen at a rate sufficiently fast to fuel energy production by the active muscle mass. this belief originates from work undertaken in the 1920's by hill and lupton. a result is that most, if not all, of the studies explaining the effects of exercise training or detraining or other interventions on human physiology explain these changes in terms either of central adaptations increasing oxygen delivery to muscle or of peripheral adaptations that modify the rates of oxygen or fuel utilization by the active muscles. yet a critical review of hill and lupton's results shows that they inferred but certainly did not prove that oxygen limitation develops during maximal exercise. furthermore, more modern studies suggest that, if such an oxygen limitation does indeed occur during maximal exercise, it develops in about 50% of test subjects. thus, an alternative mechanism may need to be evoked to explain exhaustion during maximal exercise in a rather large group of subjects. this review proposes that the factors limiting maximal exercise performance might be better explained in terms of a failure of muscle contractility ("muscle power"), which may be independent of tissue oxygen deficiency. the implications for exercise testing and the prediction of athletic performance are discussed.
the crucial role of multiomic approach in cancer research and clinically relevant outcomes the intact yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) tetramer of 147 kda was introduced into a fticr mass spectrometer by native electrospray. electron capture dissociation of the entire 23+ to 27+ charge state distribution produced the expected charge-reduced ions and, more unexpectedly, 39 c-type peptide fragments that identified n-terminus acetylation and the first 55 amino acids. the results are in accord with the crystal structure of yeast adh, which shows that the c-terminus is buried at the assembly interface, whereas the n-terminus is exposed, allowing ecd to occur. this remarkable observation shows promise that a top-down approach for intact protein assemblies will be effective for characterizing their components, inferring their interfaces, and obtaining both proteomics and structural biology information in one experiment.
a novel uplc–ms–ms method for simultaneous determination of seven uremic retention toxins with cardiovascular relevance in chronic kidney disease patients background stage 5 chronic kidney disease (ckd) is associated with enhanced aortic calcification. the aim of this study was to determine if the administration of indoxyl sulphate (is), a uraemic toxin, stimulates the progression of aortic calcification.   methods the rat groups consisted of (i) dahl salt-resistant normotensive rats (dr) with intake of 0.3% salt, (ii) dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive rats (ds) with intake of 2.0% salt and (iii) dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive is-administered rats (ds-is) with intake of 2.0% salt and 200 mg/kg of is in water. after 30 weeks, their aortic and kidney tissues were excised for histological and immunohistochemical analyses.   results severe vascular calcification was observed by von kossa staining in the arcuate aorta of all the ds-is rats, but hardly in ds or dr rats. immunohistochemistry demonstrated that osteopontin, core binding factor 1 (cbfal), alkaline phosphatase (alp), osteocalcin, is and organic anion transporter (oat) 3 were colocalized in the cells embedded in the aortic calcification area of ds-is rats. wall thickness was significantly increased in arcuate, thoracic and abdominal aortas of ds-is rats compared with ds and dr rats. ds-is rats showed significantly increased extent of glomerular hypertrophy, mesangial expansion, masson's trichrome-positive tubulointerstitial area and glomerular and tubulointerstitial expression of transforming growth factor-ssl as compared with ds and dr rats.   conclusions is induced aortic calcification with expression of osteoblast-specific proteins and aortic wall thickening. is is not only a nephrotoxin but also a vascular toxin, and may contribute to the progression of aortic calcification in stage 5 ckd patients.
deletion of the eif2α kinase gcn2 fails to rescue the memory decline associated with alzheimer’s disease β-site app-cleaving enzyme 1 (bace1) initiates amyloid-β (aβ) generation and thus represents a prime therapeutic target in treating alzheimer's disease (ad). notably, increasing evidence indicates that bace1 levels become elevated in ad brains as disease progresses; however, it remains unclear how the bace1 upregulation may affect efficacies of therapeutic interventions including bace1-inhibiting approaches. here, we crossed heterozygous bace1 knockout mice with ad transgenic mice (5xfad model) and compared the abilities of partial bace1 reduction to rescue ad-like phenotypes at earlier (6-month-old) and advanced (15–18-month-old) stages of disease, which expressed normal (∼100%) and elevated (∼200%) levels of bace1, respectively. bace1+/− deletion rescued memory deficits as tested by the spontaneous alternation y-maze task in 5xfad mice at the earlier stage and prevented their septohippocampal cholinergic deficits associated with significant neuronal loss. importantly, bace1+/− deletion was no longer able to rescue memory deficits or cholinergic neurodegeneration in 5xfad mice at the advanced stage. moreover, bace1+/− deletion significantly reduced levels of aβ42 and the β-secretase-cleaved c-terminal fragment (c99) in 6-month-old 5xfad mouse brains, while these neurotoxic β-cleavage products dramatically elevated with age and were not affected by bace1+/− deletion in 15–18-month-old 5xfad brains. interestingly, although bace1+/− deletion lowered bace1 expression by ∼50% in 5xfad mice irrespective of age in concordance with the reduction in gene copy number, bace1 equivalent to wild-type controls remained in bace1+/−·5xfad mice at the advanced age. in accord, phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eif2α, an important mediator of bace1 elevation, was dramatically increased (∼9-fold) in 15–18-month-old 5xfad mice and remained highly upregulated (∼6-fold) in age-matched bace1+/−·5xfad mice. together, our results indicate that partial reduction of bace1 is not sufficient to block the phospho-eif2α-dependent bace1 elevation during the progression of ad, thus limiting its abilities to reduce cerebral aβ/c99 levels and rescue memory deficits and cholinergic neurodegeneration.
acute remapping within the motor system induced by low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation we studied the effects of low-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms) on motor cortex excitability in humans. tms at 0.1 hz for 1 hour did not change cortical excitability. stimulation at 0.9 hz for 15 minutes (810 pulses), similar to the parameters used to induce long-term depression (ltd) in cortical slice preparations and in vivo animal studies, led to a mean decrease in motor evoked potential (mep) amplitude of 19.5%. the decrease in cortical excitability lasted for at least 15 minutes after the end of the 0.9 hz stimulation. the mechanism underlying this decrease in excitability may be similar to ltd. tms-induced reduction of cortical excitability has potential clinical applications in diseases such as epilepsy and myoclonus. spread of excitation, which may be a warning sign for seizures, occurred in one subject and was not accompanied by increased mep amplitude, suggesting that spread of excitation and amplitude changes are different phenomena and also indicating the need for adequate monitoring even with stimulations at low frequencies.
serotonergic nerve fibers in l-dopa-derived dopamine release and dyskinesia the development of l-dopa-induced dyskinesia (lid) remains a major problem in the long-term treatment of parkinson's disease (pd). this study aimed to assess the effect of the multitargeting molecule bn82451 on lid and to measure striatal mrna expression of several genes in a rat model of pd. rats were administered two unilateral injections of 6-ohda in the striatum. after four weeks, the animals started a chronic daily treatment with increasing doses of l-dopa over a further four-week period. over the course of l-dopa treatment, the rats developed abnormal involuntary movements (aims) classified as locomotive, axial, orolingual and forelimb dyskinesia. in animals rendered dyskinetic by l-dopa, administration of bn82451 at doses ranging from 1 to 10 mg/kg p.o. attenuated the severity of fully-established aims in a dose-related manner. this anti-dyskinetic effect could be achieved with lower doses of bn82451 administered sub chronically vs. acute single treatment. the improvement of aims is not due to a reduction in the general motor activity of dyskinetic rats. bn82451 treatment significantly reversed the overexpression of c-fos, fosb and arc mrna associated with the dyskinesiogenic action of l-dopa. a significant correlation between the degree of overexpression of c-fos, fosb and arc mrna and the dyskinesiogenic action of l-dopa was observed. the data demonstrate that bn82451 effectively attenuates lid and the associated molecular alterations in an animal model of pd and may represent a treatment option for managing dyskinesia.
number of days required to estimate habitual activity using wrist-worn geneactiv accelerometer: a cross-sectional study purpose to examine sources of variance in objective measures of physical activity in a group of healthy adults (n = 92) participating in a physical activity measurement study.   methods physical activity was assessed for up to 21 consecutive days using the computer science applications (csa) accelerometer. day-of-the-week effects were evaluated for activity counts (ct.min(-1).d(-1), ct.d(-1)) and time (min.d(-1)) spent in inactivity (0-499 ct), moderate-1 (500-1951 ct), and moderate-2-vigorous activity (> or =1952 ct). random effects models were employed to estimate variance components for subject, day of the week, and residual error from which the number of days of assessment required to achieve 80% reliability were estimated.   results physical inactivity was lower on weekend days, and saturday was the least inactive day of the week for both men and women. inter-individual variation, or differences between subjects, was proportionally the largest source of variance (55-60% of total) in accelerometer counts and time spent in moderate to vigorous activity. differences within subjects (intra-individual variation) accounted for 30-45% of the overall variance, and day-of-the-week effects accounted for 1-8%. for activity counts, and time spent in moderate to vigorous activity, at least 3-4 d of monitoring were required to achieve 80% reliability. reliable measures of physical inactivity required at least 7 d of monitoring.   conclusion these findings provide insight for understanding the behavioral variability in the activity patterns of adults and suggest that reliable measures of activity behaviors require at least 7 d of monitoring.
assessing biodiversity integrity for the conservation of grazed and burnt grassland systems: avian field metabolic rates as a rapid assessment tool in this study, we investigated the responses of two faunal groups, birds and arthropods, to varying degrees of disturbance caused by fire and grazing in south africa, eight study sites of varying fire frequency and stocking density were studied over two summer seasons (october–march). bird assemblages reflected habitat disturbance in a diversity of ways, driven by factors ranging from direct disturbance to changes in habitat structure and functioning, and shifts in food availability. similarly, arthropod diversity and abundance changed seasonally in response to management practices. fire frequency drives faunal assemblage structure and abundance and, in most cases, overrides the effects of grazing at all taxonomic levels. in particular, fire frequency strongly influenced grassland-breeding birds because farms are burnt in the territory-forming stage of the breeding cycle. insectivores and nectarivores were disproportionately impacted by intensive commercial management. of particular concern in this system is the yellow-breasted pipit (anthus chloris), which is regionally and globally vulnerable because of habitat loss. this species is sensitive to any form of habitat disturbance, highlighting the need for conservation attention in these grasslands. of the ten arthropod orders present in the study area, only orthoptera responded positively to burning. however, orthopterans made up on average 78% of arthropod biomass in moist highland grasslands, resulting in high grasshopper biomass on annually burnt farms: this high biomass in turn supports an abundance of insectivores. this reinforces the importance of process-oriented data where a measure of performance, such as reproductive success, is considered in assessing ecosystem condition.
analytical study on improving lookup performance of distributed hash table systems under churn we describe a peer-to-peer distributed hash table with provable consistency and performance in a fault-prone environment. our system routes queries and locates nodes using a novel xor-based metric topology that simplifies the algorithm and facilitates our proof. the topology has the property that every message exchanged conveys or reinforces useful contact information. the system exploits this information to send parallel, asynchronous query messages that tolerate node failures without imposing timeout delays on users.
coordination of cellular dynamics contributes to tooth epithelium deformations cofilin/adf proteins are a ubiquitously expressed family of f-actin depolymerizing factors found in eukaryotic cells including plants. in vitro, cofilin/adf activity has been shown to be essential for actin driven motility, by accelerating actin filament turnover. three actin depolymerizing factors (n-cofilin, m-cofilin, adf) can be found in mouse and human. here we show that in mouse the non-muscle-specific gene-n-cofilin-is essential for migration of neural crest cells as well as other cell types in the paraxial mesoderm. the main defects observed in n-cofilin mutant embryos are an impaired delamination and migration of neural crest cells, affecting the development of neural crest derived tissues. neural crest cells lacking n-cofilin do not polarize, and f-actin bundles or fibers are not detectable. in addition, n-cofilin is required for neuronal precursor cell proliferation and scattering. these defects result in a complete lack of neural tube closure in n-cofilin mutant embryos. although adf is overexpressed in mutant embryos, this cannot compensate the lack of n-cofilin, suggesting that they might have a different function in embryonic development. our data suggest that in mammalian development, regulation of the actin cytoskeleton by the f-actin depolymerizing factor n-cofilin is critical for epithelial-mesenchymal type of cell shape changes as well as cell proliferation.
gata3 haploinsufficiency causes a rapid deterioration of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (dpoaes) in mice a combined regimen of kanamycin sulfate treatment (175 mg/kg/day) and behavioral evaluation of resulting audiometric threshold shifts was used to produce selective outer hair cells (ohc) loss in chinchillas. this protocol resulted in a 3-7 mm region in the cochlear base in which ohcs were completely absent and inner hair cells (ihcs) were largely resent and normal at both light and electron microscopic levels. partial ohc loss was associated with audiometric threshold shifts in excess of 15 db, while complete ohc loss was associated with audiometric threshold shifts in excess of 40 db. after recovery periods of at least three weeks, phase-locking was examined across frequency for auditory nerve (viiith nerve) and ventral cochlear nucleus (vcn) neurons. the frequency range for neural phase-locking in normal subjects extended up to approximately 4 khz for viiith nerve fibers and 3 khz for vcn neurons. following kanamycin intoxication, however, the frequency range for neural phase-locking in both of these auditory regions varied with characteristic frequency (cf): neurons whose cf corresponded to normal cochlear regions exhibited phase-locking throughout the normal frequency range; neurons whole cf corresponded to cochlear regions with selective ohc loss exhibited a marked reduction in the frequency range over which they could phase-lock.
relationships between linear speed and lower-body power with change-of-direction speed in national collegiate athletic association divisions i and ii women soccer athletes magal, m, smith, rt, dyer, jj, and hoffman, jr. seasonal variation in physical performance-related variables in male ncaa division iii soccer players. j strength cond res 23(9): 2555-2559, 2009-the purpose of this study was to examine changes in various aerobic and anaerobic physical performance measures in male national collegiate athletic association (ncaa) division iii soccer players during the competitive soccer season. twelve starters of the men's soccer team (mean ± sd; age = 20.0 ± 0.9 years, height = 175.7 ± 8.1 cm, body mass = 73.9 ± 11.00 kg, body mass index [bmi] 24.0 ± 3.0 kg·m2, and percent body fat = 10.6 ± 5.4%) were tested at the beginning (prs) and the end (pos) of the collegiate soccer season. each experimental trial included a maximal aerobic capacity test (&ov0312;o2max); 10-, 30-, and 40-m sprints; pro-agility test; and the wingate anaerobic power test (want). from prs to pos, &ov0312;o2max significantly increased (51.05 ± 5.97 vs. 54.64 ± 4.90 ml·kg−1·min−1), and the 10- and 30-m sprint were significantly lower (2.03 ± 0.15 vs. 1.96 ± 0.11 seconds and 4.72 ± 0.26 vs. 4.51 ± 0.24 seconds, respectively). anthropometric measures, 40-m sprint, pro-agility test, and want were not significantly different between prs and pos. the results of this study indicate that ncaa division iii male soccer players appear to improve aerobic and anaerobic performance measures during the competitive soccer season. it is arguable that these performance improvements may represent a poor preseason conditioning level that may result in a competitive disadvantage during the early stages of the season. an ongoing process of recruiting better-quality players that may closely follow the off-season training regimen may partially remedy this problem.
information caching strategy for cyber social computing based wireless networks understanding how users behave when they connect to social networking sites creates opportunities for better interface design, richer studies of social interactions, and improved design of content distribution systems. in this paper, we present a first of a kind analysis of user workloads in online social networks. our study is based on detailed clickstream data, collected over a 12-day period, summarizing http sessions of 37,024 users who accessed four popular social networks: orkut, myspace, hi5, and linkedin. the data were collected from a social network aggregator website in brazil, which enables users to connect to multiple social networks with a single authentication. our analysis of the clickstream data reveals key features of the social network workloads, such as how frequently people connect to social networks and for how long, as well as the types and sequences of activities that users conduct on these sites. additionally, we crawled the social network topology of orkut, so that we could analyze user interaction data in light of the social graph. our data analysis suggests insights into how users interact with friends in orkut, such as how frequently users visit their friends' or non-immediate friends' pages. in summary, our analysis demonstrates the power of using clickstream data in identifying patterns in social network workloads and social interactions. our analysis shows that browsing, which cannot be inferred from crawling publicly available data, accounts for 92% of all user activities. consequently, compared to using only crawled data, considering silent interactions like browsing friends' pages increases the measured level of interaction among users.
comparison of susceptibility to opsonic killing by in vitro human immune response of enterococcus strains isolated from dairy products, clinical samples and probiotic preparation. in recent years there has been a significant upsurge in research on the characterisation and verification of the potential health benefits associated with the use of probiotics. in addition, the market for probiotics continues to expand exponentially as consumers (mostly healthy individuals) rely on health claims made by manufacturers to make their choices. this review appraises the available evidence for and against the health claims associated with probiotics. the use of probiotics in promoting gastrointestinal health and immunity, and their use in the prevention of urogenital infections, allergies and cancer are reviewed. furthermore, issues surrounding the use of probiotics in healthy individuals, the safety of probiotics and regulatory concerns are addressed. there is scientific evidence that specific strains of probiotic microorganisms confer health benefits on the host and are safe for human use. however, this evidence cannot be extrapolated to other strains, as these effects are strain-specific. probiotics have potential health benefits for conditions such as gastrointestinal infections, genitourinary infections, allergies and certain bowel disorders, all of which afflict a considerable proportion of the global population. however, considerable work is still needed to confirm these potential health benefits.
retracted: fmn2 makes perinuclear actin to protect nuclei during conﬁned migration and promote metastasis the actin cytoskeleton is essential for diverse processes in mammalian cells; these processes range from establishing cell polarity to powering cell migration to driving cytokinesis to positioning intracellular organelles. how these many functions are carried out in a spatiotemporally regulated manner in a single cytoplasm has been the subject of much study in the cytoskeleton field. recent work has identified a host of actin nucleation factors that can build architecturally diverse actin structures. the biochemical properties of these factors, coupled with their cellular location, likely define the functional properties of actin structures. in this article, we describe how recent advances in cell biology and biochemistry have begun to elucidate the role of individual actin nucleation factors in generating distinct cellular structures. we also consider how the localization and orientation of actin nucleation factors, in addition to their kinetic properties, are critical to their ability to build a functional actin cytoskeleton.
moderate intensity exercise training reverses functional aerobic impairment in hiv-infected individuals we attempted to measure cardiopulmonary effects, cd4 counts, and perceived sense of well-being in 25 individuals moderately to severely immunocompromised from hiv infection (mean entry cd4 count = 144.microliters-1) before and after a 24-wk program of exercise training. only six subjects completed the 24-wk program. all six showed evidence of a training effect. statistically significant improvements were seen in maximal oxygen consumption (vo2max), oxygen pulse, and minute ventilation. submaximal exercise performance improved significantly by 12 wk in the 10 individuals available for testing: decreases were seen in heart rate, rate pressure product, and rate of perceived exertion. white blood cell counts and t-lymphocyte subsets were stable at 12 and 24 wk in the subjects available for testing. high depression/anxiety scores on a mental health inventory (general health questionnaire) correlated with low cd4 counts. scores did not correlate with compliance with the exercise program. there was a trend (p < 0.10) for scores to improve over time among those individuals who attended > or = 80% of scheduled exercise sessions. we conclude that exercise training is feasible and beneficial for some hiv-infected individuals.
sequence determinants of compaction in intrinsically disordered proteins. protein folding and unfolding are coupled to a range of biological phenomena, from the regulation of cellular activity to the onset of neurodegenerative diseases. defining the nature of the conformations sampled in nonnative proteins is crucial for understanding the origins of such phenomena. we have used a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy and site-directed mutagenesis to study unfolded states of the protein lysozyme. extensive clusters of hydrophobic structure exist within the wild-type protein even under strongly denaturing conditions. these clusters involve distinct regions of the sequence but are all disrupted by a single point mutation that replaced residue trp62 with gly located at the interface of the two major structural domains in the native state. thus, nativelike structure in the denatured protein is stabilized by the involvement of trp62 in nonnative and long-range interactions.
genetic screen of african americans with fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy objective to review 30 years' clinical experience with fuchs corneal endothelial dystrophy leading to penetrating keratoplasty (pk).   methods we reviewed the clinical records of patients diagnosed histopathologically as having fuchs corneal endothelial dystrophy who underwent pk at duke university medical center between january 1, 1972, and december 31, 2001. this observational case series included 424 patients (546 eyes).   results women represented 77.6% of patients. mean age at the time of pk for all patients was 69.2 years. bilateral pk was required in 28.8% of patients, and the mean interval between the 2 pks was 3.2 years. there was no difference with regard to sex in the likelihood of requiring bilateral pk (p=.59). among 376 documented family histories, 13.6% were known to be positive for fuchs dystrophy. patients with a positive family history underwent pk a mean of 5 years earlier (p<.002) and were more likely to require bilateral pk (p<.003). patients who underwent bilateral pk were twice as likely to have a positive family history compared with those undergoing unilateral pk (p<.001). mean visual acuities at corneal thicknesses of 539 to 650 microm, 651 to 750 microm, and greater than 750 microm were 20/60, 20/60, and 20/80, respectively. patients who underwent bilateral pk and had a preceding cataract extraction on 1 eye required pk of the pseudophakic eye on average 3.2 years earlier than the fellow eye. the mean time from cataract extraction to pk was 2.2 years.   conclusions this large study affirms that fuchs dystrophy is a disorder of aging that predominantly affects women (3.5:1) and is often familial. pachymetry-determined corneal thickness was a poor predictor of visual acuity until extreme levels of corneal edema were reached. cataract extraction in an eye with fuchs dystrophy leads to earlier pk.
improving availability applying intelligent replication in federated cloud storage based on log analysis with the increasing utilization and popularity of the cloud infrastructure, more and more data are moved to the cloud storage systems. this makes the availability of cloud storage services critically important, particularly given the fact that outages of cloud storage services have indeed happened from time to time. thus, solely depending on a single cloud storage provider for storage services can risk violating the service-level agreement (sla) due to the weakening of service availability. this has led to the notion of cloud-of-clouds, where data redundancy is introduced to distribute data among multiple independent cloud storage providers, to address the problem. the key in the effectiveness of the cloud-of-clouds approaches lies in how the data redundancy is incorporated and distributed among the clouds. however, the existing cloud-of-clouds approaches utilize either replication or erasure codes to redundantly distribute data across multiple clouds, thus incurring either high space or high performance overheads. in this paper, we propose a hybrid redundant data distribution approach, called hyrd, to improve the cloud storage availability in cloud-of-clouds by exploiting the workload characteristics and the diversity of cloud providers. in hyrd, large files are distributed in multiple cost-efficient cloud storage providers with erasure-coded data redundancy while small files and file system metadata are replicated on multiple high-performance cloud storage providers. the experiments conducted on our lightweight prototype implementation of hyrd show that hyrd improves the cost efficiency by 33.4% and 20.4%, and reduces the access latency by 58.7% and 34.8% than the duracloud and racs schemes, respectively.
role of the glycanases exok and exsh in regulating the molecular weight of the rhizobium meliloti exopolysaccharide succinoglycan summarysymbiotic mutants of rhizobium meliloti were isolated following tn5 mutagenesis. besides four nodulation mutants (nod-) unable to induce nodule formation on alfalfa, five infection mutants (inf-), which induce the formation of root nodules without detectable infection threads or bacteroids, were obtained. the inf- mutants were subdivided into two classes. one class contains mutants which fail to synthesize acidic exopolysaccharide (eps-). the other class is comprised of mutants which produce excess amounts of acidic exopolysaccharide (eps*). 13c nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the exopolysaccharide isolated from one of the latter type of inf- mutant, 101.45, revealed that the side chain of the repeating octosaccharide unit lacks the terminal pyruvate residue. complementing cosmids were isolated for all inf- mutants. in the case of the inf- eps- mutants the complementing cosmids contain dna segments which overlap and are part of megaplasmid 2. for two mutants the mutations were found to map on a 7.8 kb ecori fragment. in the case of the inf- eps* mutants the complementing cosmids carry chromosomal dna. the mutations of two inf- eps* mutants were localized on a 6.4 kb ecori fragment. coinoculation of alfalfa plants with nod- and inf- eps- mutants resulted in effective symbiosis. the nodules appeared wild type and fixed nitrogen. in constrast, coinoculations with nod- mutants and the inf- eps* mutant 101.45 did not result in the formation of effective nodules.
maternal treatment with dexamethasone during gestation alters sexual development markers in the f1 and f2 male offspring of wistar rats. unlabelled we studied the effects of chronic renal failure on the pituitary-cortisol axis and adrenal androgen function in 26 patients (16 male and 10 female), aged 6.5 to 22.5 years (mean 14.5). ten patients were prepubertal, 8 pubertal, and 8 post-pubertal. all of them were on chronic hemodialysis. pubic hair development was delayed in 56% of the patients. serum cortisol was increased in 15 out of the 26 patients. serum delta 4-androstenedione was high in 11 out of 15 patients in tanner's stage i or ii and in 1 out of 11 patients in tanner's stage iii, iv or v (p less than 0.01). serum cortisol was elevated in 10 out of 12 patients with high serum delta 4-androstenedione and in only 5 out of 14 with normal delta 4-androstenedione (p less than 0.02). serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate was normal in 22 patients and elevated in 4 males. there was a significant inverse correlation between bone age and serum cortisol (r: -0.59; p less than 0.005) and a significant positive correlation between bone age and serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (r: 0.45 p less than 0.01). serum acth was normal. a reduction by 50% in cortisol and 78% in dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate was found after dexamethasone suppression, but delta 4-androstenedione did not suppress after dexamethasone. after acth stimulation test cortisol increased by 50% and delta 4-androstenedione by 80%.   conclusions the increased levels of cortisol and delta 4-androstenedione with partial resistance to dexamethasone suggest that these patients have a hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction similar to that found in cushing's disease or in chronic stress. the difference in the responses of delta 4-androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate observed is consistent with the existence of different mechanisms of control for these two steroids.
who does not participate in telehealth trials and why? a cross-sectional survey backgroundhome telehealth has the potential to benefit heart failure (hf) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) patients, however large-scale deployment is yet to be achieved.purposethe aim of this review was to assess levels of uptake of home telehealth by patients with hf and copd and the factors that determine whether patients do or do not accept and continue to use telehealth.methodsthis research performs a narrative synthesis of the results from included studies.resultsthirty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria. studies that reported rates of refusal and/or withdrawal found that almost one third of patients who were offered telehealth refused and one fifth of participants who did accept later abandoned telehealth. seven barriers to, and nine facilitators of, home telehealth use were identified.conclusionsresearch reports need to provide more details regarding telehealth refusal and abandonment, in order to understand the reasons why patients decide not to use telehealth.
specialization of binaural responses in ventral auditory cortices the acoustical cues for sound location are generated by spatial- and frequency-dependent filtering of propagating sound waves by the head and external ears. although rats have been a common model system for anatomy, physiology, and psychophysics of localization, there have been few studies of the acoustical cues available to rats. here, directional transfer functions (dtfs), the directional components of the head-related transfer functions, were measured in six adult rats. the cues to location were computed from the dtfs. in the frontal hemisphere, spectral notches were present for frequencies from approximately 16 to 30 khz; in general, the frequency corresponding to the notch increased with increases in source elevation and in azimuth toward the ipsilateral ear. the maximum high-frequency envelope-based interaural time differences (itds) were 130 mus, whereas low-frequency (<3.5 khz) fine-structure itds were 160 mus; both types of itds were larger than predicted from spherical head models. interaural level differences (ilds) strongly depended on location and frequency. maximum ilds were <10 db for frequencies <8 khz and were as large as 20-40 db for frequencies >20 khz. removal of the pinna eliminated the spectral notches, reduced the acoustic gain and ilds, altered the acoustical axis, and reduced the itds.
range-wide analysis of wildlife habitat: implications for conservation it is generally perceived that biodiversity is better protected from human activities after an area is designated as a protected area. however, we found that this common perception was not true in wolong nature reserve (southwestern china), which was established in 1975 as a “flagship” protected area for the world-renowned endangered giant pandas. analyses of remote sensing data from pre- and post-establishment periods indicate that the reserve has become more fragmented and less suitable for giant panda habitation. the rate of loss of high-quality habitat after the reserve's establishment was much higher than before the reserve was created, and the fragmentation of high-quality habitat became far more severe. after the creation of the reserve, rates of habitat loss and fragmentation inside the reserve unexpectedly increased to levels that were similar to or higher than those outside the reserve, in contrast to the situation before the reserve was created.
identification and characterization of a gene activated by the deformed homeoprotein. mutations in the fushi tarazu (ftz) locus of drosophila result in embryos with half the usual number of body segments. the sequences of the wild-type gene, a temperature-sensitive allele and a dominant mutant allele are presented. a portion of the conserved protein domain present in ftz and several homoeotic genes resembles the dna-binding region of prokaryotic dna-binding proteins, and is also similar to products of the yeast mating-type locus.
literature-based discovery of ifn-γ and vaccine-mediated gene interaction networks exponential growth of the peer-reviewed literature and the breakdown of disciplinary boundaries heralded by genome-scale instruments have made it harder than ever for scientists to find and assimilate all the publications relevant to their research. the widespread adoption of title/abstract word search, primarily through the national library of medicine's pubmed system (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed), was the first major change in the way bioscientists found relevant publications since the origin of index medicus in 1879.
the welfare implications of using exotic tortoises as ecological replacements summarywe investigated seasonal changes in diet and distribution of giant tortoises (geochelone gigantea (schweigger)) on aldabra atoll in the indian ocean. animals were counted and their activity and feeding behaviour recorded on transects where vegetation composition and primary production had been studied (gibson and phillipson in press a, b).there were striking seasonal shifts in tortoise distribution, and male, female, and juvenile tortoises were found in different proportions in different vegetation types.tortoises are selective grazers, feeding on a wide range of foodstuffs of which the most important (61% of feeding observations) was tortoise turf. diet varied seasonally, with shrub leaves (mostly litter) overtaking tortoise turf in importance in the late dry season; diet broadened as the dry season progressed. male and female diets were not significantly different but juveniles fed on herbs and mosaic rock vegetation more often than adults.seasonal shifts in distribution are due to movements in response to changes in food availability, measured by the foods' cover abundances and production phenologies. tortoises concentrate on preferred foods when available, but become less selective as production falls. some differences in size and sex class distribution between habitats can also be explained by food availability.in the late dry season density peaks on the coastal sporobolus virginicus (l.) kunth sward. a detailed study showed that, while at least 20% of the population uses the sward each year, visit times are short and turnover of tortoises high, as would be expected on a non-preferred food.the giant tortoise interacts with its food supply similarly to other large herbivores, except that the low maintenance needs of this large poikilotherm allow it to develop unusually high population densities.
rice osfls2-mediated perception of bacterial flagellins is evaded by xanthomonas oryzae pvs. oryzae and oryzicola. the bacterial flagellin (flic) epitopes flg22 and flgii-28 are microbe-associated molecular patterns (mamps). although flg22 is recognized by many plant species via the pattern recognition receptor fls2, neither the flgii-28 receptor nor the extent of flgii-28 recognition by different plant families is known. here, we tested the significance of flgii-28 as a mamp and the importance of allelic diversity in flg22 and flgii-28 in plant-pathogen interactions using purified peptides and a pseudomonas syringae ∆flic mutant complemented with different flic alleles. the plant genotype and allelic diversity in flg22 and flgii-28 were found to significantly affect the plant immune response, but not bacterial motility. the recognition of flgii-28 is restricted to a number of solanaceous species. although the flgii-28 peptide does not trigger any immune response in arabidopsis, mutations in both flg22 and flgii-28 have fls2-dependent effects on virulence. however, the expression of a tomato allele of fls2 does not confer to nicotiana benthamiana the ability to detect flgii-28, and tomato plants silenced for fls2 are not altered in flgii-28 recognition. therefore, mamp diversification is an effective pathogen virulence strategy, and flgii-28 appears to be perceived by an as yet unidentified receptor in the solanaceae, although it has an fls2-dependent virulence effect in arabidopsis.
the secret life of the anthrax agent bacillus anthracis: bacteriophage-mediated ecological adaptations phage-mediated lysis has been an essential laboratory tool for rapidly identifying bacillus anthracis for more than 40 years, relying on the gamma phage derivative of a bacillus cereus prophage called w. the complete genomic sequences of the temperate w phage, referred to as wbeta, and its lytic variant gamma were determined and found to encode 53 open reading frames each, spanning 40,864 bp and 37,373 bp, respectively. direct comparison of the genomes showed that gamma evolved through mutations at key loci controlling host recognition, lysogenic growth, and possibly host phenotypic modification. included are a cluster of point mutations at the gp14 tail fiber locus of gamma, encoding a protein that, when fused to green fluorescent protein, binds specifically to b. anthracis. a large 2,003-bp deletion was also identified at the gamma lysogeny module, explaining its shift from a temperate to a lytic lifestyle. finally, evidence of recombination was observed at a dicistronic wbeta locus, encoding putative bacterial cell surface-modifying proteins, replaced in gamma with a locus, likely obtained from a b. anthracis prophage, encoding demonstrable fosfomycin resistance. reverse transcriptase pcr analysis confirmed strong induction at the dicistronic wbeta locus and at four other phage loci in b. anthracis and/or b. cereus lysogens. in all, this study represents the first genomic and functional description of two historically important phages and is part of a broader investigation into contributions of phage to the b. anthracis life cycle. initial findings suggest that lysogeny of b. anthracis promotes ecological adaptation, rather than virulence, as with other gram-positive pathogens.
towards a framework of digital platform competition: a comparative study of monopolistic & federated mobile payment platforms i this essay, we argue that pervasive digitization gives birth to a new type of product architecture: the layered modular architecture. the layered modular architecture extends the modular architecture of physical products by incorporating four loosely coupled layers of devices, networks, services, and contents created by digital technology. we posit that this new architecture instigates profound changes in the ways that firms organize for innovation in the future. we develop (1) a conceptual framework to describe the emerging organizing logic of digital innovation and (2) an information systems research agenda for digital strategy and the creation and management of corporate information technology infrastructures.
adipose-derived stem cells differentiate into a schwann cell phenotype and promote neurite outgrowth in vitro ©2005 british editorial society of bone and joint surgery doi:10.1302/0301-620x.87b10. 16700 $2.00 j bone joint surg [br] 2005;87-b:1309-19. peripheral nerve injuries, particularly in the upper limb, may have devastating consequences. the outcome of injury is determined by the amount of cellular damage, and by variables which include the site of the lesion, the degree of disruption of the connective-tissue sheaths that surround the nerve, the extent of associated injuries, particularly vascular injuries (fig. 1), and the age and health of the patient. meticulous surgical repair cannot guarantee full functional recovery because the surgeon does not control the ‘biological battlefield’ which rages inside a damaged nerve. 1 therapeutic manipulation of the response to injury at the molecular level has the potential to keep more neurones alive, encourage their axons to cross longer interstump gaps, to maximise the accuracy of target re-innervation and to manage neuropathic pain. for now, these objectives remain aspirational – they are predicated on a more detailed understanding of the way in which the peripheral nervous system responds to injury than is presently available. this brief update on the peripheral arm of the response to injury in the peripheral nervous system highlights areas where translational research may prove to be beneficial, for information on axotomy-related central phenomena, the reader is referred to earlier reviews. 2-4
climatic forcing on channel profiles in the eastern cordillera of the coroico region, bolivia the bolivian andes flank one of earth’s major topographic features and dominate sediment input into the amazon basin. millennial-scale erosion rates and dominant controls on erosion patterns in this range are poorly known. to define these patterns, we present 48 erosion rate estimates, derived from analysis of in situ 10 be in quartz-bearing alluvium collected from the upper beni river basin. erosion rates, corrected for the non-uniform distribution of quartz in the sample basins, range from 0·04 mm a −1 to 1·35 mm a −1 and thus integrate over 10 2 ‐10 4 years. mean and modal values are 0·42 (standard deviation: 0·29) and 0·2‐0·4 mm a −1 respectively, within the range of long-term average erosion rates in this area derived from apatite fission track thermochronology (0·1‐0·6 mm a −1 ). hence, our data do not record any significant variation in erosion rate over the last several million years. mean and modal short-term erosion rates for the andes are an order of magnitude lower than rates in the ganges river headwaters in the high himalaya and an order of magnitude greater than rates typical of the european alps. in the upper beni river region of the bolivian andes, short-term, basin-averaged erosion rates correlate with normalized channel steepness index, a metric of relative channel gradient corrected for drainage area. neither normalized channel steepness index nor basin-averaged erosion rate shows strong correlation with mean basin hillslope gradient or mean basin local relief because many hillslopes in the upper beni river region are at threshold values of slope and local relief. patterns of normalized channel steepness index appear primarily to reflect tectonic patterns and transient adjustment to those patterns by channel networks. climate and lithology do not appear to exert first-order controls on patterns of basin-averaged erosion rates in the bolivian andes. copyright © 2005 john wiley & sons, ltd.
bidirectional associations between parental warmth, callous unemotional behavior, and behavior problems in high-risk preschoolers seven hundred thirty-one income-eligible families in 3 geographical regions who were enrolled in a national food supplement program were screened and randomized to a brief family intervention. at child ages 2 and 3, the intervention group caregivers were offered the family check-up and linked parenting support services. latent growth models on caregiver reports at child ages 2, 3, and 4 revealed decreased behavior problems when compared with the control group. intervention effects occurred predominantly among families reporting high levels of problem behavior at child age 2. families in the intervention condition improved on direct observation measures of caregivers' positive behavior support at child ages 2 and 3; improvements in positive behavior support mediated improvements in children's early problem behavior.
school refusal assessment scale-revised: factorial invariance and latent means differences across gender and age in spanish children the positive and negative affect schedule for children (panas-c/p; child and parent versions) yield positive affect (pa) and negative affect (na) scales that are clinically useful for identifying youth with anxiety and mood problems. despite the advantages that item response theory (irt) offers relative to classical test theory with respect to shortening test instruments, no studies to date have applied irt methodology to the panas-c/p scales. in the present study, we thus applied irt methodology using a school-based development sample (child sample: n = 799; parent sample: n = 553) and developed a shortened 5-item pa scale (joyful, cheerful, happy, lively, proud) and a 5-item na scale (miserable, mad, afraid, scared, sad) for the sake of simultaneously increasing the assessment efficiency of the panas-c/p scales while improving the psychometric properties of the scales. the reduced pa and na child scales classified relevant diagnostic groups in a separate clinic-referred validation sample (n = 662) just as well as the original panas-c child scales and may be used to help identify youth with internalizing disorders in need of mental health services.
kernel conditional exponential family in this paper, we consider an infinite dimensional exponential family, $\mathcal{p}$ of probability densities, which are parametrized by functions in a reproducing kernel hilbert space, $h$ and show it to be quite rich in the sense that a broad class of densities on $\mathbb{r}^d$ can be approximated arbitrarily well in kullback-leibler (kl) divergence by elements in $\mathcal{p}$. the main goal of the paper is to estimate an unknown density, $p_0$ through an element in $\mathcal{p}$. standard techniques like maximum likelihood estimation (mle) or pseudo mle (based on the method of sieves), which are based on minimizing the kl divergence between $p_0$ and $\mathcal{p}$, do not yield practically useful estimators because of their inability to efficiently handle the log-partition function. instead, we propose an estimator, $\hat{p}_n$ based on minimizing the \emph{fisher divergence}, $j(p_0\vert p)$ between $p_0$ and $p\in \mathcal{p}$, which involves solving a simple finite-dimensional linear system. when $p_0\in\mathcal{p}$, we show that the proposed estimator is consistent, and provide a convergence rate of $n^{-\min\left\{\frac{2}{3},\frac{2\beta+1}{2\beta+2}\right\}}$ in fisher divergence under the smoothness assumption that $\log p_0\in\mathcal{r}(c^\beta)$ for some $\beta\ge 0$, where $c$ is a certain hilbert-schmidt operator on $h$ and $\mathcal{r}(c^\beta)$ denotes the image of $c^\beta$. we also investigate the misspecified case of $p_0\notin\mathcal{p}$ and show that $j(p_0\vert\hat{p}_n)\rightarrow \inf_{p\in\mathcal{p}}j(p_0\vert p)$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$, and provide a rate for this convergence under a similar smoothness condition as above. through numerical simulations we demonstrate that the proposed estimator outperforms the non-parametric kernel density estimator, and that the advantage with the proposed estimator grows as $d$ increases.
macular pigment density changes in japanese individuals supplemented with lutein or zeaxanthin: quantification via resonance raman spectrophotometry and autofluorescence imaging age-related macular degeneration (amd) is thought to be the result of a lifetime of oxidative insult that results in photoreceptor death within the macula. increased risk of amd may result from low levels of lutein and zeaxanthin (macular pigment) in the diet, serum or retina, and excessive exposure to blue light. through its light-screening capacity and antioxidant activity, macular pigment may reduce photooxidation in the central retina. lutein supplements, at 30 mg/d, were shown previously to increase serum lutein and macular pigment density in two subjects. in this study, we compared the effects of a range of lutein doses (2.4- 30 mg/d), as well as a high zeaxanthin dose (30 mg/d), on the serum and macular pigment in a series of experiments. serum carotenoids were quantified by hplc. macular pigment densities were determined psychophysically. serum lutein concentrations in each subject reached a plateau that was correlated with the dose (r = 0.82, p < 0.001). plateau concentrations ranged from 2.8 x 10(-7) to 2.7 x 10(-6) mol/l. zeaxanthin was less well absorbed than an equal lutein dose, resulting in plateaus of approximately 5 x 10(-7) mol/l. the rate of increase in macular pigment optical density was correlated with the plateau concentration of carotenoids in the serum (r = 0.58, p < 0.001), but not with the presupplementation optical density (r = 0.13, p = 0.21). the mean rate of increase was (3.42 +/- 0.80) x 10(5) mau/d per unit concentration (mol/l) of carotenoids in the serum. it remains to be demonstrated whether lutein or zeaxanthin dietary supplements reduce the incidence of amd.
significance of the 13c-caffeine breath test for patients with cirrhosis the properties of caffeine render it an ideal substrate for a quantitative test of liver function. the aim of this study was to determine whether the caffeine breath test (cbt) using orally administered 13c‐caffeine correlates reliably with plasma caffeine clearance and reflects varying degrees of liver dysfunction. the cbt was performed in 25 healthy controls; 20 subjects with noncirrhotic, chronic hepatitis b or c; and 20 subjects with cirrhosis. plasma caffeine clearance was assayed simultaneously with the cbt in a cohort of these subjects. over a broad range of caffeine clearances, the cbt exhibited a highly significant correlation with plasma clearance (r = 0.85, p < .001). cirrhotic patients were characterized by significantly reduced cbt values (1.15 ± 0.75 δ‰ mg−1) compared with controls (2.23 ± 0.76; p = .001) and hepatitic patients (1.83 ± 1.05; p = .04). there was a significant inverse relationship between the cbt and child‐pugh score (r = −.74, p = .002). the intraclass correlation coefficient between repeated cbts in 20 subjects with normal and cirrhotic livers was 0.89. although smoking was associated with an 86% to 141% increase in cbt in all groups, the cbt was able to distinguish control, hepatitic, and cirrhotic smokers (5.36 ± 0.82, 3.63 ± 1.21, and 2.14 ± 1.14, respectively, p = .001). multivariate analysis revealed that only smoking (p < .001) and disease state (p = .001) were significant predictors of the cbt. in conclusion, the 13c‐cbt represents a valid indicator of plasma caffeine clearance and correlates reproducibly with hepatic dysfunction.
adrenocortical responsiveness in southern elephant seal mothers and pups during lactation and the effect of scientific handling in the rat, lactation suppresses a variety of physiological responses to stress. we investigated whether stress-responsive neurohormonal systems are also restrained during breast feeding in humans. we chose treadmill exercise as a stressor because this stimulus produces an exercise intensity-dependent activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathomedullary system that is independent of differences in physical conditioning among subjects. ten lactating and ten nonlactating women who were between 7 and 18 weeks postpartum performed 20 min of graded treadmill exercise. the final 5 min of exercise was set to elicit 90% of the maximal oxygen uptake of each subject. plasma acth, cortisol, and glucose responses to exercise were significantly attenuated in lactating women (p < 0.001, p < 0.05, and p < 0.001, respectively). basal norepinephrine levels were also reduced in lactating women (p < 0.05). these results indicate that stress-responsive neurohormonal systems are restrained in lactating women.
environment-sensitive quinolone demonstrating long-lived fluorescence and unusually slow excited-state intramolecular proton transfer kinetics. by using four labels of the 3-hydroxyflavone family displaying selective sensitivity to hydrogen bond (hb) donors and poor response to other polar molecules, we developed an approach for measuring local water concentration [h(2)o](l) (or partial volume of water: w(a) = [h(2)o](l)/55.6) in the label surrounding both in solvent mixtures and in biomolecules by the intensity ratio of two emissive forms of the label, n*/t*. using a series of binary water/solvent mixtures with limited preferential solvation effects, a linear dependence of log(n*/t*) on the local concentration of hb donor was obtained and then used as a calibration curve for estimating the w(a) values in the surroundings of the probes conjugated to biomolecules. by this approach, we estimated the hydration of the labels in different peptides and their complexes with dnas. we found that w(a) values for the label at the peptide n-terminus are lower (0.63-0.91) than for free labels and depend strongly on the nature of the n-terminal amino acid. when complexed with different dnas, the estimated hydration of the labels conjugated to the labeled peptides was much lower (w(a) = 0-0.47) and depended on the dna nature and linker-label structure. thus, the elaborated method allows a site-specific evaluation of hydration at the surface of a biomolecule through the determination of the partial volume of water. we believe the developed procedure can be successfully applied for monitoring hydration at the surface of any biomolecule or nanostructure.
a comparative proteomics analysis of soybean leaves under biotic and abiotic treatments the glycine-serine interconversion, catalysed by glycine decarboxylase and serine hydroxymethyltransferase, is an important reaction of primary metabolism in all organisms including plants, by providing one-carbon units for many biosynthetic reactions. in plants, in addition, it is an integral part of the photorespiratory metabolic pathway and produces large amounts of photorespiratory co(2) within mitochondria. although controversial, there is significant evidence that this process, by the relocation of glycine decarboxylase within the leaves from the mesophyll to the bundle-sheath, contributed to the evolution of c(4) photosynthesis. in this review, some aspects of current knowledge about glycine decarboxylase and serine hydroxymethyltransferase and the role of these enzymes in metabolism, about the corresponding genes and their expression as well as about mutants and anti-sense plants related to these genes or processes will be summarized and discussed. from a comparison of the available information about the number and organization of gdc and shmt genes in the genomes of arabidopsis thaliana and oryza sativa it appears that these and, possibly, other genes related to photorespiration, are similarly organized even in only very distantly related angiosperms.
lgr5+ amacrine cells possess regenerative potential in the retina of adult mice it was previously reported that the ciliary epithelium (ce) of the mammalian eye contains a rare population of cells that could produce clonogenic self-renewing pigmented spheres in culture. based on their ability to up-regulate genes found in retinal neurons, it was concluded that these sphere-forming cells were retinal stem cells. this conclusion raised the possibility that ce-derived retinal stem cells could help to restore vision in the millions of people worldwide who suffer from blindness associated with retinal degeneration. we report here that human and mouse ce-derived spheres are made up of proliferating pigmented ciliary epithelial cells rather than retinal stem cells. all of the cells in the ce-derived spheres, including the proliferating cells, had molecular, cellular, and morphological features of differentiated pigmented ce cells. these differentiated cells ectopically expressed nestin when exposed to growth factors and low levels of pan-neuronal markers such as beta-iii-tubulin. although the cells aberrantly expressed neuronal markers, they retained their pigmented ce cell morphology and failed to differentiate into retinal neurons in vitro or in vivo. our results provide an example of a differentiated cell type that can form clonogenic spheres in culture, self-renew, express progenitor cell markers, and initiate neuronal differentiation that is not a stem or progenitor cell. more importantly, our findings highlight the importance of shifting the focus away from studies on ce-derived spheres for cell-based therapies to restore vision in the degenerating retina and improving techniques for using es cells or retinal precursor cells.
age-related changes in two- and three-dimensional morphology of type-identified endplates in the rat diaphragm the effects of aging on motor units of different types and the spatial arrangement of motor units are discussed. this article is, however, not a comprehensive survey of the literature, but rather a summary of our own results with the addition of relevant reports. the glycogen depletion technique was used to identify the muscle fibers in a motor unit (motor unit fibers). the motor unit fibers were subsequently characterized according to immunocytochemical, enzyme-histochemical and morphometrical properties, and the spatial arrangement was determined with the aid of a computer-assisted model. an age-related motor unit transformation was observed in both fast- and slow-twitch rat skeletal muscles as was a rearrangement of motor unit fibers. the spatial redistribution of motor unit fibers, higher innervation ratios, and larger motor unit territories in old age indicate an age-related denervation-reinnervation process due to loss of alpha-motoneurones.
mrc1 marks early-firing origins and coordinates timing and efficiency of initiation in fission yeast † the swi1‐swi3 replication fork protection complex and mrc1 protein are required for stabilization of stalled replication forks in fission yeast. hsk1 kinase also plays roles in checkpoint responses elicited by arrested replication forks. we show that both swi1 and swi3, the abundance of which are interdependent, are required for chromatin association of mrc1. co‐immunoprecipitation experiments show the interactions of swi1‐swi3, mrc1 and hsk1. mrc1 interacts with swi3 and hsk1 proteins through its central segment (378–879) containing a sq/tq cluster, and this segment is sufficient for checkpoint reaction. the sq/tq cluster segment (536–673) is essential but not sufficient for the interactions and for resistance to replication inhibitor hydroxyurea. mrc1 protein level is increased in hsk1–89 cells due to apparent stabilization, and we have identified a potential phosphodegron sequence. these results suggest that interactions of the swi1‐swi3 complex and hsk1 kinase with mrc1 may play a role in cellular responses to stalled replication forks in fission yeast.
successful treatment of children in clinical practice relies on the ability of the dental practitioner to guide them through their dental experiences autonomic and behavioral responses to seven dental procedures were studied in 21 pedodontic patients aged six to 12. when mean pulse rate, pulse amplitude, absolute skin conductance, and skin-conductance responses were compared over all subjects, the injection of the local anesthetic consistently elicited the greatest response. in five patients where anesthesia was inadequate, painful high-speed drilling also elicited large responses. when autonomic responses were compared between high-anxious and low-anxious children, both groups showed similar transient responsiveness. high-anxious children showed a significantly higher basal level of sympathetic activity.
effects of food availability on dispersal and cub sex ratio in the mednyi arctic fox summarythis paper presents analyses of habitat-use and home range size in the blanford's fox. we predicted, from the resource dispersion hypothesis (rdh), that home ranges would encompass similar areas of combined fruitful habitats, but widely different areas of useless habitats, and thus that home ranges would be larger where such fruitful patches are fragmented and widely dispersed. home range estimates of 0.5–2.0 km2 were calculated for 16 adult blanford's foxes, using three different methods. there were no significant differences in home range size between sexes or study sites. one habitat, dry creekbed, was the most frequently visited in all home ranges. dry creekbed provided abundant prey for the foxes and only sparse cover for their predators. both the available area of creekbed in each range, and the area of creekbed patches that was used by the foxes, were independent of home range size. however, the variance in home range size was explained by the mean distance between the main denning area and the most frequently used patches of creekbed. these results are in accord with some predictions of the resource dispersion hypothesis.
role of the indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase/kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism in behavioral alterations in a hepatic encephalopathy rat model backgroundhepatic encephalopathy (he) is a reversible neuropsychiatric syndrome associated with acute and chronic liver diseases. it includes a number of neuropsychiatric disturbances including impaired motor activity and coordination, intellectual and cognitive function.resultsin the present study, we used a chronic rat he model by ligation of the bile duct (bdl) for 4 weeks. these rats showed increased plasma ammonia level, bile duct hyperplasia and impaired spatial learning memory and motor coordination when tested with rota-rod and morris water maze tests, respectively. by immunohistochemistry, the cerebral cortex showed swelling of astrocytes and microglia activation. to gain a better understanding of the effect of he on the brain, the dendritic arbors of layer v cortical pyramidal neurons and hippocampal ca1 pyramidal neurons were revealed by an intracellular dye injection combined with a 3-dimensional reconstruction. although the dendritic arbors remained unaltered, the dendritic spine density on these neurons was significantly reduced. it was suggested that the reduction of dendritic spines may be the underlying cause for increased motor evoked potential threshold and prolonged central motor conduction time in clinical finding in cirrhosis.conclusionswe found that he perturbs cns functions by altering the dendritic morphology of cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons, which may be the underlying cause for the motor and intellectual impairments associated with he patients.
neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus are selective for diverse and complex visual features here we ask whether visual response pattern varies with position in the cortical microcircuit by comparing the structure of receptive fields recorded from the different layers of the cat's primary visual cortex. we used whole-cell recording in vivo to show the spatial distribution of visually evoked excitatory and inhibitory inputs and to stain individual neurons. we quantified the distribution of 'on' and 'off' responses and the presence of spatially opponent excitation and inhibition within the receptive field. the thalamorecipient layers (4 and upper 6) were dominated by simple cells, as defined by two criteria: they had separated on and off subregions, and they had push-pull responses (in a given subregion, stimuli of the opposite contrast evoked responses of the opposite sign). other types of response profile correlated with laminar location as well. thus, connections unique to each visual cortical layer are likely to serve distinct functions.
do age and anticoagulants affect the natural history of acute subdural hematomas? an 11-month-old female baby was found dead by her mother. cranial postmortem ct prior to the forensic autopsy showed dilatation of bilateral extra-axial spaces and ventricles. the autopsy revealed a new linear fracture of the left parietal bone and occipital bone, and a healed linear fracture of the right parietal bone and occipital bone like a mirror image of the left one as well. intracranially, 230ml of subdural fluid were collected, which was mixed with blood. there was a fresh hemorrhage around a bridging vein of the left parietal lobe and the dura mater. moreover, the outer side of the cerebrum and the inner side of the dura mater were covered by a thin membrane, which mater might have been previously formed because of being positive for fe-staining and anti-cd68 antibody. a subdural hematoma might have been developed when the right side of the skull was previously fractured, which was transformed into a subdural hygroma. subsequently, it is likely that, after the left side fracture of the skull occurred, the subdural hygroma rapidly enlarged due to hemorrhaging from the bridging vein, which resulted in intracranial hypertension, because microbleeding was detected in the brain stem. accordingly, we diagnosed the cause and manner of death as intracranial hypertension due to subdural hemorrhage in subdural hygroma, and homicide, including child abuse, respectively.
groups, graphs, languages, automata, games and second-order monadic logic abstract a class of edge-labeled graphs called context-free are defined according to their behavior at infinity. such graphs are generalizations of cayley graphs of context-free groups. they are also shown to be definable in a very natural way in terms of push-down automata. using rabin's theorem on the monadic second-order theory of the finite binary tree, these graphs are also shown to have a decidable monadic second-order theory. questions about tiling systems and cellular automata operating on these graphs are decidable even when the analogous questions are not, when the systems operate on a two-dimensional grid.
genetic variation in jasmonic acid- and spider mite-induced plant volatile emission of cucumber accessions and attraction of the predator phytoseiulus persimilis abstract after herbivore attack, plants launch a suite of direct and indirect defense responses that must be coordinated if plants are to realize a fitness benefit from these responses. here we characterize the volatile emissions in the native tobacco plant, nicotiana attenuata torr. ex wats., that are elicited by tobacco hornworm (manduca sexta l.) attack and are known to function as attractants for parasitoids. to provide the first ecophysiological comparison of examples of both types of defense in the same species, we characterize the elicitation and signaling mechanisms, the resources required, and the potential costs and benefits of the volatile release and compare these traits with those of the well-described induced direct defense in this species, nicotine production. the release of (e)-β-ocimene, cis-α-bergamotene and linalool is dramatically induced within 24 h by application of methyl jasmonate (meja), caterpillar feeding, and the treatment of mechanical wounds with larval oral secretions (os), but not by mechanical damage alone. plants from different geographic locations produce volatile blends that differ in composition. the most consistently released component from all genotypes, cis-α-berga-motene, is positively related to the amount of meja and the level of wounding if os are applied to the wounds. the volatile release is strongly light dependent, dropping to undetectable quantities during dark periods, even when temperatures are elevated to match those of the light period. inhibitors of wound-induced jasmonate accumulation (salicylates and auxins), which are known to inhibit wound-induced nicotine production, do not inhibit the release of volatiles. by individually inducing different leaf positions with os and, on other plants, excising them after induction, we demonstrate that the emission is largely a systemic, whole-plant response, which is maximally triggered when the second fully expanded leaf is induced. we conclude that while both are whole-plant, systemic responses that utilize recently acquired resources for their production and are activated by the jasmonate cascade, the elicitation of the volatile release exhibits greater tissue sensitivity and utilizes additional signaling components than does nicotine production. in contrast to the large investment of fitness-limiting resources required for induced nicotine production or the resources used in benzyl acetone release from flowers for pollinator attraction, the resource requirements for the volatile release are minor. hence the argument that the volatile release incurs comparatively large physiological costs cannot be supported in this system.
tmem74 promotes tumor cell survival by inducing autophagy via interactions with atg16l1 and atg9a macroautophagy (commonly referred to as autophagy) is the process by which intact organelles and/or large portions of the cytoplasm are engulfed within double-membraned autophagic vacuoles for degradation. whereas basal levels of autophagy ensure the physiological turnover of old and damaged organelles, the massive accumulation of autophagic vacuoles may represent either an alternative pathway of cell death or an ultimate attempt for cells to survive by adapting to stress. the activation of the autophagic pathway beyond a certain threshold may promote cell death directly, by causing the collapse of cellular functions as a result of cellular atrophy (autophagic, or type ii, cell death). alternatively, autophagy can lead to the execution of apoptotic (type i) or necrotic (type iii) cell death programs, presumably via common regulators such as proteins from the bcl-2 family. on the other hand, limited self-eating can provide cells with metabolic substrates to meet their energetic demands under stressful conditions, such as nutrient deprivation, or favor the selective elimination of damaged (and potentially dangerous) organelles. in these instances, autophagy operates as a pro-survival mechanism. the coordinate regulation of these opposite effects of autophagy relies upon a complex network of signal transducers, most of which also participate in non-autophagic signaling cascades. thus, autophagy occupies a crucial position within the cell's metabolism, and its modulation may represent an alternative therapeutic strategy in several pathological settings including cancer and neurodegeneration. here, we present a general outline of autophagy followed by a detailed analysis of organelle-specific autophagic pathways and of their intimate connections with cell death.
attentional states influence early neural responses associated with motivational processes: local vs. global attentional scope and n1 amplitude to appetitive stimuli event-related brain potentials (erps) provide high-resolution measures of the time course of neuronal activity patterns associated with perceptual and cognitive processes. new techniques for erp source analysis and comparisons with data from blood-flow neuroimaging studies enable improved localization of cortical activity during visual selective attention. erp modulations during spatial attention point toward a mechanism of gain control over information flow in extrastriate visual cortical pathways, starting about 80 ms after stimulus onset. paying attention to nonspatial features such as color, motion, or shape is manifested by qualitatively different erp patterns in multiple cortical areas that begin with latencies of 100-150 ms. the processing of nonspatial features seems to be contingent upon the prior selection of location, consistent with early selection theories of attention and with the hypothesis that spatial attention is "special."
is the ecura system useful for selecting patients who require radical surgery after noncurative endoscopic submucosal dissection for early gastric cancer? a comparative study backgroundalthough radical surgery is routinely performed for patients who do not meet the curative criteria for endoscopic submucosal dissection (esd) for early gastric cancer (egc) due to the risk of lymph node metastasis (lnm), this standard therapeutic option may be excessive given the lower number of patients with lnm. therefore, we aimed to investigate long-term outcomes and validate risk factors predicting recurrence after esd.methodsof 15,785 patients who underwent esd for egc at 19 institutions between 2000 and 2011, 1969 patients not meeting the curative criteria were included in this multi-center study. based on the treatment strategy after esd, patients were divided into radical surgery (n = 1064) and follow-up (no additional treatment, n = 905) groups.resultsoverall survival (os) and disease-specific survival (dss) were significantly higher in the radical surgery group than in the follow-up group (p < 0.001 and p = 0.012, respectively). however, the difference in 3-year dss between the groups (99.4 vs. 98.7 %) was rather small compared with the difference in 3-year os (96.7 vs. 84.0 %). lnm was found in 89 patients (8.4 %) in the radical surgery group. lymphatic invasion was found to be an independent risk factor for recurrence in the follow-up group (hazard ratio 5.23; 95 % confidence interval 2.01–13.6; p = 0.001).conclusionsthis multi-center study, representing the largest cohort to date, revealed a large discrepancy between os and dss in the two groups. since follow-up with no additional treatment after esd may be an acceptable option for patients at low risk, further risk stratification is needed for appropriate individualized treatment strategies.
enhancing quality in diffusion tensor imaging with anisotropic anomalous diffusion filter to compare the effects of anisotropic and gaussian smoothing on the outcomes of diffusion tensor imaging (dti) voxel‐based (vb) analyses in the clinic, in terms of signal‐to‐noise ratio (snr) enhancement and directional information and boundary structures preservation.
the mind in the machine: anthropomorphism increases trust in an autonomous vehicle anthropomorphism describes the tendency to imbue the real or imagined behavior of nonhuman agents with humanlike characteristics, motivations, intentions, or emotions. although surprisingly common, anthropomorphism is not invariant. this article describes a theory to explain when people are likely to anthropomorphize and when they are not, focused on three psychological determinants--the accessibility and applicability of anthropocentric knowledge (elicited agent knowledge), the motivation to explain and understand the behavior of other agents (effectance motivation), and the desire for social contact and affiliation (sociality motivation). this theory predicts that people are more likely to anthropomorphize when anthropocentric knowledge is accessible and applicable, when motivated to be effective social agents, and when lacking a sense of social connection to other humans. these factors help to explain why anthropomorphism is so variable; organize diverse research; and offer testable predictions about dispositional, situational, developmental, and cultural influences on anthropomorphism. discussion addresses extensions of this theory into the specific psychological processes underlying anthropomorphism, applications of this theory into robotics and human-computer interaction, and the insights offered by this theory into the inverse process of dehumanization.
dependent partitioning in this paper we consider productivity challenges for parallel programmers and explore ways that parallel language design might help improve end-user productivity. we offer a candidate list of desirable qualities for a parallel programming language, and describe how these qualities are addressed in the design of the chapel language. in doing so, we provide an overview of chapel's features and how they help address parallel productivity. we also survey current techniques for parallel programming and describe ways in which we consider them to fall short of our idealized productive programming model.
nurse-led risk assessment/management clinics reduce predicted cardiac morbidity and mortality in claudicants. objective to determine critical issues for future awareness programmes on peripheral arterial disease (pad).   design national dutch survey.   materials and methods a representative sample of 1294 members of the general population, and 281 patients with pad from the capi@home database were administered a questionnaire concerning awareness of pad.   results the response rate was 81% for the general population and 78% for patients with pad. the familiarity with pad terminology and symptoms amongst the general population was low. few patients (20%) were aware that pad was a disease of arteries. amongst both the general population and the patient populations, pad risk factors identification was low: hypertension (4% versus 0%); hypercholesterolaemia (9% versus 12%), diabetes (2% versus 8%), and smoking (27% versus 52%). knowledge was moderate in both populations about treatment with exercise, but low for smoking cessation. the general population was unaware of the central role of general practitioners in the treatment of pad.   conclusions the awareness of symptoms, risk factors, and treatment options for pad is low. both population and patients needed only minimal information to relate pad to other atherosclerotic diseases. based on the results of this survey the dutch platform of peripheral arterial disease together with the dutch heart foundation are initiating the first awareness campaign on atherosclerosis.
clinical and molecular characterization of turkish patients with familial hypomagnesaemia: novel mutations in trpm6 and cldn16 genes. magnesium plays an essential role in many biochemical and physiological processes. homeostasis of magnesium is tightly regulated and depends on the balance between intestinal absorption and renal excretion. during the last decades, various hereditary disorders of magnesium handling have been clinically characterized and genetic studies in affected individuals have led to the identification of some molecular components of cellular magnesium transport. in addition to these hereditary forms of magnesium deficiency, recent studies have revealed a high prevalence of latent hypomagnesemia in the general population. this finding is of special interest in view of the association between hypomagnesemia and common chronic diseases such as diabetes, coronary heart disease, hypertension, and asthma. however, valuable methods for the diagnosis of body and tissue magnesium deficiency are still lacking. this review focuses on clinical and genetic aspects of hereditary disorders of magnesium homeostasis. we will review primary defects of epithelial magnesium transport, disorders associated with defects in ca2+/ mg2+ sensing, as well as diseases characterized by renal salt wasting and hypokalemic alkalosis, with special emphasis on disturbed magnesium homeostasis.
the in vivo dynamic fatigue response of the spine to sudden loading in the sagittal plane: effects of pre-load and step input magnitude. objective to evaluate the impact of muscle pre-activation levels and load magnitude on the response of the trunk to loading conditions causing rapid flexion.   design eight male subjects were asked to maintain an upright standing posture while resisting the application of forward flexion moments produced by four different loading conditions consisting of combinations of two pre-loads (4% or 16% of the maximum extensor moment) and two added loads (12% or 24%). pre-loading was used to develop different initial levels of trunk muscle activity prior to the application of the added loads. of special interest were the two conditions that resulted in total final loads of 28%.   background cocontraction of the antagonistic and agonistic muscles of the trunk are required to provide stability during normal physiological loading conditions. in several in vivo studies, levels of trunk muscle cocontraction have been observed prior to the application of unexpected or sudden loads. forces from the abdominal muscles have been proposed to provide stability when extensor moments are generated. the response of trunk muscles to rapid flexor moments would provide further insight into the dynamic stability mechanisms of the spine.   methods measurements were made of the trunk extensor moments, angular displacement of the trunk and unilateral surface emg amplitudes of three abdominal and three trunk extensor muscles. values were recorded during the isometric pre-load and for the maximum magnitude of each variable in response to the added load.   results higher pre-loads resulted in lower flexion rotations of the spine and higher added loads caused larger rotations. with increasing magnitudes of final loads, a corresponding increase in trunk extensor moments and trunk muscle cocontraction was observed. the largest activations were observed in the lumbar erector spinae and thoracic erector spinae muscles, while smaller yet substantial emg activity was observed in the internal oblique and external oblique. a comparison of the 28% loading conditions showed an increased response of the trunk to the [4 + 24] loading condition (with lower initial trunk stiffness) when compared to the [16 + 12] loading condition.   conclusions pre-activation of trunk extensor muscles can serve to reduce the flexion displacements caused by rapid loading. the abdominal oblique muscles, especially external oblique, will rapidly increase their activation levels in response to rapid loading. these changes are more pronounced when pre-activation levels are low, resulting in lower initial trunk stiffness and spine compression force. it is proposed that these factors will ultimately affect spine stability and the risk of injury.   relevance the results of this study provide insight into several mechanisms involved in the dynamic stability of the spine. injuries can be caused by unexpected and rapid loading of the spine. a study of the mechanisms available to respond to such perturbations is important to an understanding of spine mechanics and the etiology of low back injury.
data quality assessment and improvement abstract master data management (mdm) is a topic of increasing prominence both in the scientific and in the practitioners’ information systems (is) community. as a prerequisite for meeting strategic business requirements, such as compliance with regulations, business integration, or integrated customer management, mdm comprises numerous activities. one of the central activities is designing and maintaining the master data architecture. interestingly, though, the scientific community has remained almost silent with regard to the question as to how companies should proceed when designing the master data architecture. in order to shed light on this unexplored topic, the paper at hand presents the findings of a case study at bosch group. the case study shows that designing the master data architecture is a multidimensional task which requires balancing the interests of various organizational stakeholders, managing an array of technical opportunities, and meeting requirements of numerous master data classes. also, the case study suggests that taking advantage of architectural design patterns may be an appropriate way to adequately address the complexity of the task.
factors affecting unmet need for family planning in southern nations, nationalities and peoples region, ethiopia the southern nations, nationalities, and people's region of ethiopia (snnpr) is home to 11 million people constituting more than 45 language and ethnic groups, most of whom live in extremely poor rural communities. data for currently married, fecund women aged 15-49 from demographic surveys conducted in the snnpr in 1990 and 1997 are used to investigate contraceptive knowledge and communication, and the use and future need for family planning services in this population. this study focuses on how these processes are affected by household organization and women's status, and on their implications for population policies and programs. considerations of the implications of these results for understanding the fertility transition of a highly diverse african population under severe stress are presented. although household extension and polygamy characterize one-third of the women sampled, they do not affect the women's contraceptive behavior. women's literacy and autonomy are, by far, the most significant forces in the movement toward lower fertility in the region.
outcome of microdissection tese compared with conventional tese in non‐obstructive azoospermia: a systematic review in a population of non-obstructive azoospermia patients, the efficacy of microsurgical testicular sperm extraction (microtese) and conventional tese was evaluated in a randomized controlled study on 138 testicles, classified and paired in a 48-square table according to the different classes of the following three variables: patient plasma fsh concentration, orchidometry and testicular histology. sperm retrieval was positive in 21/22 testicles with hypospermatogenesis (11/11, 10/11; microtese, tese respectively), in 12/14 with maturation arrest (6/7, 6/7), in 16/22 with incomplete sertoli cell-only syndrome (8/11, 8/11), and in 16/80 with complete sertoli cell-only syndrome (11/40, 5/40). sperm recovery was positive in 5/24 patients with fsh concentration > or = 3 x maximum value of normal range (n) (4/12, 1/12), in 17/40 patients with 2n < or = fsh < 3n (9/20, 8/20), in 30/48 patients with n < fsh < 2n (17/24, 13/24), and in 13/26 patients with fsh = n (6/13, 7/13). regarding orchidometry, sperm recovery was positive in 11/18 testicles with volume (v) > or = 12 ml (6/9, 5/9), in 27/56 testicles with 8 ml < or = v < 12 ml (15/28, 12/28), and in 27/64 testicles with v < 8 ml (15/32, 12/32). fsh value and the surgical procedure were the two variables significantly (p < 0.05) predicting positive sperm retrieval.
the role of nuclear receptor nhr-64 in fat storage regulation in caenorhabditis elegans the nuclear receptor superfamily is comprised of over 150 different proteins that have evolved to mediate a complex array of extracellular signals into transcriptional responses. many, but not all, of these proteins directly bind to signaling molecules, which, because of their small lipophilic character, can easily enter the target cell. thus, unlike membrane-bound receptors, the nuclear receptors are intracellular and function to control the activity of target genes directly. in aggregate, these target genes comprise a genetic network whose coordinate activity defines the physiologic response. the purpose of this review is to establish the historical links between the steroid and nonsteroid receptor signaling systems, to chart the explosive development of the retinoid x receptor (rxr) heterodimer and orphan receptor family, to explain the impact of these discoveries on our understanding of the mechanisms of hormonal signaling, and, finally, to present emerging issues and implications of these studies for animal development, physiology, and human disease.
a case of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy without arrhythmias arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (arvc/d) is a heart muscle disease clinically characterized by life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. its prevalence has been estimated to vary from 1:2,500 to 1:5,000. arvc/d is a major cause of sudden death in the young and athletes. the pathology consists of a genetically determined dystrophy of the right ventricular myocardium with fibro-fatty replacement to such an extent that it leads to right ventricular aneurysms. the clinical picture may include: a subclinical phase without symptoms and with ventricular fibrillation being the first presentation; an electrical disorder with palpitations and syncope, due to tachyarrhythmias of right ventricular origin; right ventricular or biventricular pump failure, so severe as to require transplantation. the causative genes encode proteins of mechanical cell junctions (plakoglobin, plakophilin, desmoglein, desmocollin, desmoplakin) and account for intercalated disk remodeling. familiar occurrence with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and variable penetrance has been proven. recessive variants associated with palmoplantar keratoderma and woolly hair have been also reported. clinical diagnosis may be achieved by demonstrating functional and structural alterations of the right ventricle, depolarization and repolarization abnormalities, arrhythmias with the left bundle branch block morphology and fibro-fatty replacement through endomyocardial biopsy. two dimensional echo, angiography and magnetic resonance are the imaging tools for visualizing structural-functional abnormalities. electroanatomic mapping is able to detect areas of low voltage corresponding to myocardial atrophy with fibro-fatty replacement. the main differential diagnoses are idiopathic right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia, myocarditis, dialted cardiomyopathy and sarcoidosis. only palliative therapy is available and consists of antiarrhythmic drugs, catheter ablation and implantable cardioverter defibrillator. young age, family history of juvenile sudden death, qrs dispersion ≥ 40 ms, t-wave inversion, left ventricular involvement, ventricular tachycardia, syncope and previous cardiac arrest are the major risk factors for adverse prognosis. preparticipation screening for sport eligibility has been proven to be effective in detecting asymptomatic patients and sport disqualification has been life-saving, substantially declining sudden death in young athletes.
provenance-based reproducibility in the semantic web through technologies such as rss (really simple syndication), web services, and ajax (asynchronous javascript and xml), the internet has facilitated the emergence of applications that are composed from a variety of services and data sources. through tools such as yahoo pipes, these “mash-ups” can be composed in a dynamic, just-in-time manner from components provided by multiple institutions (i.e., google, amazon, your neighbor). however, when using these applications, it is not apparent where data comes from or how it is processed. thus, to inspire trust and confidence in mash-ups, it is critical to be able to analyze their processes after the fact. these trailing analyses, in particular the determination of the provenance of a result (i.e., the process that led to it), are enabled by process documentation, which is documentation of an application's past process created by the components of that application at execution time. in this article, we define a generic conceptual data model that supports the autonomous creation of attributable, factual process documentation for dynamic multi-institutional applications. the data model is instantiated using two internet formats, owl and xml, and is evaluated with respect to questions about the provenance of results generated by a complex bioinformatics mash-up.
first detection of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus in the tick species haemaphysalis concinna in shandong province, china objectives to summarize the epidemiological characteristics of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (sfts) in zhejiang province, china.   methods a standardized questionnaire was used to collect information on demographic features, exposure history, clinical symptoms, and timelines of medical visits. descriptive statistics were used to analyze the characteristics of sfts.   results a total of 65 cases of sfts were identified in zhejiang province from 2011 to 2013, of whom 34 were male and 31 were female. the median age was 66 years and 60 cases occurred in persons aged ≥ 50 years. the majority (91%) of sfts cases occurred between may and august. with regard to exposure history, patients had pursued outdoor activities (63%), had a history of exposure to a tick (68%) or tick bite (29%), bred domestic animals (31%), or had a history of exposure to a mouse (57%), and some patients had a multi-exposure history. approximately 98.46% of patients were hospitalized, and symptoms of the illness included fever (98%), fatigue (71%), chills (51%), etc. two family clusters occurred, although there was no person-to-person transmission.   conclusions in zhejiang province, sfts is prevalent between may and august among elderly persons who live in hilly areas, and clinical features are not specific. more emphasis should be given to this disease and further training of medical personnel should be carried out to prevent misdiagnosis.
assessing biodiversity integrity for the conservation of grazed and burnt grassland systems: avian field metabolic rates as a rapid assessment tool in this study, we investigated the responses of two faunal groups, birds and arthropods, to varying degrees of disturbance caused by fire and grazing in south africa, eight study sites of varying fire frequency and stocking density were studied over two summer seasons (october–march). bird assemblages reflected habitat disturbance in a diversity of ways, driven by factors ranging from direct disturbance to changes in habitat structure and functioning, and shifts in food availability. similarly, arthropod diversity and abundance changed seasonally in response to management practices. fire frequency drives faunal assemblage structure and abundance and, in most cases, overrides the effects of grazing at all taxonomic levels. in particular, fire frequency strongly influenced grassland-breeding birds because farms are burnt in the territory-forming stage of the breeding cycle. insectivores and nectarivores were disproportionately impacted by intensive commercial management. of particular concern in this system is the yellow-breasted pipit (anthus chloris), which is regionally and globally vulnerable because of habitat loss. this species is sensitive to any form of habitat disturbance, highlighting the need for conservation attention in these grasslands. of the ten arthropod orders present in the study area, only orthoptera responded positively to burning. however, orthopterans made up on average 78% of arthropod biomass in moist highland grasslands, resulting in high grasshopper biomass on annually burnt farms: this high biomass in turn supports an abundance of insectivores. this reinforces the importance of process-oriented data where a measure of performance, such as reproductive success, is considered in assessing ecosystem condition.
the effect of prmt1-mediated arginine methylation on the subcellular localization, stress granules, and detergent-insoluble aggregates of fus/tls mutations in fused in sarcoma (fus) are a cause of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fals). patients carrying point mutations in the c‐terminus of fus show neuronal cytoplasmic fus‐positive inclusions, whereas in healthy controls, fus is predominantly nuclear. cytoplasmic fus inclusions have also been identified in a subset of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (ftld‐fus). we show that a non‐classical py nuclear localization signal (nls) in the c‐terminus of fus is necessary for nuclear import. the majority of fals‐associated mutations occur within the nls and impair nuclear import to a degree that correlates with the age of disease onset. this presents the first case of disease‐causing mutations within a py‐nls. nuclear import of fus is dependent on transportin, and interference with this transport pathway leads to cytoplasmic redistribution and recruitment of fus into stress granules. moreover, proteins known to be stress granule markers co‐deposit with inclusions in fals and ftld‐fus patients, implicating stress granule formation in the pathogenesis of these diseases. we propose that two pathological hits, namely nuclear import defects and cellular stress, are involved in the pathogenesis of fus‐opathies.
gregarious sexual segregation: the unusual social organization of the malagasy narrow-striped mongoose (mungotictis decemlineata) the diversity of extant carnivores provides valuable opportunities for comparative research to illuminate general patterns of mammalian social evolution. recent field studies on mongooses (herpestidae), in particular, have generated detailed behavioural and demographic data allowing tests of assumptions and predictions of theories of social evolution. the first studies of the social systems of their closest relatives, the malagasy eupleridae, also have been initiated. the literature on mongooses was last reviewed over 25 years ago. in this review, we summarise the current state of knowledge on the social organisation, mating systems and social structure (especially competition and cooperation) of the two mongoose families. our second aim is to evaluate the contributions of these studies to a better understanding of mammalian social evolution in general. based on published reports or anecdotal information, we can classify 16 of the 34 species of herpestidae as solitary and nine as group‐living; there are insufficient data available for the remainder. there is a strong phylogenetic signal of sociality with permanent complex groups being limited to the genera crossarchus, helogale, liberiictis, mungos, and suricata. our review also indicates that studies of solitary and social mongooses have been conducted within different theoretical frameworks: whereas solitary species and transitions to gregariousness have been mainly investigated in relation to ecological determinants, the study of social patterns of highly social mongooses has instead been based on reproductive skew theory. in some group‐living species, group size and composition were found to determine reproductive competition and cooperative breeding through group augmentation. infanticide risk and inbreeding avoidance connect social organisation and social structure with reproductive tactics and life histories, but their specific impact on mongoose sociality is still difficult to evaluate. however, the level of reproductive skew in social mongooses is not only determined by the costs and benefits of suppressing each other's breeding attempts, but also influenced by resource abundance. thus, dispersal, as a consequence of eviction, is also linked to the costs of co‐breeding in the context of food competition. by linking these facts, we show that the socio‐ecological model and reproductive skew theory share some determinants of social patterns. we also conclude that due to their long bio‐geographical isolation and divergent selection pressures, future studies of the social systems of the eupleridae will be of great value for the elucidation of general patterns in carnivore social evolution.
the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders in west pomeranian and pomeranian regions of poland summarybasing case selection on behavioural criteria, the entire 8–10 year old population of the county of middlesex was screened to identify children with autistic behaviour. screening was accomplished by behaviour questionnaires, completed by teachers or other supervisors, examination of case records and interviews with selected children and informants. among 54 children who were found to show some evidence of the syndrome, two “autistic” subgroups and one “non-autistic” subgroup were defined, according to ratings on 24 behavioural items. the 35 “autistic” cases represent a prevalence rate of 4.5 per 10,000. data for 32 of these were analyzed. boys were more common than girls in a ratio of 2.6 to 1. the relationship between early development, type of onset and i.q. at the survey mean age of 9 years 9 months, is discussed. the numbers of autistic children found are compared with those of children with other handicaps such as blindness. it is pointed out that sub-division according to the presence of developmental retardation is necessary for the useful comparison of reported groups, particularly with respect to estimates of prognosis.résuméen choisissant les cas selon des critères de comportement, toute la population âgée de 8–10 ans dans le comté du middlesex fut soigneusement examinée, afin d'identifier les enfants présentant un comportement, autiste. l'examen consista en questionnaires de comportement, complétés par les maîtres ou autres surveillants, l'examen des dossiers et des entretiens avec les enfants sélectionnés et les rapporteurs. parmi les 54 enfants chez qui l'on releva quelque évidence du syndrome, 2 sous-groupes »autistes« et un sous-groupe »non-autiste« furent définis, d'après les résultats de 24 items des tests de compontement. les 35 cas »autistes« représentent une proportion de 4,5 pour 10 000. les données concernant 32 de ces cas ont été analysées. il y avait plus de garçons que de filles dans le rapport de 2,6 pour 1. les relations entre le développement antérieur, le genre de l'affection actuelle et le q.i. à l'âge moyen lors de l'examen (9 ans 9 mois) sont discutées. le nombre d'enfants autistes trouvé est comparé au nombre d'enfants présentant d'autres handicaps, comme la cécité. on souligne, en ce qui concerne le retard du développement, la nécessité de faire des subdivisions, afin de pouvoir comparer utilement les groupes étudiés, en particulier quant aux estimations pronostiques.zusammenfassungvermittels einer fall-suche nach verhaltens-kriterien wurde die altersgruppe 8–10 jahre der population von middlesex durchgegangen, um kinder mit autistischem verhalten festzustellen. die einordnung erfolgte mit verhaltens-fragebögen (ausgefüllt durch lehrer oder andere erziehungspersonen), durch überprüfung von fall-geschichten und interviews mit ausgewählten kindern und sonstigen informanten. unter 54 kindern mit hinweisen auf ein autistisches syndrom konnten 2 „autistische“ untergruppen und eine „nichtautistische“ untergruppe gebildet werden, wenn die werte von 24 verhaltenskriterien zugrunde gelegt wurden. die 35 „autistischen“ fälle ergeben eine prävalenz-rate von 4,5 auf 10 000. die daten von 32 dieser fälle werden näher analysiert. jungen waren häufiger betroffen als mädchen, und zwar in einem verhältnis von 2,6∶1. die beziehung zwischen frühentwicklung, beginn des syndroms und i.q. wird diskutiert, vor allem im blick auf das mittlere alter der population zur zeit der untersuchung: 9 jahre, 9 monate. die zahlenwerte für autistische kinder werden mit solchen anderer gruppen geschädigter kinder (etwa blindheit) verglichen. eine unterteilung je nach vorhandensein eines entwicklungsrückstandes erscheint für einen fruchtbaren vergleich der berichteten gruppen und für prognostische schätzungen notwendig.
the impact of posterior temporary internal distraction on stepwise corrective surgery for extremely severe and rigid scoliosis greater than 130° background context to date, there are no clinical series documenting the treatment of severe and rigid scoliosis in patients with low body weight. to optimize curve correction and minimize the risk of complications, we performed a two-stage vertebral column resection (vcr) with posterior pedicle screw instrumentation to treat patients with severe and rigid scoliosis and low body weight.   purpose the purposes of this study were to report the results of a two-staged vcr for patients with severe and rigid scoliosis and low body weight.   study design this was a prospective, longitudinal, and descriptive study with a minimum follow-up of 2 years.   patient sample sixteen patients (nine women and seven men) with severe and rigid scoliosis and low body weight from the department of orthopedics, west china hospital, sichuan university.   outcome measures clinical analysis included rib hump and lumbar hump. radiographic analysis consisted of cobb angle measurements of coronal curves, apical vertebral translation, coronal balance, sagittal balance, thoracic kyphosis, and lumbar lordosis. all measurements were taken before surgery, after surgery, and in the final follow-up period.   methods for evaluation of surgical effectiveness, comparative analysis of rib hump, lumbar hump, cobb angle of coronal curves, apical vertebral translation, coronal balance, sagittal balance, thoracic kyphosis, and lumbar lordosis before operation, after operation, and at the most recent follow-up was done.   results the body weight of patients averaged 33.8 kg (range 27-40 kg). mean operating time was 580.3 minutes, with a blood loss of 1,581.3 ml. the correction rates of rib hump and lumbar hump were 77% and 85%. preoperative major curves ranged from 90° to 130° cobb angle. coronal plane correction of the major curve averaged 70.7%, with an average loss of correction of 1.8%. the apical vertebral translation of the major curve was corrected by 73.2%. the preoperative coronal imbalance of 0.6 cm (range 0-1.4 cm) was improved to 0.5 cm (range 0-1.4 cm) at the most recent follow-up. the preoperative sagittal imbalance of 0.9 cm (range -3.1 to 4.6 cm) was improved to 0.8 cm (range -1.0 to 3.0 cm) at the most recent follow-up. the preoperative thoracic kyphosis of 50.1° (range 6°-86°) was corrected to 28.9°±7.7° (range 18°-42°) at the most recent follow-up. the preoperative lumbar lordosis of -57.9° (range -85° to -32°) was corrected to -49.0° (range -62° to -40°) at the most recent follow-up. complications were encountered in two patients. one patient required ventilator support for 12 hours after anterior surgery. malposition of one pedicle screw was found in one patient. there were no neurologic complications or any deep wound infections. no complication of instrumentation was found at final follow-up.   conclusions the use of two-stage vcr for patients with severe and rigid scoliosis and low body weight can achieve a good correction of scoliosis without serious complications.
on clique-transversals and clique-independent sets abstract a minimum clique-transversal set mct ( g ) of a graph g =( v , e ) is a set s ⊆ v of minimum cardinality that meets all maximal cliques in g . a maximum clique-independent set mci ( g ) of g is a set of maximum number of pairwise vertex-disjoint maximal cliques. we prove that the problem of finding an mct ( g ) and an mci ( g ) is np -hard for cocomparability, planar, line and total graphs. as an interesting corollary we obtain that the problem of finding a minimum number of elements of a poset to meet all maximal antichains of the poset remains np -hard even if the poset has height two, thereby generalizing a result of duffas et al. (j. combin. theory ser. a 58 (1991) 158–164). we present a polynomial algorithm for the above problems on helly circular-arc graphs which is the first such algorithm for a class of graphs that is not clique-perfect . we also present polynomial algorithms for the weighted version of the clique-transversal problem on strongly chordal graphs, chordal graphs of bounded clique size, and cographs. the algorithms presented run in linear time for strongly chordal graphs and cographs. these mark the first attempts at the weighted version of the problem.
exclusion-proneness in borderline personality disorder inpatients impairs alliance in mentalization-based group therapy objective the purpose of this study was to characterize the course of 24 symptoms of borderline personality disorder in terms of time to remission.   method the borderline psychopathology of 362 patients with personality disorders, all recruited during inpatient stays, was assessed using two semistructured interviews of proven reliability. of these, 290 patients met dsm-iii-r criteria as well as revised diagnostic interview for borderlines criteria for borderline personality disorder, and 72 met dsm-iii-r criteria for another axis ii disorder. over 85% of the patients were reinterviewed at five distinct 2-year follow-up waves by interviewers blind to all previously collected information.   results among borderline patients, 12 of the 24 symptoms studied showed patterns of sharp decline over time and were reported at 10-year follow-up by less than 15% of the patients who reported them at baseline. the other 12 symptoms showed patterns of substantial but less dramatic decline over the follow-up period. symptoms reflecting core areas of impulsivity (e.g., self-mutilation and suicide efforts) and active attempts to manage interpersonal difficulties (e.g., problems with demandingness/entitlement and serious treatment regressions) seemed to resolve the most quickly. in contrast, affective symptoms reflecting areas of chronic dysphoria (e.g., anger and loneliness/emptiness) and interpersonal symptoms reflecting abandonment and dependency issues (e.g., intolerance of aloneness and counterdependency problems) seemed to be the most stable.   conclusions the results suggest that borderline personality disorder may consist of both symptoms that are manifestations of acute illness and symptoms that represent more enduring aspects of the disorder.
associations between osteoprotegerin polymorphisms and bone mineral density: a meta-analysis given that osteoprotegerin plays an important role in bone remodeling, the osteoprotegerin gene may be a candidate locus for susceptibility to osteoporosis. the relation of polymorphisms in the promoter of the osteoprotegerin gene to bone mineral density (bmd) was examined in a japanese population-based prospective cohort study with randomly recruited subjects (1095 women and 1125 men for the 950t --> c polymorphism, 1094 women and 1127 men for the 245t --> g polymorphism). bmd at the radius was measured by peripheral quantitative computed tomography, and that for the total body, lumbar spine, right femoral neck, right trochanter, and right ward's triangle was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. genotypes were determined with a fluorescence-based allele-specific dna primer assay system. among 950t --> c genotypes, bmd for the proximal radius was lower in premenopausal women with the cc genotype than in those with the tt or tc genotype; the difference in bmd between the two groups was 3.9% (p=0.0075). among 245t --> g genotypes, bmd for the radius, total body, femoral neck, trochanter, and ward's triangle was lower in postmenopausal women with the gg genotype than in those with the tt or tg genotype, the tt genotype, or the tg genotype; the differences in bmd between the gg genotype and the tt or tg genotype were 19.8% for the distal radius (p=0.0015), 13.1% for the proximal radius (p=0.0095), 11.2% for the total body (p=0.0013), 12.9% for the femoral neck (p=0.0067), 18.7% for the trochanter (p=0.0008), and 27.1% for ward's triangle (p=0.0038). bmd was not associated with the 950t --> c or 245t --> g genotypes in men. the present results implicate the osteoprotegerin gene as a susceptibility locus for reduced bmd in japanese women.
glial and neuronal damage markers in patients with anorexia nervosa glial fibrillary acidic protein (gfap), found only in glial cells of the central nervous system (cns) (1)(2), was first isolated by eng et al. (1) in 1971. gfap is a monomeric molecule with a molecular mass between 40 and 53 kda (3)(4) and an isoelectric point between 5.7 and 5.8 (2). gfap represents the major part of the cytoskeleton of astrocytes. dearmond et al. (5) reported on the spontaneous degradation of gfap in vitro and in vivo; under physiological conditions, gfap polymerizes spontaneously to astrofibrils with a length of 0.8–1.06 μm.  numerous reports in the literature document the usefulness of measuring gfap in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) as a specific indicator of cns pathology (6)(7)(8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13). measuring gfap in blood would have clinical advantages over csf measurements; however, to our knowledge, the only method attempted to date to measure gfap in blood (14) was not successful.  we describe the results of measuring the concentrations of both gfap and s-100 protein in the blood of patients with acute severe head trauma and healthy controls, using the dissociation-enhanced lanthanide fluorescence immunoassay (delfia) system for detection of gfap (delfia can also be used to measure the concentration of gfap in csf).  blood samples were obtained from 25 patients (19 males and 6 females; ages, 16–72 years; mean age, 38.6 ± 19.0 years) who were admitted <24 h after severe head trauma (a glasgow coma scale score of ≤6 on admission). three samples were obtained from each patient: the first sample was obtained on admission to the hospital, the second was obtained 24 h after the head injury, and the third was obtained 48 h after the injury.  blood samples were also obtained from 70 healthy blood donors …
cep290 interacts with the centriolar satellite component pcm-1 and is required for rab8 localization to the primary cilium. bbs4 is one of several proteins that cause bardet-biedl syndrome (bbs), a multisystemic disorder of genetic and clinical complexity. here we show that bbs4 localizes to the centriolar satellites of centrosomes and basal bodies of primary cilia, where it functions as an adaptor of the p150glued subunit of the dynein transport machinery to recruit pcm1 (pericentriolar material 1 protein) and its associated cargo to the satellites. silencing of bbs4 induces pcm1 mislocalization and concomitant deanchoring of centrosomal microtubules, arrest in cell division and apoptotic cell death. expression of two truncated forms of bbs4 that are similar to those found in some individuals with bbs had a similar effect on pcm1 and microtubules. our findings indicate that defective targeting or anchoring of pericentriolar proteins and microtubule disorganization contribute to the bbs phenotype and provide new insights into possible causes of familial obesity, diabetes and retinal degeneration.
mammalian target of rapamycin regulates nox4-mediated podocyte depletion in diabetic renal injury objective—to investigate potential mechanisms of oxidative dna damage in a rat model of type 1 diabetes and in murine proximal tubular epithelial cells and primary culture of rat proximal tubular epithelial cells. research design and methods—phosphorylation of akt and tuberin, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodg) levels, and 8-oxog-dna glycosylase (ogg1) expression were measured in kidney cortical tissue of control and type 1 diabetic animals and in proximal tubular cells incubated with normal or high glucose. results—in the renal cortex of diabetic rats, the increase in akt phosphorylation is associated with enhanced phosphorylation of tuberin, decreased ogg1 protein expression, and 8-oxodg accumulation. exposure of proximal tubular epithelial cells to high glucose causes a rapid increase in reactive oxygen species (ros) generation that correlates with the increase in akt and tuberin phosphorylation. high glucose also resulted in downregulation of ogg1 protein expression, paralleling its effect on akt and tuberin. inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/akt significantly reduced high glucose–induced tuberin phosphorylation and restored ogg1 expression. hydrogen peroxide stimulates akt and tuberin phosphorylation and decreases ogg1 protein expression. the antioxidant n-acetylcysteine significantly inhibited ros generation, akt/protein kinase b, and tuberin phosphorylation and resulted in deceased 8-oxodg accumulation and upregulation of ogg1 protein expression. conclusions—hyperglycemia in type 1 diabetes and treatment of proximal tubular epithelial cells with high glucose leads to phosphorylation/inactivation of tuberin and downregulation of ogg1 via a redox-dependent activation of akt in renal tubular epithelial cells. this signaling cascade provides a mechanism of oxidative stress–mediated dna damage in diabetes.
identification of a 1.6 kb genome locus of guinea pig cytomegalovirus required for efficient viral growth in animals but not in cell culture. abstract chemokines are important mediators of the early inflammatory response to infection and modify a wide range of host immune responses. functional homologs of cellular chemokines have been identified in a number of herpesviruses, suggesting that the subversion of the host chemokine response contributes to the pathogenesis of these viruses. transcriptional and reverse transcription-pcr analyses demonstrated that the murine cytomegalovirus (mcmv) chemokine homolog, m131, was spliced at the 3′ end to the adjacent downstream open reading frame, m129, resulting in a predicted product of 31 kda, which is significantly larger than most known chemokines. the in vivo impact of m131/129 was investigated by comparing the replication of mcmv mutants having m131/129 deleted (δm131/129) with that of wild-type (wt) mcmv. our studies demonstrate that both wt and δm131/129 viruses replicated to equivalent levels during the first 2 to 3 days following in vivo infection. however, histological studies demonstrated that the early inflammatory response elicited by δm131/129 was reduced compared with that of wt mcmv. furthermore, the δm131/129 mutants failed to establish a high-titer infection in the salivary glands. these results suggest that m131/129 possesses proinflammatory properties in vivo and is important for the dissemination of mcmv to or infection of the salivary gland. notably, the δm131/129 mutants were cleared more rapidly from the spleen and liver during acute infection compared with wt mcmv. the accelerated clearance of the mutants was dependent on nk cells and cells of the cd4+ cd8+ phenotype. these data suggest that m131/129 may also contribute to virus mechanisms of immune system evasion during early infection, possibly through the interference of nk cells and t cells.
properties of human blood monocytes. i. cd91 expression and log orthogonal light scatter provide a robust method to identify monocytes that is more accurate than cd14 expression tumor-associated macrophages (tams) are key orchestrators of the tumor microenvironment directly affecting neoplastic cell growth, neoangiogenesis, and extracellular matrix remodeling. in turn, the tumor milieu strongly influences maturation of tams and shapes several of their features. to address the early macrophage (mϕ) differentiation phase in a malignant context, we mimicked a tumor microenvironment by in vitro coculturing human blood monocytes with conditioned media from different cancer cell lines. only 2 out of 16 tumor cell lines induced mϕ differentiation due to secreted m-csf isoforms, including high molecular mass species. a global gene profiling of tumor-conditioned mϕ was performed. comparison with other datasets (polarized m1-mϕ, m2-mϕ, and tams isolated from human tumors) highlighted the upregulation of several genes also shared by tam and m2-polarized mϕ. the most expressed genes were selenoprotein 1, osteoactivin, osteopontin, and, interestingly, migration-stimulating factor (msf), a poorly studied oncofoetal isoform of fibronectin. msf (present in fetal/cancer epithelial and stromal cells but not in healthy tissues) was never identified in mϕ. msf production was confirmed by immunohistochemistry in human tams. msf was induced by m-csf, il-4, and tgfβ but not by proinflammatory stimuli. rna and protein analysis clearly demonstrated that it is specifically associated with the m2 polarization of mϕ. tumor-conditioned mϕ-derived msfs strongly stimulated tumor cell migration, thus contributing to the motile phenotype of neoplastic cells. in conclusion, msf is a new molecule associated with the m2 polarization of mϕ and expressed by tams. its biological function may contribute to mϕ-mediated promotion of cancer cell invasion and metastasis.
enhancing ptb universal dependencies for grammar-based surface realization this article presents an algorithm for translating the penn treebank into a corpus of combinatory categorial grammar (ccg) derivations augmented with local and long-range word-word dependencies. the resulting corpus, ccgbank, includes 99.4% of the sentences in the penn treebank. it is available from the linguistic data consortium, and has been used to train wide-coverage statistical parsers that obtain state-of-the-art rates of dependency recovery. in order to obtain linguistically adequate ccg analyses, and to eliminate noise and inconsistencies in the original annotation, an extensive analysis of the constructions and annotations in the penn treebank was called for, and a substantial number of changes to the treebank were necessary. we discuss the implications of our findings for the extraction of other linguistically expressive grammars from the treebank, and for the design of future treebanks.
proteome changes in the initial bacterial colonist during ecological succession in an acid mine drainage biofilm community. bacterial species concepts are controversial. more widely accepted is the need to understand how differences in gene content and sequence lead to ecological divergence. to address this relationship in ecosystem context, we investigated links between genotype and ecology of two genotypic groups of leptospirillum group ii bacteria in comprehensively characterized, natural acidophilic biofilm communities. these groups share 99.7% 16s rrna gene sequence identity and 95% average amino acid identity between their orthologs. one genotypic group predominates during early colonization, and the other group typically proliferates in later successional stages, forming distinct patches tens to hundreds of micrometers in diameter. among early colonizing populations, we observed dominance of five genotypes that differed from each other by the extent of recombination with the late colonizing type. our analyses suggest that the specific recombinant variant within the early colonizing group is selected for by environmental parameters such as temperature, consistent with recombination as a mechanism for ecological fine tuning. evolutionary signatures, and strain-resolved expression patterns measured via mass spectrometry–based proteomics, indicate increased cobalamin biosynthesis, (de)methylation, and glycine cleavage in the late colonizer. this may suggest environmental changes within the biofilm during development, accompanied by redirection of compatible solutes from osmoprotectants toward metabolism. across 27 communities, comparative proteogenomic analyses show that differential regulation of shared genes and expression of a small subset of the ∼15% of genes unique to each genotype are involved in niche partitioning. in summary, the results show how subtle genetic variations can lead to distinct ecological strategies.
apocynin attenuates left ventricular remodeling in diabetic rabbits increases in nadph oxidase activity, oxidative stress, and myocyte apoptosis coexist in failing hearts. in cardiac myocytes in vitro inhibition of nadph oxidase reduces apoptosis. in this study, we tested the hypothesis that nadph oxidase inhibition reduces myocyte apoptosis and improves cardiac function in heart failure after myocardial infarction (mi). rabbits with heart failure induced by mi and sham-operated animals were randomized to orally receive apocynin, an inhibitor of nadph oxidase (15 mg per day) or placebo for 4 weeks. left ventricular (lv) dimension and function were assessed by echocardiography and hemodynamics. myocardial nadph oxidase activity was measured by superoxide dismutase-inhibitable cytochrome c reduction assay, nadph oxidase subunit p47phox expression by western blot and immunofluorescence analysis, myocardial oxidative stress evaluated by 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-ohdg) and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-hne) using immunohistochemistry, and myocyte apoptosis by tunel assay. mi rabbits exhibited lv dilatation and systolic dysfunction measured by lv fractional shortening and the maximal rate of lv pressure rise (dp/dt). these changes were associated with increases in nadph oxidase activity, p47phox protein expression, 8-ohdg expression, 4-hne expression, myocyte apoptosis, and bax protein and a decrease in bcl-2 protein. apocynin reduced nadph oxidase activity, p47phox protein, oxidative stress, myocyte apoptosis, and bax protein, increased bcl-2 protein, and ameliorated lv dilatation and dysfunction after mi. the results suggest that inhibition of nadph oxidase may represent an attractive therapeutic approach to treat heart failure.
a versatile chemo-enzymatic conjugation approach yields homogeneous and highly potent antibody-drug conjugates the linker component of antibody-drug conjugates (adc) is a key feature in developing optimized therapeutic agents that are highly active at well tolerated doses. for maximal intratumoral drug delivery, linkers are required that are highly stable in the systemic circulation, yet allow for efficient drug release at the target site. in this respect, amide bond-based technologies constitute a technological advancement, since the linker half-lives in circulation ( t 1/2 approximately 7 days) are much longer than earlier generation linkers that break down within 1-2 days. the amide linkers, some of which contain peptides, are appended to the mab carriers through thioether/maleimide adducts. here, we describe that use of a bromoacetamidecaproyl (bac) in place of the maleimidocaproyl (mc) increases the plasma stability of resulting thioether adcs. one such adc, 1f6-c4v2-bac-mmaf, which is directed against the cd70 antigen on lymphomas and renal cell carcinoma, was prepared containing a bac thioether spacer between the drug (mmaf) and the mab carrier (1f6-c4v2). there was no measurable systemic drug release from this adc for 2 weeks postadministration in mice. in order to assess the impact of improving linker stability beyond mc containing adcs, a series of mc and bac-linked 1f6-mmaf conjugates were compared for tolerability, intratumoral drug delivery, and therapeutic efficacy in nude mice with renal cell carcinoma xenografts. there were no statistically significant efficacy differences between sets of mc and bac containing adcs, although the bac linker technology led to 25% higher intratumoral drug exposure over a 7 day period compared to the corresponding mc linker. the mechanism of drug release from maleimide-adducts likely involves a retro-michael reaction that takes place in plasma, based on in vitro studies demonstrating that some of the released drug-maleimide derivative became covalently bound to cysteine-34 of serum albumin. in summary, the data indicate that new linkers can be obtained with improved in vivo stability by replacing the maleimide with an acetamide, but the resulting adcs had similar tolerability and activity profiles.
influence of obesity and body fat distribution on postprandial lipemia and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in adult women. apoliprotein (apo) b-100-containing very low density lipoprotein (vldl) particles secreted from the liver accumulate in plasma during alimentary lipemia. to determine whether changes of vldl composition occur in the postprandial state that may render these lipoproteins more atherogenic, apoe, c-i, c-ii, and c-iii, and lipids (triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesterol) were measured in svedberg flotation (sf) 60-400 (large) and sf 20-60 (small) vldl before and after an oral fat load. ten normotriglyceridemic (ntg) and three hypertriglyceridemic (htg) healthy men were given a fat-rich mixed meal (1,000 kcal with 60.2 e% from fat). triglyceride-rich lipoproteins were isolated by density gradient ultracentrifugation from plasma samples obtained before (fasting) and at 2-h intervals after the meal. vldl was then separated from chylomicrons and their remnants by immunoaffinity chromatography using monoclonal antibodies 4g3 and 5e11, recognizing apob-100, but not apob-48 epitopes. large and small vldl isolated from the ntg group were enriched with apoe and c-i, and cholesterol, but depleted of apoc-ii in the postprandial state, whereas the apoc-iii, triglyceride, and phospholipid contents were essentially unchanged. the compositional changes of vldl in htg subjects were similar but more pronounced compared with ntg subjects. we conclude that postprandial lipemia in healthy men induces transient compositional alterations of vldl that link these lipoprotein species to the formation of atherosclerosis.
speech disorders in parkinson’s disease: early diagnostics and effects of medication and brain stimulation different characterization approaches, including nonlinear dynamics (nld), have been addressed for the automatic detection of pd; however, the obtained discrimination capability when only nld features are considered has not been evaluated yet.
“gut-feeling” or evidence-based approaches in the evaluation and treatment of human short-bowel syndrome the management of short bowel syndrome requires long‐term nutritional support and monitoring, medication, and occasionally additional surgical procedures. constant attention is required to ensure adequate adaptation of the gut. this article reviews the normal function of the small bowel, adaptation following resection, total parenteral and enteral nutrition, and the role of adjunctive surgical procedures in the management of short bowel syndrome.
layer-specific interference with cholinergic signaling in the prefrontal cortex by smoking concentrations of nicotine adolescence is a critical period of brain development during which maturation of areas involved in cognitive functioning, such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mpfc), is still ongoing. tobacco smoking during this age can compromise the normal course of prefrontal development and lead to cognitive impairments in later life. recently, we reported that nicotine exposure during adolescence results in a short-term increase and lasting reduction in synaptic mglur2 levels in the rat mpfc, causing attention deficits during adulthood. it is unknown how changed synaptic mglur2 levels after adolescent nicotine exposure affect the ability of mpfc synapses to undergo long-term synaptic plasticity. here, we addressed this question. to model nicotine exposure, adolescent (p34–p43) or adult (p60–p69) rats were treated with nicotine injections three times per day for 10 d. we found that, both during acute activation of nicotinic receptors in the adolescent mpfc as well as immediately following nicotine treatment during adolescence, long-term plasticity in response to timed presynaptic and postsynaptic activity (tltp) was strongly reduced. in contrast, in the mpfc of adult rats 5 weeks after they received nicotine treatment during adolescence, but not during adulthood, tltp was increased. short- and long-term adaptation of mpfc synaptic plasticity after adolescent nicotine exposure could be explained by changed mglur2 signaling. blocking mglur2s augmented tltp, whereas activating mglur2s reduced tltp. our findings suggest neuronal mechanisms by which exposure to nicotine during adolescence alters the rules for spike timing-dependent plasticity in prefrontal networks that may explain the observed deficits in cognitive performance in later life.
nevus comedonicus: a case series abstract: we report extensive nevus comedonicus in a female patient that involved half of her body entirely, with infected cystic lesions as well as typical scars, limited by the midline. the lesions worsened at the beginning of puberty. a brief review of the literature highlights the histopathologic, etiopathogenic, and therapeutic aspects.
expression of cyp 11 b 2 in aldosterone-producing adrenocortical adenoma : regulatory mechanisms and clinical significance primary aldosteronism is the most prevalent form of secondary hypertension. to explore molecular mechanisms of autonomous aldosterone secretion, we performed exome sequencing of aldosterone-producing adenomas (apas). we identified somatic hotspot mutations in the atp1a1 (encoding an na+/k+ atpase α subunit) and atp2b3 (encoding a ca2+ atpase) genes in three and two of the nine apas, respectively. these atpases are expressed in adrenal cells and control sodium, potassium and calcium ion homeostasis. functional in vitro studies of atp1a1 mutants showed loss of pump activity and strongly reduced affinity for potassium. electrophysiological ex vivo studies on primary adrenal adenoma cells provided further evidence for inappropriate depolarization of cells with atpase alterations. in a collection of 308 apas, we found 16 (5.2%) somatic mutations in atp1a1 and 5 (1.6%) in atp2b3. mutation-positive cases showed male dominance, increased plasma aldosterone concentrations and lower potassium concentrations compared with mutation-negative cases. in summary, dominant somatic alterations in two members of the atpase gene family result in autonomous aldosterone secretion.
genuine genetic redundancy in maleylacetate-reductase-encoding genes involved in degradation of haloaromatic compounds by cupriavidus necator jmp134. the maleylacetate reductase from pseudomonas sp. strain b13 functioning in the modified ortho pathway was purified and digested with trypsin. the polypeptides separated by high-performance liquid chromatography were sequenced. alignments with the polypeptides predicted from the tfdf and tcbf genes located on plasmids pjp4 of the 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate-degrading alcaligenes eutrophus jmp134 and pp51 of the 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene-degrading pseudomonas sp. strain p51 as well as polypeptides predicted from the tfte gene located on the chromosome of the 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetate-degrading burkholderia cepacia ac1100 were obtained. in addition, the deduced protein sequence encoded by the nucleotide sequence downstream of clcd on plasmid pac27 of the 3-chlorobenzoate-degrading pseudomonas putida ac866 was tested for homology. significant sequence similarities with the polypeptides encoded by the tfdf, tcbf, and tfte genes as well as the nucleotide sequence downstream of the clcd gene gave evidence that these genes might encode maleylacetate reductases. a nad-binding motif in a beta alpha beta-element was detected.
phylogenetic information and experimental design in molecular systematics summarythe application of maximum likelihood techniques to the estimation of evolutionary trees from nucleic acid sequence data is discussed. a computationally feasible method for finding such maximum likelihood estimates is developed, and a computer program is available. this method has advantages over the traditional parsimony algorithms, which can give misleading results if rates of evolution differ in different lineages. it also allows the testing of hypotheses about the constancy of evolutionary rates by likelihood ratio tests, and gives rough indication of the error of the estimate of the tree.
muscle side population cells from dystrophic or injured muscle adopt a fibro-adipogenic fate the multipotent nature of skeletal muscle-derived side population cells is demonstrated by their myogenic and hematopoietic potential in vivo. however, whether muscle side population cells are derived from the bone marrow is unclear. to study the long-term contribution of the hematopoietic system to muscle side population, whole bone marrow cells from ly5.1 males or from e-gfp transgenic male mice were transplanted into lethally irradiated ly5.2 females. long-term cell trafficking of donor bone marrow cells to muscle side population was monitored 17 times in a 34-week study. fluorescence-activated cell sorter analyses were used to detect ly5.1 and gfp+ donor cells, which were confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization of the y-chromosome. analyses post-transplantation indicated that whereas cells of donor origin could be found in the muscle, donor bone marrow cells had contributed little to the muscle side population. attempts to increase cell trafficking by induced muscle damage again confirmed that more than 90% of side population cells present in the muscle were derived from the host. these results demonstrate that muscle side population cells are not replenished by the bone marrow and suggest a non-hematopoietic origin for this cell population.
response styles to positive affect and depression: concurrent and prospective associations in a community sample the authors investigated whether the re-emergence of hopeless/suicidal cognitions over time can be explained within a differential activation framework. studies 1 (n = 146) and 2 (n = 136) showed that individuals who reported suicidal ideation when depressed in the past had higher scores on the hopelessness/suicidality subscale of a measure assessing cognitive reactivity to low mood, the leids. study 3 (n = 32) demonstrated that self-reports on this subscale predicted changes in generativity for positive future events, an experimental measure of processes underlying hopelessness/suicidality, following sad mood induction. the results provide preliminary evidence that history of suicidal ideation is related to a specific cognitive response pattern, which may be reactivated by mild fluctuations in mood.
forging a link between mentoring and collaboration: a new training model for implementation science objectives we studied 5 members of the national network consortium on tobacco control in priority populations. these networks, which consist of governmental and nongovernmental organizations, targeted lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender persons; asian americans, native hawaiians, and pacific islanders; american indians and alaska natives; african americans; and persons with low socioeconomic status, respectively.   methods we used statistical network analysis modeling to examine collaboration among these national networks in 2007.   results network size and composition varied, but all 5 networks had extensive interorganizational collaboration. location and work area were significant predictors of collaboration among network members in all 5 networks. organizations were more likely to collaborate with their network's lead agency; collaborations with other agencies were more likely if they were geographically close. collaboration was perceived to be important for achieving the goals of the national network.   conclusions the similarity of collaboration patterns across the 5 networks suggests common underlying partnership formation processes. statistical network modeling promises to be a useful tool for understanding how public health systems such as networks and coalitions can be used to improve the nation's health.
towards a framework of digital platform competition: a comparative study of monopolistic & federated mobile payment platforms i this essay, we argue that pervasive digitization gives birth to a new type of product architecture: the layered modular architecture. the layered modular architecture extends the modular architecture of physical products by incorporating four loosely coupled layers of devices, networks, services, and contents created by digital technology. we posit that this new architecture instigates profound changes in the ways that firms organize for innovation in the future. we develop (1) a conceptual framework to describe the emerging organizing logic of digital innovation and (2) an information systems research agenda for digital strategy and the creation and management of corporate information technology infrastructures.
interactive comment on “ observation of slant column no 2 using the super-zoom mode of aura-omi ” we present a new algorithm for the near-real time retrieval ? within 3 h of the actual satellite measurement ? of tropospheric no2 columns from the ozone monitoring instrument (omi). the retrieval system is based on the combined retrieval-assimilation-modelling approach developed at knmi for off-line tropospheric no2 from the gome and sciamachy satellite instruments. we have adapted the off-line system such that the required a priori information ndash; profile shapes and stratospheric background no2 ndash; is now immediately available upon arrival of the omi no2 slant columns and cloud data at knmi. slant column no2 and cloud information arrives at knmi typically within 80 min of actual omi observations. slant columns for no2 are retrieved using differential optical absorption spectroscopy (doas) in the 405?465 nm range. cloud fraction and cloud pressure are provided by a new cloud retrieval algorithm that uses the absorption of the o2?o2 collision complex near 477 nm. on-line availability of stratospheric slant columns and no2 profiles is achieved by running the tm4 chemistry transport model (ctm) forward in time based on forecast ecmwf meteo and assimilated no2 information from all previously observed orbits. omi no2 slant columns, after correction for spurious across-track variability, show a random error for individual pixels of approximately 0.7×1015molec.cm?2. as no2 retrievals are very sensitive to clouds, we evaluated the consistency of cloud fraction and cloud pressure from the new o2?o2 (omi) algorithm and from the fast retrieval scheme for cloud observables (fresco). cloud parameters from the o2?o2 (omi) algorithm have similar frequency distributions as cloud parameters retrieved from fresco (sciamachy) for august 2006. on average, omi cloud fractions are higher by 0.011, and omi cloud pressures exceed fresco cloud pressures by 60 hpa. as a consistency check, we intercompared omi near-real time no2 columns measured at 13:45 h local time to sciamachy off-line no2 columns measured at 10:00 h local time. in august 2006, both instruments observe very similar spatial patterns of tropospheric no2 columns, and small differences for most locations on earth where tropospheric no2 columns are small. for regions that are strongly polluted, sciamachy observes higher tropospheric no2 columns than omi.
enhanced block motion estimation based on threshold-aware two-path search method the three-step search algorithm has been widely used in block matching motion estimation due to its simplicity and effectiveness. the sparsely distributed checking points pattern in the first step is very suitable for searching large motion. however, for stationary or quasistationary blocks it will easily lead the search to be trapped into a local minimum. in this paper we propose a modification on the three-step search algorithm which employs a small diamond pattern in the first step, and the unrestricted search step is used to search the center area. experimental results show that the new efficient three-step search performs better than new three-step search in terms of mse and requires less computation by up to 15% on average.
assessing biodiversity integrity for the conservation of grazed and burnt grassland systems: avian field metabolic rates as a rapid assessment tool in this study, we investigated the responses of two faunal groups, birds and arthropods, to varying degrees of disturbance caused by fire and grazing in south africa, eight study sites of varying fire frequency and stocking density were studied over two summer seasons (october–march). bird assemblages reflected habitat disturbance in a diversity of ways, driven by factors ranging from direct disturbance to changes in habitat structure and functioning, and shifts in food availability. similarly, arthropod diversity and abundance changed seasonally in response to management practices. fire frequency drives faunal assemblage structure and abundance and, in most cases, overrides the effects of grazing at all taxonomic levels. in particular, fire frequency strongly influenced grassland-breeding birds because farms are burnt in the territory-forming stage of the breeding cycle. insectivores and nectarivores were disproportionately impacted by intensive commercial management. of particular concern in this system is the yellow-breasted pipit (anthus chloris), which is regionally and globally vulnerable because of habitat loss. this species is sensitive to any form of habitat disturbance, highlighting the need for conservation attention in these grasslands. of the ten arthropod orders present in the study area, only orthoptera responded positively to burning. however, orthopterans made up on average 78% of arthropod biomass in moist highland grasslands, resulting in high grasshopper biomass on annually burnt farms: this high biomass in turn supports an abundance of insectivores. this reinforces the importance of process-oriented data where a measure of performance, such as reproductive success, is considered in assessing ecosystem condition.
production of hydrogen, ethanol and volatile fatty acids through co-fermentation of macro- and micro-algae. fermentative hydrogen from seaweed is a potential biofuel of the future. mannitol, which is a typical carbohydrate component of seaweed, was used as a substrate for hydrogen fermentation. the theoretical specific hydrogen yield (shy) of mannitol was calculated as 5 mol h2/mol mannitol (615.4 ml h2/g mannitol) for acetic acid pathway, 3 mol h2/mol mannitol (369.2 ml h2/g mannitol) for butyric acid pathway and 1 mol h2/mol mannitol (123.1 ml h2/g mannitol) for lactic acid and ethanol pathways. an optimal shy of 1.82 mol h2/mol mannitol (224.2 ml h2/g mannitol) was obtained by heat pre-treated anaerobic digestion sludge under an initial ph of 8.0, nh4cl concentration of 25 mm, nacl concentration of 50mm and mannitol concentration of 10 g/l. the overall energy conversion efficiency achieved was 96.1%. the energy was contained in the end products, hydrogen (17.2%), butyric acid (38.3%) and ethanol (34.2%).
antagonizing deactivating cytokines to enhance host defense and chemotherapy in experimental visceral leishmaniasis in experimental leishmania donovani infection in balb/c mice, initial susceptibility gives way to t-cell-dependent acquired resistance and eventual control over visceral infection. since various cytokines appear to underlie the host response to leishmania infection, we examined infected liver tissue for gene expression of cytokines associated with th1 (gamma interferon [ifn-gamma] and interleukin-2 [il-2]) and th2 cells (il-4 and il-10). by northern (rna) blot analysis, only ifn-gamma mrna expression was detected in livers of infected euthymic mice. to determine whether activation of th1 cells develops selectively in this model, qualitative pcr analysis was used. these results indicated that mrnas for ifn-gamma, il-2, il-4, and il-10 were all induced by l. donovani infection. the potentially negative th2 cell-associated response did not appear to play a functional role, however, since resistance was acquired, anti-il-4 monoclonal antibody treatment did not accelerate control over visceral infection, and serum immunoglobulin e levels remained low. as judged by pcr analysis, il-4 and il-10 mrnas were also expressed under three other conditions without apparent effect: in naive euthymic mice treated with il-2, which induces leishmanicidal activity; in rechallenged immune mice, which resist reinfection; and in nude mice, which fail to control l. donovani. these results suggest that, like other leishmania species, l. donovani infection may trigger a potentially suppressive th2 cell-associated cytokine response. however, in t-cell-intact mice able to control l. donovani, this response either is insufficient to influence outcome or more likely is overshadowed by the th1 cell response.
topological relations between random areal objects within gis this paper presents a model for describing the positional error of line segments in geographical information systems (gis). the model is based on stochastic process theory with the assumptions that the errors of the endpoints of a line segment follow two-dimensional normal distributions. the distribution and density functions of the line segments are derived statistically. the uncertainty information matrix of line segments is derived to indicate the error of an arbitrary point on the line segment. this model covers the cases where two-end points are correlated to each other and points on the line segment are stochastically continuous to each other. the model is a more generic error band model than those previously developed and is called the g-band model.
clostridium difficile heterogeneously impacts intestinal community architecture but drives stable metabolome responses defining the functional status of host-associated microbial ecosystems has proven challenging owing to the vast number of predicted genes within the microbiome and relatively poor understanding of community dynamics and community–host interaction. metabolomic approaches, in which a large number of small molecule metabolites can be defined in a biological sample, offer a promising avenue to ‘fingerprint’ microbiota functional status. here, we examined the effects of the human gut microbiota on the fecal and urinary metabolome of a humanized (hum) mouse using an optimized ultra performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry-based method. differences between hum and conventional mouse urine and fecal metabolomic profiles support host-specific aspects of the microbiota’s metabolomic contribution, consistent with distinct microbial compositions. comparison of microbiota composition and metabolome of mice humanized with different human donors revealed that the vast majority of metabolomic features observed in donor samples are produced in the corresponding hum mice, and individual-specific features suggest ‘personalized’ aspects of functionality can be reconstituted in mice. feeding the mice a defined, custom diet resulted in modification of the metabolite signatures, illustrating that host diet provides an avenue for altering gut microbiota functionality, which in turn can be monitored via metabolomics. using a defined model microbiota consisting of one or two species, we show that simplified communities can drive major changes in the host metabolomic profile. our results demonstrate that metabolomics constitutes a powerful avenue for functional characterization of the intestinal microbiota and its interaction with the host.
retinal axonal loss begins early in the course of multiple sclerosis and is similar between progressive phenotypes clinically isolated syndromes (cis), such as optic neuritis, brainstem or spinal cord syndromes are frequently the first clinical presentations of multiple sclerosis. however, not all cis patients develop multiple sclerosis and in those who do, disability is highly variable. in previous follow-up studies, brain lesions on t2-weighted mri are associated with increased risk of multiple sclerosis and to an extent disability. we evaluated the longitudinal relationships between the mri lesions and clinical course over a period of 20 years. cis patients were recruited between 1984 and 1987 and previously followed up after 1, 5, 10 and 14 years. of the 140 subjects who were initially recruited with a cis for a baseline mri study, we followed up 107 patients after a mean of 20.2 years (range 18-27.7). multiple sclerosis was diagnosed as clinically definite on clinical grounds only and disability determined using the expanded disability status scale (edss) and multiple sclerosis functional composite (msfc) score. clinically definite multiple sclerosis developed in 67 out of 107 (63%) overall: 60 out of 73 (82%) with abnormal and 7 out of 34 (21%) with normal baseline mri. multiple sclerosis was still relapsing-remitting in 39 (58%)--including 26 (39%) with a 'benign' course (edss < or = 3)--whilst 28 (42%) had developed secondary progression. t2 lesion volume at all time-points correlated moderately with 20-year edss (r(s) values 0.48 to 0.67; p < 0.001) and msfc z-score [r(s) values (-0.50) to (-0.61); p < 0.001]. in those developing multiple sclerosis, a concurrent correlation of change in t2 lesion volume with change in edss was most evident in years 0-5 (r(s) = 0.69, p < 0.001). the estimated rate of lesion growth over 20 years was 0.80 cm3/year in those who retained a relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis course, and 2.89 cm3/year in those who developed secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, a difference of 2.09 cm3/year (95% ci: 0.77, 2.96; p < 0.001). this study extends previous follow-up of cis patients and sheds new light on how the lesions evolve according to the natural history. baseline mri findings are predictive for development of clinically definite multiple sclerosis. lesion volume and its change at earlier time points are correlated with disability after 20 years. lesion volume increases for at least 20 years in relapse-onset multiple sclerosis and the rate of lesion growth is three times higher in those who develop secondary progressive than in those who remain relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.
analysis of in vitro binding of dietary fibers by the phytoestrogen, daidzein, in the presence and absence of iron equol, a nonsteroidal estrogen of dietary origin, was recently identified in human urine, and is excreted in amounts comparable to the classical steroidal estrogens. we confirm here that phytoestrogens which are abundant in dietary soya protein are converted by human gastrointestinal flora to this weak estrogen. after the ingestion of meals containing cooked soya protein the urinary excretion of equol in four of six subjects studied increased by up to 1000-fold and this compound was the major phenolic compound found in the urine. these data also indicate that some subjects are unable to either produce or excrete equol despite the challenge of a diet containing soya. in view of the increasing use of commercial soya products in the diet and the capacity of human bacterial flora to synthesize this weak estrogen from the abundance of phytoestrogens in soya, the potential relevance of these observations to the diseases implicating steroid hormones is discussed.
new strategies for increasing heterozygosity in crops: vicia faba mating system as a study case estimates of single and multilocus outcrossing rates as well as relatedness among progeny of individual seed trees were obtained for 14 populations of pecan [carya illinoinensis (wangenh.) k. koch]. mean outcrossing estimates were not significantly different from 1.0 and relatedness values indicate that most progeny within families are half sibs. biparental inbreeding was insignificant in all study sites, and inbreeding coefficients indicated that populations were close to inbreeding equilibrium.
sexual dimorphism of sulcal length asymmetry in the cerebrum of adult cynomolgus monkeys (macaca fascicularis) the developmental origins of behavioural asymmetries, in particular handedness, have aroused considerable interest and debate. until now such behavioural asymmetries have only been reported after birth. here we report the existence of handedness before birth, expressed in terms of thumb-sucking by the fetus. ultrasound observations of fetuses from 15 weeks to term revealed a marked bias for sucking the thumb of the right hand. this preference appears to be maintained throughout pregnancy, is unrelated to fetal position in utero but correlates with head position preference in the supine newborn. the findings indicate that handedness is present prior to birth and the implications of this for the development of laterality are discussed.
the minimum m3-m4 loop length of neurotransmitter-activated pentameric receptors is critical for the structural integrity of cytoplasmic portals* 1 a human recombinant homo‐oligomeric 5‐ht3 receptor (h5‐ht3a) expressed in a human embryonic kidney cell line (hek 293) was characterized using the whole‐cell recording configuration of the patch clamp technique. 2 5‐ht evoked transient inward currents (ec50= 3.4 μm; hill coefficient = 1.8) that were blocked by the 5‐ht3 receptor antagonist ondansetron (ic50= 103 pm) and by the non‐selective agents metoclopramide (ic50= 69 nm), cocaine (ic50= 459 nm) and (+)‐tubocurarine (ic50= 2.8 μm). 3 5‐ht‐induced currents rectified inwardly and reversed in sign (e5‐ht) at a potential of −2.2 mv. n‐methyl‐d‐glucamine was finitely permeant. permeability ratios pna/pcs and pnmdg/pcs were 0.90 and 0.083, respectively. 4 permeability towards divalent cations was assessed from measurements of e5‐ht in media where ca2+ and mg2+ replaced na+. pca/pcs and pmg/pcs were calculated to be 1.00 and 0.61, respectively. 5 single channel chord conductance (γ) estimated from fluctuation analysis of macroscopic currents increased with membrane hyperpolarization from 243 fs at −40 mv to 742 fs at −100 mv. 6 reducing [ca2+]o from 2 to 0.1 mm caused an increase in the whole‐cell current evoked by 5‐ht. a concomitant reduction in [mg2+]o produced further potentiation. fluctuation analysis indicates that a voltage‐independent augmentation of γ contributes to this phenomenon. 7 the data indicate that homo‐oligomeric receptors composed of h5‐ht3a subunits form inwardly rectifying cation‐selective ion channels of low conductance that are permeable to ca2+ and mg2+.
proteomic analysis of peach fruit mesocarp softening and chilling injury using difference gel electrophoresis (dige) transgenic tobacco plants that synthesize alfalfa ferritin in vegetative tissues—either in its processed form in chloroplasts or in the cytoplasmic nonprocessed form—retained photosynthetic function upon free radical toxicity generated by iron excess or paraquat treatment. progeny of transgenic plants accumulating ferritin in their leaves exhibited tolerance to necrotic damage caused by viral (tobacco necrosis virus) and fungal (alternaria alternata, botrytis cinerea) infections. these transformants exhibited normal photosynthetic function and chlorophyll content under greenhouse conditions. we propose that by sequestering intracellular iron involved in generation of the very reactive hydroxyl radicals through a fenton reaction, ferritin protects plant cells from oxidative damage induced by a wide range of stresses.
transanal minimally invasive surgery for total mesorectal excision (tamis–tme): a stepwise description of the surgical technique with video demonstration background: single port access (spa) surgery is a new procedure for minimal invasive surgery using one multichannel port. the authors adapted this technique for transanal surgery as an improvement of the transanal endoscopic microsurgery (tem). methods: a total of 3 patients underwent spa modified tem using the sils port (covidien) under co2 insufflation. this port allows insertion of 2 laparoscopic instruments and a telescope. results: the operation was completed successfully in all cases. the transanal placement of the sils port was easy to perform; a prior dilatation of the anal sphincter was not necessary. there were no perioperative or postoperative complications as verified by postoperative observation, rectoscopy, and anal ultrasound. conclusions : transanal single port microsurgery is a feasible and new technique for less invasive and more gentle transanal surgery. by using this new multichannel device tem surgery was changed in a modified way while preserving the anal sphincter.
combinatorial gene regulatory functions underlie ultraconserved elements in drosophila robust innate behaviours are attractive systems for genetically dissecting how environmental cues are perceived and integrated to generate complex behaviours. during courtship, drosophila males engage in a series of innate, stereotyped behaviours that are coordinated by specific sensory cues. however, little is known about the specific neural substrates mediating this complex behavioural programme. genetic, developmental and behavioural studies have shown that the fruitless (fru) gene encodes a set of male-specific transcription factors (frum) that act to establish the potential for courtship in drosophila. frum proteins are expressed in ∼2% of central nervous system neurons, at least one subset of which coordinates the component behaviours of courtship. here we have inserted the yeast gal4 gene into the fru locus by homologous recombination and show that (1) frum is expressed in subsets of all peripheral sensory systems previously implicated in courtship, (2) inhibition of frum function in olfactory system components reduces olfactory-dependent changes in courtship behaviour, (3) transient inactivation of all frum-expressing neurons abolishes courtship behaviour, with no other gross changes in general behaviour, and (4) ‘masculinization’ of frum-expressing neurons in females is largely sufficient to confer male courtship behaviour. together, these data demonstrate that frum proteins specify the neural substrates of male courtship.
growth hormone response to growth hormone-releasing peptide-2 in growth hormone-deficient little mice publisher summary this chapter describes growth hormone (gh) as a polypeptide secreted by the somatotroph cells of the anterior pituitary gland, is the primary stimulator of linear growth in vertebrates and is involved in the regulation of protein and fat metabolism. gh also plays an important role in the control of immune function, gonadal steroidogenesis, and bone development. the actions of gh are mediated via the gh receptor, and major target tissues include the liver, muscle, and adipose tissue, where gh acts directly to stimulate cell proliferation and differentiation. the chapter discusses that the synthesis and secretion of gh from pituitary somatotroph cells is tightly regulated by several factors, including neurotransmitters such as gaba, npy, and the opiods; peptide hormones such as ghrelin and igf-1; and steroid hormones including thyroid hormone and the glucocorticoids. the hypothalamic neuropeptides growth hormone-releasing hormone (ghrh) and somatostatin (srif) are the predominant stimulatory and inhibitory neuroendocrine signals, respectively, for gh secretion by pituitary somatotroph cells. observations from both clinical studies and animal model systems confirm that ghrh is an important regulator of gh secretion and linear growth.
age-induced oxidative stress: how does it influence skeletal muscle quantity and quality? cumulative mtdna damage occurs in aging animals, and mtdna mutations are reported to accelerate aging in mice. we determined whether aging results in increased dna oxidative damage and reduced mtdna abundance and mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle of human subjects. studies performed in 146 healthy men and women aged 18-89 yr demonstrated that mtdna and mrna abundance and mitochondrial atp production all declined with advancing age. abundance of mtdna was positively related to mitochondrial atp production rate, which in turn, was closely associated with aerobic capacity and glucose tolerance. the content of several mitochondrial proteins was reduced in older muscles, whereas the level of the oxidative dna lesion, 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine, was increased, supporting the oxidative damage theory of aging. these results demonstrate that age-related muscle mitochondrial dysfunction is related to reduced mtdna and muscle functional changes that are common in the elderly.
reactive sc : speculatively relaxing memory consistency model contraints using dynamic classification of cache blocks sequential consistency (sc) is arguably the most intuitive behavior for a shared-memory multithreaded program. it is widely accepted that language-level sc could significantly improve programmability of a multiprocessor system. however, efficiently supporting end-to-end sc remains a challenge as it requires that both compiler and hardware optimizations preserve sc semantics. while a recent study has shown that a compiler can preserve sc semantics for a small performance cost, an efficient and complexity-effective sc hardware remains elusive. past hardware solutions relied on aggressive speculation techniques, which has not yet been realized in a practical implementation. this paper exploits the observation that hardware need not enforce any memory model constraints on accesses to thread-local and shared read-only locations. a processor can easily determine a large fraction of these safe accesses with assistance from static compiler analysis and the hardware memory management unit. we discuss a low-complexity hardware design that exploits this information to reduce the overhead in ensuring sc. our design employs an additional unordered store buffer for fast-tracking thread-local stores and allowing later memory accesses to proceed without a memory ordering related stall. our experimental study shows that the cost of guaranteeing end-to-end sc is only 6.2% on average when compared to a system with tso hardware executing a stock compiler's output.
multi-level multi-task structured sparse learning for diagnosis of schizophrenia disease in multi-task learning (mtl), multiple related tasks are learned jointly by sharing information across them. many mtl algorithms have been proposed to learn the underlying task groups. however, those methods are limited to learn the task groups at only a single level, which may be not sufficient to model the complex structure among tasks in many real-world applications. in this paper, we propose a multi-level task grouping (metag) method to learn the multi-level grouping structure instead of only one level among tasks. specifically, by assuming the number of levels to be h, we decompose the parameter matrix into a sum of h component matrices, each of which is regularized with a l2 norm on the pairwise difference among parameters of all the tasks to construct level-specific task groups. for optimization, we employ the smoothing proximal gradient method to efficiently solve the objective function of the metag model. moreover, we provide theoretical analysis to show that under certain conditions the metag model can recover the true parameter matrix and the true task groups in each level with high probability. we experiment our approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing competitive performance over state-of-the-art mtl methods.
oxygen consumption and usage during physical exercise: the balance between oxidative stress and ros-dependent adaptive signaling. objective the responses to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps) damage mitochondria by generating oxidative stress within the organelles. we postulated that lps damages heart mitochondrial dna and protein by oxidation, and that this is recovered by oxidative mechanisms of mitochondrial biogenesis.   methods and results systemic crude e. coli lps administration decreased mtdna copy number and mtdna gene transcription in rat heart caused by oxidant deletion of mtdna. the fall in copy number was reflected in proteomic expression of several mitochondria-encoded subunits of complexes i, iv, and v. recovery of mtdna copy number involved biogenesis as indicated by mitochondrial transcription factor a (tfam) and dna polymerase-gamma expression. the transcriptional response also included nuclear accumulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma co-activator 1 (pgc-1) and mrna expression for redox-regulated nuclear respiratory factors (nrf-1 and -2).   conclusions these novel findings disclose a duality of reactive oxygen species (ros) effect in the heart's response to lps in which oxidative mitochondrial damage is opposed by oxidant stimulation of biogenesis.
phylogeography, historical demography, and genetic structure of the rose bitterling, rhodeus ocellatus (kner, 1866) (cypriniformes: acheilognathidae), in east asia. [1] a new regional compilation of the drainage history in southeastern tibet suggests that the modern rivers draining the plateau margin were once tributaries to a single, southward flowing system which drained into the south china sea. disruption of the paleo-drainage occurred by river capture and reversal prior to or coeval with the initiation of miocene (?) uplift in eastern tibet, including ∼2000 m of surface uplift of the lower plateau margin since reversal of the flow direction of the yangtze river. despite lateral changes in course due to capture and reversal, the superposition of eastward and southward draining rivers that cross the southeastern plateau margin suggests that uplift has occurred over long wavelengths (>1000 km), mimicking the present low-gradient topographic slope. thus reorganization of drainage lines by capture and reversal events explains most of the peculiar patterns of the eastern plateau rivers, without having to appeal to large-magnitude tectonic shear.
physical water compartments: a revised concept of perinatal body water physiology. the present study was performed to investigate simultaneously total lung water, t1 and t2 relaxation times, and hyaluronan (ha) in preterm and term rabbits. attempts were also made to establish the relationship of ha to total lung water and to t2-derived motionally distinct water fractions. experiments were performed in fetal pannon white rabbit pups at gestational ages of 25, 27, 29, and 31 d and at a postnatal age of 4 d. lung tissue water content (desiccation method), t1 and t2 relaxation times (h1-nmr method), and ha concentration (radioassay) were measured, and free and bound water fractions were calculated by using multicomponent fits of the t2 relaxation curves. lung water content and t1 and t2 relaxation times were highest at a gestational age of 27 d and then declined steadily during the whole study period. similar trends and time courses were seen for the fast and slow components of the t2 relaxation curve. the t2-derived free water fraction remained unchanged at a gestational age of 25–29 d (∼67%), but increased progressively to a value of 78.5 ± 7.9% at 31 d (p < 0.001) and to 83.4 ± 9.4% at the postnatal age of 4 d (p < 0.01). opposite changes occurred in the bound water fraction. lung ha concentration decreased with advancing gestation from 870.8 ± 205.2 μg/g dry weight at 25 d to 162.6 ± 32.4 μg/g dry weight at 31 d (p < 0.001), but it was increased 2-fold postnatally. ha correlated positively with total lung water (r = 0.39;p < 0.001) but not with the bound water fraction. it is suggested that the physiologic lung dehydration is associated with macromolecule-related reorganization of lung water and that the role of ha in this process needs to be further investigated.
real-time visual tracking based on an appearance model and a motion mode recently, on-line adaptation of binary classifiers for tracking have been investigated. on-line learning allows for simple classifiers since only the current view of the object from its surrounding background needs to be discriminiated. however, on-line adaption faces one key problem: each update of the tracker may introduce an error which, finally, can lead to tracking failure (drifting). the contribution of this paper is a novel on-line semi-supervised boosting method which significantly alleviates the drifting problem in tracking applications. this allows to limit the drifting problem while still staying adaptive to appearance changes. the main idea is to formulate the update process in a semi-supervised fashion as combined decision of a given prior and an on-line classifier. this comes without any parameter tuning. in the experiments, we demonstrate real-time tracking of our semiboost tracker on several challenging test sequences where our tracker outperforms other on-line tracking methods.
precise and efficient nucleotide substitution near genomic nick via noncanonical homology-directed repair. targeted genome editing technologies have enabled a broad range of research and medical applications. the cas9 nuclease from the microbial crispr-cas system is targeted to specific genomic loci by a 20 nt guide sequence, which can tolerate certain mismatches to the dna target and thereby promote undesired off-target mutagenesis. here, we describe an approach that combines a cas9 nickase mutant with paired guide rnas to introduce targeted double-strand breaks. because individual nicks in the genome are repaired with high fidelity, simultaneous nicking via appropriately offset guide rnas is required for double-stranded breaks and extends the number of specifically recognized bases for target cleavage. we demonstrate that using paired nicking can reduce off-target activity by 50- to 1,500-fold in cell lines and to facilitate gene knockout in mouse zygotes without sacrificing on-target cleavage efficiency. this versatile strategy enables a wide variety of genome editing applications that require high specificity.
self-care strategies for emotional distress among young adults in catalonia: a qualitative study despite the high prevalence of mental health problems and disorders that develop in adolescence and early adulthood, young people tend to not seek professional help. young men and young people from indigenous and ethnic minority groups tend to be those most reluctant to seek help. young people are more inclined to seek help for mental health problems if they: have some knowledge about mental health issues and sources of help; feel emotionally competent to express their feelings; and have established and trusted relationships with potential help providers. young people are less likely to seek help if they: are experiencing suicidal thoughts and depressive symptoms; hold negative attitudes toward seeking help or have had negative past experiences with sources of help; or hold beliefs that they should be able to sort out their own mental health problems on their own. young people may seek help through talking to their family and friends, with family being more important for younger adolescents, and friends and partners becoming more influential later on. the professionals most likely to act as gatekeepers to mental health services for young people are school counsellors, general practitioners, and youth workers. increasingly, internet‐based information and interventions are being used to engage young people in the help‐seeking process.
a novel feeder-free system for human embryonic stem cells and characterization of their sublines with autogenic and allogenic cultivation human pluripotent stem cells hold promising potential in many therapeutics applications including regenerative medicine and drug discovery. over the past three decades, embryonic stem cell research has illustrated that embryonic stem cells possess two important and distinct properties: the ability to continuously self-renew and the ability to differentiate into all specialized cell types. in this article, we will discuss the continuing evolution of human pluripotent stem cell culture by examining requirements needed for the maintenance of self-renewal in vitro. we will also elaborate on the future direction of the field toward generating a robust and completely defined culture system, which has brought forth collaborations amongst biologists and engineers. as human pluripotent stem cell research progresses towards identifying solutions for debilitating diseases, it will be critical to establish a defined, reproducible and scalable culture system to meet the requirements of these clinical applications.
outcome of microdissection tese compared with conventional tese in non‐obstructive azoospermia: a systematic review in a population of non-obstructive azoospermia patients, the efficacy of microsurgical testicular sperm extraction (microtese) and conventional tese was evaluated in a randomized controlled study on 138 testicles, classified and paired in a 48-square table according to the different classes of the following three variables: patient plasma fsh concentration, orchidometry and testicular histology. sperm retrieval was positive in 21/22 testicles with hypospermatogenesis (11/11, 10/11; microtese, tese respectively), in 12/14 with maturation arrest (6/7, 6/7), in 16/22 with incomplete sertoli cell-only syndrome (8/11, 8/11), and in 16/80 with complete sertoli cell-only syndrome (11/40, 5/40). sperm recovery was positive in 5/24 patients with fsh concentration > or = 3 x maximum value of normal range (n) (4/12, 1/12), in 17/40 patients with 2n < or = fsh < 3n (9/20, 8/20), in 30/48 patients with n < fsh < 2n (17/24, 13/24), and in 13/26 patients with fsh = n (6/13, 7/13). regarding orchidometry, sperm recovery was positive in 11/18 testicles with volume (v) > or = 12 ml (6/9, 5/9), in 27/56 testicles with 8 ml < or = v < 12 ml (15/28, 12/28), and in 27/64 testicles with v < 8 ml (15/32, 12/32). fsh value and the surgical procedure were the two variables significantly (p < 0.05) predicting positive sperm retrieval.
prediction of ovarian cancer prognosis and response to chemotherapy by a serum-based multiparametric biomarker panel epithelial ovarian cancer constitutes one-quarter of the gynecologic malignancies, but is the leading cause of death among women with gynecologic cancer. in 6070% of the women, the disease is detected at a late stage when 5-year survival is poor. the recommended primary therapeutic approach for ovarian cancer is aggressive primarydebulking surgery followed by combination chemotherapy. the efficacy is routinely evaluated by repeated vaginal examination and transabdominal ultrasonography. however, these methods are unreliable for monitoring as progressive and recurrent disease often remains hidden until the patient presents with a large tumor mass. over the last few decades a variety of serological tumor markers has been proposed as a supplement to other non-invasive diagnostic methods. the main issue with tumor marker measurements is to obtain reliable information about changes in tumor mass before the changes are detectable by other methods. however, despite several attempts to identify useful serological markers for epithelial ovarian cancer, the results have not been as encouraging as for germ-cell tumors. the purpose of this paper is to review the applicability of ca 125, cea, tpa, tati, casa, and tetranectin in screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of ovarian carcinoma. several compounds other than those mentioned above are being investigated as markers in the early detection and management of ovarian cancer. some ofthese potential tumor markers listed in table 1 will not be discussed further in this review.
assessing biodiversity integrity for the conservation of grazed and burnt grassland systems: avian field metabolic rates as a rapid assessment tool in this study, we investigated the responses of two faunal groups, birds and arthropods, to varying degrees of disturbance caused by fire and grazing in south africa, eight study sites of varying fire frequency and stocking density were studied over two summer seasons (october–march). bird assemblages reflected habitat disturbance in a diversity of ways, driven by factors ranging from direct disturbance to changes in habitat structure and functioning, and shifts in food availability. similarly, arthropod diversity and abundance changed seasonally in response to management practices. fire frequency drives faunal assemblage structure and abundance and, in most cases, overrides the effects of grazing at all taxonomic levels. in particular, fire frequency strongly influenced grassland-breeding birds because farms are burnt in the territory-forming stage of the breeding cycle. insectivores and nectarivores were disproportionately impacted by intensive commercial management. of particular concern in this system is the yellow-breasted pipit (anthus chloris), which is regionally and globally vulnerable because of habitat loss. this species is sensitive to any form of habitat disturbance, highlighting the need for conservation attention in these grasslands. of the ten arthropod orders present in the study area, only orthoptera responded positively to burning. however, orthopterans made up on average 78% of arthropod biomass in moist highland grasslands, resulting in high grasshopper biomass on annually burnt farms: this high biomass in turn supports an abundance of insectivores. this reinforces the importance of process-oriented data where a measure of performance, such as reproductive success, is considered in assessing ecosystem condition.
tensor decomposition reveals concurrent evolutionary convergences and divergences and correlations with structural motifs in ribosomal rna principal component analysis (pca) can be seen as a singular value decomposition (svd) of a column-centred data matrix. in a number of applications, no pre-processing of the data is carried out, and it is the uncentred data matrix that is subjected to an svd, in what is often called an uncentred pca. this paper explores the relationships between the results from both the standard, column-centred, pca, and its uncentred counterpart. in particular, it obtains both exact results and bounds relating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariation matrices, as well as the principal components, in both types of analysis. these relationships highlight how the eigenvalues of both the covariance matrix and the matrix of non-central second moments contain much information that is highly informative for a comparative assessment of pca and its uncentred variant. the relations and the examples also suggest that the results of both types of pca have more in common than might be supposed.

changes in flexion-relaxation phenomenon and lumbo-pelvic kinematics following lumbar disc replacement surgery objectivesthe purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between pain-related fear, lumbar flexion, and dynamic emg activity among persons with chronic musculoskeletal low back pain. it was hypothesized that pain-related fear would be significantly related to decreased lumbar flexion and specific patterns of emg activity during flexion and extension. study designdata was obtained from subjects who, on a single day, completed self-report measures of pain and pain-related fear, and were interviewed to determine demographic and pain information. subjects then underwent a dynamic emg evaluation for which they were asked to stand, then bend forward as far as possible, stay fully flexed, and return to standing. lumbar emg and angle of flexion were recorded during this time. a flexion-relaxation ratio (frr) was computed by comparing maximal emg while flexing to the average emg in full flexion. subjectsseventy-six persons with chronic musculoskeletal low back pain. resultszero-order correlations indicated that pain-related fear was significantly related to reduced lumber flexion (r = −0.55), maximum emg during flexion (r = −0.38) and extension (r = −0.51), and the frr (r = −0.40). when controlling for pain and demographic factors, pain-related fear continued to be related to reduced lumbar flexion. using a path-analytic model to examine whether angle of flexion mediated the relationship between fear and emg activity, the models examining maximal emg during flexion and extension supported the notion that pain-related fear influences these measures indirectly through its association with decreased range of motion. conversely, pain-related fear was independently related to higher average emg in full flexion, while angle of flexion was not significantly related. pain-related fear was directly related to a smaller frr, as well as indirectly through angle of flexion. conclusionspain-related fear is significantly associated with reduced lumbar flexion, greater emg in full flexion, and a smaller frr. the relationship between pain-related fear and emg during flexion and extension appears to be mediated by reduced lumbar flexion. these results suggest that pain-related fear is directly associated with musculoskeletal abnormalities observed among persons with chronic low back pain, as well as indirectly through limited lumbar flexion. these musculoskeletal abnormalities as well as limited movement may be involved in the development and maintenance of chronic low back pain. in addition, changes in musculoskeletal functioning and flexion associated with pain-related fear may warrant greater attention as part of treatment.
klein tunneling near the dirac points in metal-dielectric multilayer metamaterials this study is to improve understanding of nonlinear optics through investigating the microstructures of carbon disulfide (cs(2)) liquid, an important nonlinear optical material. first principles methods are employed in this work to investigate the structure, vibrational spectra, and the 2nd hyperpolarizabilites of cs(2) clusters up to tetramers. three types of molecular arrangements of clusters with different sizes are identified. the cluster conformations are prone to inter-converting under external disturbance due to the weak interactions among molecules. the correlation between the nonlinear optical properties and the conformation of cs(2) clusters are studied in detail in this work.
expanded, but not regulated: ambiguity in home-care policy in ireland. this article describes and evaluates cash-for-care programmes for older people in four european countries, namely home-care grants in ireland, direct payments in the united kingdom (england), service vouchers in finland and personal budgets in the netherlands. the purpose is to raise understanding of the background and reasons for the introduction of cash-for-care programmes and their impact on the countries' care regimes. it is argued that while the motives for introducing cash-for-care programmes in the four countries are similar, namely to promote choice and autonomy, to plug gaps in existing provision, to create jobs, and to promote efficiency, cost savings and domiciliary care, the relative importance of these goals varies. current cash-for-care programmes have comparatively modest coverage as compared with direct service provision and provide no more than an optional, supplementary source of care in three of the studied countries. cash-for-care schemes have not radically transformed the care regimes in finland, the netherlands or the united kingdom. in ireland, however, the restricted availability of alternative forms of formal service provision means that the expansion of cash-for-care might shift care provision significantly towards private provision and financing.
dependency of phenprocoumon dosage on polymorphisms in the vkorc1 and cyp2c9 genes cyp2c9 catalyses the biotransformation of the oral anticoagulants s-warfarin and r- and s-acenocoumarol. according to data obtained in vitro, phenprocoumon is also metabolized by cyp2c9 but the impact of the cyp2c9 polymorphism on phenprocoumon pharmacokinetics has not been studied. twenty-six healthy heterozygous and homozygous carriers of the cyp2c9 alleles *1 (wild-type), *2 (arg144cys), and *3 (ile359leu) received a single oral dose of 12 mg of racemic phenprocoumon. plasma and 12 h urine concentrations of both enantiomers and their monohydroxylated metabolites were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry detection. no significant effect of the cyp2c9 variants *2 and *3 on r-phenprocoumon pharmacokinetic parameters was detected, but s-phenprocoumon clearance tended to decrease with increasing number of cyp2c9*2 and *3 alleles. the ratios of s- to r-phenprocoumon plasma clearances were higher with a median of 0.95 in carriers of *1/*1 versus 0.65 in *3/*3 (p < 0.001 for trend). plasma and urine concentrations of 4'-, 6- and 7-hydroxyphenprocoumon were significantly lower in homozygous carriers of the cyp2c9*2 and *3 variants compared to cyp2c9*1/*1. carriers of cyp2c9*3/*3 had a median auc of (r,s) 7-oh-phenprocoumon of only approximately 25% compared to the wild-type genotype. the auc of (r,s) 6-oh-phenprocoumon was only approximately 50% in cyp2c9*3/*3 compared to the homozygous wild-type genotype. in conclusion, carriers of cyp2c9*2 and *3 alleles had a lower metabolic capacity regarding phenprocoumon hydroxylation than those with cyp2c9*1/*1. however, regarding phenprocoumon hydroxylation cyp2c9 genotypes had only marginal effects on s- and r-phenprocoumon total clearance in healthy volunteers.
infection avoidance behavior: viral exposure reduces the motivation to forage in female drosophila melanogaster interactions between immune systems, nervous systems, and behavior are well established in vertebrates. a comparative examination of these interactions in other animals will help us understand their evolution and present adaptive functions. insects show immune-behavioral interactions similar to those seen in vertebrates, suggesting that many of them may have a highly conserved function. activation of an immune response in insects results in illness-induced anorexia, behavioral fever, changes in reproductive behavior, and decreased learning ability in a broad range of species. flight-or-fight behaviors result in a decline in disease resistance. in insects, illness-induced anorexia may enhance immunity. stress-induced immunosuppression is probably due to physiological conflicts between the immune response and those of other physiological processes. because insects occupy a wide range of ecological niches, they will be useful in examining how some immune-behavioral interactions are sculpted by an animal's behavioral ecology.
exposure assessment approach through mycotoxin/creatinine ratio evaluation in urine by gc-ms/ms. a new analytical method for the rapid and simultaneous determination of ten mycotoxins including patulin, zearalenone and eight trichothecenes (nivalenol, fusarenon-x, diacetoxyscirpenol, 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol, neosolaniol, deoxynivalenol, t-2 and ht-2) in wheat semolina has been developed and optimized. sample extraction and purification were performed with a modified quechers-based (acronym of quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe) procedure and determined by gas chromatography (gc) coupled to triple quadrupole instrument (qqq). this is the first paper on the application of gc-qqq-ms/ms to analysis of mycotoxins. careful optimization of the gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry parameters was achieved in order to attain a fast separation with the best sensitivity allowing a total run time of 16 min. the validation was performed by analyzing recovery samples at three different spiked concentrations, 20, 40 and 80 μg kg(-1), with four replicates (n=4) at each concentration. recoveries ranged from 74% to 124% and the intra-day precision and inter-day precision, expressed as relative standard deviation, were lower than 13% and 17%, respectively for all studied compounds, except for zearalenone. limits of quantification (loq) were lower than 10 μg kg(-1) for all studied mycotoxins. eight concentration levels were used for constructing the calibration curves which showed good linearity between loq and 100 times loq concentration levels (linear range). matrix-matched calibration for applying the method in routine analysis is recommended for reliable quantitative results. the method validated was successfully applied to fifteen wheat semolina samples detecting occurrence of mycotoxins at concentrations below the maximum permissible level.
can coffee consumption lower the risk of alzheimer’s disease and parkinson’s disease? a literature review background/objectives:numbers of epidemiological studies assessing coffee consumption and serum lipids have yielded inconsistent results. we aimed to evaluate the effects of coffee intake on serum lipids.subjects/methods:we searched several english and chinese electronic databases up to september 2011 for randomized controlled trials of coffee on serum lipids. weighted mean effect size was calculated for net changes in serum lipids by using random-effect models or fixed-effect models. subgroup and meta-regression analyses were conducted to explore possible explanations for heterogeneity among trials.results:twelve studies conducted in western countries with a total of 1017 subjects were identified. meta-analyses showed, on average, drinking coffee for 45 days was associated with an increase of 8.1 mg/dl (95% confidence interval (ci): 4.5, 11.6; p<0.001) for total cholesterol (tc), 5.4 mg/dl (95% ci: 1.4, 9.5; p=0.009) for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c) and 12.6 mg/dl (95% ci: 3.5, 12.6; p=0.007) for triglyceride (tg). the increase in tc were greater in trials using unfiltered coffee and caffeinated coffee as the treatment group. those who had hyperlipidemia were more sensitive to the cholesterol-raising effect of coffee. meta-regression analysis revealed a positive dose-response relation between coffee intake and tc, ldl-c and tg.conclusion:the intake of coffee especially unfiltered coffee is contributed significantly to the increase in tc, ldl-c and tg, and the changes were related to the level of intake. studies of coffee intake on serum lipids in asian populations should be performed.
prevalence and severity of ocular surface neoplasia in african nations and need for early interventions objective to examine the reliability of clinical examination and in vivo confocal microscopy (ivcm) in distinguishing ocular surface squamous neoplasia (ossn) from benign conjunctival lesions. design case-control study. participants sixty individuals with conjunctival lesions (ossn and benign) and 60 age-matched controls with normal conjunctiva presenting to kilimanjaro christian medical centre, moshi, tanzania. methods participants were examined and photographed, and ivcm was performed. patients with conjunctival lesions were offered excisional biopsy with histopathology and a human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) test. the ivcm images were read masked to the clinical appearance and pathology results. images were graded for several specific features and given an overall categorization (normal, benign, or malignant). a group of 8 ophthalmologists were shown photographs of conjunctival lesions and asked to independently classify as ossn or benign. main outcome measures comparison of the histopathology diagnosis with the clinical and ivcm diagnosis. results fifty-two cases underwent excisional biopsy with histopathology; 34 were on the ossn spectrum, 17 were benign, and 1 was lymphoma. the cases and controls had comparable demographic profiles. human immunodeficiency syndrome infection was more common in ossn compared with benign cases (58.8% vs. 5.6%; odds ratio, 24.3, 95% confidence interval [ci], 2.8–204; p = 0.003). clinically, ossn lesions more frequently exhibited feeder vessels and tended to have more leukoplakia and a gelatinous appearance. overall, the ophthalmologists showed moderate agreement with the histology result (average kappa = 0.51; 95% ci, 0.36–0.64). the masked grading of ivcm images reliably distinguished normal conjunctiva. however, ivcm was unable to reliably distinguish between benign lesions and ossn because of an overlap in their appearance (kappa = 0.44; 95% ci, 0.32–0.57). no single feature was significantly more frequent in ossn compared with benign lesions. the sensitivity and specificity of ivcm for distinguishing ossn from benign conjunctival lesions were 38.5% and 66.7%, respectively. conclusions in east africa, conjunctival pathology is relatively common and can present significant diagnostic challenges for the clinician. in this study, neither clinical examination nor ivcm was found to reliably distinguish ossn from benign conjunctival pathology because of an overlap in the features of these groups. therefore, ivcm cannot currently replace histopathology, and management decisions should continue to rely on careful clinical assessment supported by histopathology as indicated.
gambit: a parameterless model-based evolutionary algorithm for mixed-integer problems evolution strategies (ess) are powerful probabilistic search and optimization algorithms gleaned from biological evolution theory. they have been successfully applied to a wide range of real world applications. the modern ess are mainly designed for solving continuous parameter optimization problems. their ability to adapt the parameters of the multivariate normal distribution used for mutation during the optimization run makes them well suited for this domain. in this article we describe and study mixed integer evolution strategies (mies), which are natural extensions of es for mixed integer optimization problems. mies can deal with parameter vectors consisting not only of continuous variables but also with nominal discrete and integer variables. following the design principles of the canonical evolution strategies, they use specialized mutation operators tailored for the aforementioned mixed parameter classes. for each type of variable, the choice of mutation operators is governed by a natural metric for this variable type, maximal entropy, and symmetry considerations. all distributions used for mutation can be controlled in their shape by means of scaling parameters, allowing self-adaptation to be implemented. after introducing and motivating the conceptual design of the mies, we study the optimality of the self-adaptation of step sizes and mutation rates on a generalized (weighted) sphere model. moreover, we prove global convergence of the mies on a very general class of problems. the remainder of the article is devoted to performance studies on artificial landscapes (barrier functions and mixed integer nk landscapes), and a case study in the optimization of medical image analysis systems. in addition, we show that with proper constraint handling techniques, mies can also be applied to classical mixed integer nonlinear programming problems.
a comparison of 10 accelerometer non-wear time criteria and logbooks in children objective to examine the effects of accelerometer epoch lengths, wear time (wt) algorithms, and activity cut-points on estimates of wt, sedentary behavior (sb), and physical activity (pa). methods 268 7–11 year-olds with bmi ≥ 85th percentile for age and sex wore accelerometers on their right hips for 4–7 days. data were processed and analyzed at epoch lengths of 1-, 5-, 10-, 15-, 30-, and 60-seconds. for each epoch length, wt minutes/day was determined using three common wt algorithms, and minutes/day and percent time spent in sb, light (lpa), moderate (mpa), and vigorous (vpa) pa were determined using five common activity cut-points. anova tested differences in wt, sb, lpa, mpa, vpa, and mvpa when using the different epoch lengths, wt algorithms, and activity cut-points. results wt minutes/day varied significantly by epoch length when using the nhanes wt algorithm (p < .0001), but did not vary significantly by epoch length when using the ≥ 20 minute consecutive zero or choi wt algorithms. minutes/day and percent time spent in sb, lpa, mpa, vpa, and mvpa varied significantly by epoch length for all sets of activity cut-points tested with all three wt algorithms (all p < .0001). across all epoch lengths, minutes/day and percent time spent in sb, lpa, mpa, vpa, and mvpa also varied significantly across all sets of activity cut-points with all three wt algorithms (all p < .0001). conclusions the common practice of converting wt algorithms and activity cut-point definitions to match different epoch lengths may introduce significant errors. estimates of sb and pa from studies that process and analyze data using different epoch lengths, wt algorithms, and/or activity cut-points are not comparable, potentially leading to very different results, interpretations, and conclusions, misleading research and public policy.
role of hippocampal ca1 atrophy in memory encoding deficits in amnestic mild cognitive impairment a meta‐analysis of experimentally induced changes in blood flow (“activations”) in positron emission tomography (pet) studies of memory has revealed an orderly functional anatomic pattern: activations in the hippocampal region associated with episodic memory encoding are located primarily in the rostral portions of the region, whereas activations associated with episodic memory retrieval are located primarily in the caudal portions. these findings are based on an analysis of a sample of 54 “hippocampal encoding and retrieval” activations that were culled from an overall database consisting of 52 published pet studies of memory. we refer to this general pattern of rostrocaudal gradient of encoding and retrieval pet activations as the hiper (hippocampal encoding/retrieval) model. the model suggests a division of memory‐related labor between the rostral and caudal portions of the hippocampal formation. because functional anatomic pattern of encoding and retrieval activation that defines the hiper model was unprecedented and unexpected, it is difficult to relate the model to what is already known or thought about functional neuroanatomy of episodic memory in the hippocampal regions. the model is interesting primarily because its exploration may yield fresh insights into the neural basis of human memory. hippocampus 1998;8:313–322. © 1998 wiley‐liss, inc.
in vivo rna interference screens identify regulators of antiviral cd4(+) and cd8(+) t cell differentiation. t follicular helper cell differentiation when b cells respond to an infection, they often require help from cd4+ t cells to mount a proper response. it is thought that a subset of cd4+ effector t cells, called t follicular helper cells (tfh), performs this function. several subsets of effector cd4+ t cells arise, depending on the type of infection, which have distinct transcriptional programs driving their differentiation. whether this is also the case for tfh cells has not been clear (see the perspective by awasthi and kuchroo). nurieva et al. (p. 1001, published online 23 july) and johnston et al. (p. 1006; published online 16 july) now demonstrate that the transcription factor bcl6 is both necessary and sufficient for tfh differentiation and subsequent b cell–mediated immunity, suggesting that it is a master regulator of this lineage. johnston et al. also show that expression of bcl6 and the transcription factor, blimp-1, are reciprocally regulated in tfh cells and that, when ectopically expressed, blimp-1 inhibits tfh development. the transcription factors that regulate follicular t helper cell differentiation are identified. effective b cell–mediated immunity and antibody responses often require help from cd4+ t cells. it is thought that a distinct cd4+ effector t cell subset, called t follicular helper cells (tfh), provides this help; however, the molecular requirements for tfh differentiation are unknown. we found that expression of the transcription factor bcl6 in cd4+ t cells is both necessary and sufficient for in vivo tfh differentiation and t cell help to b cells in mice. in contrast, the transcription factor blimp-1, an antagonist of bcl6, inhibits tfh differentiation and help, thereby preventing b cell germinal center and antibody responses. these findings demonstrate that tfh cells are required for proper b cell responses in vivo and that bcl6 and blimp-1 play central but opposing roles in tfh differentiation.
msea: modified symmetric encryption algorithm a new secret-key block cipher is proposed as a candidate for a new encryption standard. in the proposed cipher, the plaintext and the ciphertext are 64 bit blocks, while the secret key is 128 bit long. the cipher is based on the design concept of "mixing operations from different algebraic groups". the cipher structure was chosen to provide confusion and diffusion and to facilitate both hardware and software implementations.

ftir spectroscopic study of molecular organization of the antibiotic amphotericin b in aqueous solution and in dppc lipid monolayers containing the sterols cholesterol and ergosterol monolayers of amphotericin b (amb) and monolayers composed of amb and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (dppc) were formed at the argon–water interface and deposited on a solid support by means of the langmuir–blodgett technique. the hypsochromic shift observed in the absorption spectra of monolayers is indicative of aggregated structures of amb. the exciton splitting theory allowed us to calculate the distance between neighboring molecules in the aggregates as 7.8 å. scanning force microscopy of the amb monolayers revealed the formation of a homogeneous monolayer composed of molecules separated by a distance of 6–8 å. microscopy also reveals the formation of cylindrical structures of amb with a diameter close to 17 å (internal diameter close to 6 å) in the monolayers containing additionally 10 mol% dppc.
referential choices in a collaborative storytelling task: discourse stages and referential complexity matter in this study, children, young adults and elderly adults were tested in production and comprehension tasks assessing referential choice. our aims were (1) to determine whether speakers egocentrically base their referential choice on the preceding linguistic discourse or also take into account the perspective of a hypothetical listener and (2) whether the possible impact of perspective taking on referential choice changes with increasing age, with its associated changes in cognitive capacity. in the production task, participants described picture-based stories featuring two characters of the same gender, making it necessary to use unambiguous forms; in the comprehension task, participants interpreted potentially ambiguous pronouns at the end of similar orally presented stories. young adults (aged 18–35) were highly sensitive to the informational needs of hypothetical conversational partners in their production and comprehension of referring expressions. in contrast, children (aged 4–7) did not take into account possible conversational partners and tended to use pronouns for all given referents, leading to the production of ambiguous pronouns that are unrecoverable for a listener. this was mirrored in the outcome of the comprehension task, where children were insensitive to the shift of discourse topic marked by the speaker. the elderly adults (aged 69–87) behaved differently from both young adults and children. they showed a clear sensitivity to the other person's perspective in both production and comprehension, but appeared to lack the necessary cognitive capacities to keep track of the prominence of discourse referents, producing more potentially ambiguous pronouns than young adults, though fewer than children. in conclusion then, referential choice seems to depend on perspective taking in language, which develops with increasing linguistic experience and cognitive capacity, but also on the ability to keep track of the prominence of discourse referents, which is gradually lost with older age.
a line-1 element insertion in the 5′-noncoding region of caprine growth hormone receptor gene a polymorphic tg-repeat microsatellite is located 90 base pairs upstream from a major transcription start site in the bovine growth hormone receptor gene. a shorter allele with 11 consecutive tg is common in bos indicus cattle, whereas longer 16- to 20-tg-repeat alleles predominate in bos taurus breeds. the purpose of this study was to compare growth and carcass traits between angus steers that had two of the longer growth hormone receptor alleles with their half-siblings that had one short allele and one of the longer alleles. we genotyped 64 angus sires with respect to the poly-tg microsatellite and identified six bulls that were heterozygous in that they had one short 11-tg allele and one of the longer alleles. we then grouped 125 steer progeny of these six heterozygous bulls according to their genotypes: only the longer 16- to 20-tg-repeat alleles were found in 73 steer progeny (long/long homozygotes), whereas a short 11-tg allele was paired with one of the longer alleles in 52 progeny (short/long heterozygotes). contrasts for the long/long homozygotes vs the short/long heterozygotes were significant for weaning weight (17 +/- 4 kg; p < .001) and carcass weight (14 +/- 5 kg; p < .01). approaching significance (p = .03) was the contrast for usda marbling score (-.3 +/- .2). no significant differences (p > .05) were detected for contrasts in birth weight (.3 +/- .6 kg), longissimus muscle area (-.2 +/- 1 cm2), or carcass fat depth (-.01 +/- .07 cm). this polymorphism has potential for use in dna marker-assisted selection programs.
women-specific hiv/aids services: identifying and defining the components of holistic service delivery for women living with hiv/aids specialized substance abuse treatment programs have been developed for women within the past two decades. this article presents the results of a secondary analysis of a regional database of drug abuse treatment programs that compared the characteristics of women-only (wo) and mixed-gender (mg) programs across three treatment modalities. in general, wo programs differed from mg programs in their policies regarding fees, sources of payment, special populations served, services offered, and treatment capacity, process, and duration. the differences in program characteristics reflect broader societal gender differences, including women's generally lower economic status and primary responsibility for child-rearing.
q-sea – a tool for quality assessment of ethics analyses conducted as part of health technology assessments objectives although consideration of ethical issues is recognized as a crucial part of health technology assessment, ethics analysis for hta is generally perceived as methodologically underdeveloped in comparison to other hta domains. the aim of our study is (i) to verify existing tools for quality assessment of ethics analyses for hta, (ii) to consider some arguments for and against the need for quality assessment tools for ethics analyses for hta, and (iii) to propose a preliminary set of criteria that could be used for assessing the quality of ethics analyses for hta.   methods we systematically reviewed the literature, reviewed hta organizations' web sites, and solicited views from thirty-two experts in the field of ethics for hta.   results the database and hta agency web site searches yielded 420 references (413 from databases, seven from hta web sites). no formal instruments for assessing the quality of ethics analyses for hta purposes were identified. thirty-two experts in the field of ethics for hta from ten countries, who were brought together at two workshops held in edmonton (canada) and cologne (germany) confirmed the findings from the literature.   conclusions generating a quality assessment tool for ethics analyses in hta would confer considerable benefits, including methodological alignment with other areas of hta, increase in transparency and transferability of ethics analyses, and provision of common language between the various participants in the hta process. we propose key characteristics of quality assessment tools for this purpose, which can be applied to ethics analyses for hta purposes.
the effect of prmt1-mediated arginine methylation on the subcellular localization, stress granules, and detergent-insoluble aggregates of fus/tls mutations in fused in sarcoma (fus) are a cause of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fals). patients carrying point mutations in the c‐terminus of fus show neuronal cytoplasmic fus‐positive inclusions, whereas in healthy controls, fus is predominantly nuclear. cytoplasmic fus inclusions have also been identified in a subset of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (ftld‐fus). we show that a non‐classical py nuclear localization signal (nls) in the c‐terminus of fus is necessary for nuclear import. the majority of fals‐associated mutations occur within the nls and impair nuclear import to a degree that correlates with the age of disease onset. this presents the first case of disease‐causing mutations within a py‐nls. nuclear import of fus is dependent on transportin, and interference with this transport pathway leads to cytoplasmic redistribution and recruitment of fus into stress granules. moreover, proteins known to be stress granule markers co‐deposit with inclusions in fals and ftld‐fus patients, implicating stress granule formation in the pathogenesis of these diseases. we propose that two pathological hits, namely nuclear import defects and cellular stress, are involved in the pathogenesis of fus‐opathies.
pkcη regulates the tgfβ3-induced chondevrepogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cell protein kinase c eta (pkceta) is one of several pkc isoforms found in humans. it is a novel pkc isoform in that it is activated by diacylglycerol and anionic phospholipids but not calcium. the crystal structure of the pkceta-c2 domain, which is thought to mediate anionic phospholipid sensing in the protein, was determined at 1.75 a resolution. the structure is similar to that of the pkc epsilon c2 domain but with significant variations at the putative lipid-binding site. two serine residues within pkc eta were identified in vitro as potential autophosphorylation sites. in the unphosphorylated structure both serines line the putative lipid-binding site and may therefore play a role in the lipid-regulation of the kinase.
higher mrna levels of chemokines and cytokines associated with macrophage activation in erythema migrans skin lesions in patients from the united states than in patients from austria with lyme borreliosis. toll-like receptors (tlrs) are pattern recognition receptors that serve an important function in detecting pathogens and initiating inflammatory responses. upon encounter with foreign ag, dendritic cells (dcs) go through a maturation process characterized by an increase in surface expression of mhc class ii and costimulatory molecules, which leads to initiation of an effective immune response in naive t cells. the innate immune response to bacterial flagellin is mediated by tlr5, which is expressed on human dcs. therefore, we sought to investigate whether flagellin could induce dc maturation. immature dcs were cultured in the absence or presence of flagellin and monitored for expression of cell surface maturation markers. stimulation with flagellin induced increased surface expression of cd83, cd80, cd86, mhc class ii, and the lymph node-homing chemokine receptor ccr7. flagellin stimulated the expression of chemokines active on neutrophils (il-8/cxc chemokine ligand (cxcl)8, gro-α/cxcl1, gro-β/cxcl2, gro-γ/cxcl3), monocytes (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1/cc chemokine ligand (ccl)2), and immature dcs (macrophage-inflammatory protein-1α/ccl3, macrophage-inflammatory protein-1β/ccl4), but not chemokines active on effector t cells (ifn-inducible protein-10 kda/cxcl10, monokine induced by ifn-γ/cxcl9, ifn-inducible t cell α chemoattractant/cxcl11). however, stimulating dcs with both flagellin and ifn-inducible protein-10 kda, monokine induced by ifn-γ, and ifn-inducible t cell α chemoattractant expression, whereas stimulation with ifn-β or flagellin alone failed to induce these chemokines. in functional assays, flagellin-matured dcs displayed enhanced t cell stimulatory activity with a concomitant decrease in endocytic activity. finally, dcs isolated from mouse spleens or bone marrows were shown to not express tlr5 and were not responsive to flagellin stimulation. these results demonstrate that flagellin can directly stimulate human but not murine dc maturation, providing an additional mechanism by which motile bacteria can initiate an acquired immune response.
is the ecura system useful for selecting patients who require radical surgery after noncurative endoscopic submucosal dissection for early gastric cancer? a comparative study backgroundalthough radical surgery is routinely performed for patients who do not meet the curative criteria for endoscopic submucosal dissection (esd) for early gastric cancer (egc) due to the risk of lymph node metastasis (lnm), this standard therapeutic option may be excessive given the lower number of patients with lnm. therefore, we aimed to investigate long-term outcomes and validate risk factors predicting recurrence after esd.methodsof 15,785 patients who underwent esd for egc at 19 institutions between 2000 and 2011, 1969 patients not meeting the curative criteria were included in this multi-center study. based on the treatment strategy after esd, patients were divided into radical surgery (n = 1064) and follow-up (no additional treatment, n = 905) groups.resultsoverall survival (os) and disease-specific survival (dss) were significantly higher in the radical surgery group than in the follow-up group (p < 0.001 and p = 0.012, respectively). however, the difference in 3-year dss between the groups (99.4 vs. 98.7 %) was rather small compared with the difference in 3-year os (96.7 vs. 84.0 %). lnm was found in 89 patients (8.4 %) in the radical surgery group. lymphatic invasion was found to be an independent risk factor for recurrence in the follow-up group (hazard ratio 5.23; 95 % confidence interval 2.01–13.6; p = 0.001).conclusionsthis multi-center study, representing the largest cohort to date, revealed a large discrepancy between os and dss in the two groups. since follow-up with no additional treatment after esd may be an acceptable option for patients at low risk, further risk stratification is needed for appropriate individualized treatment strategies.
plant essential oils synergize and antagonize toxicity of different conventional insecticides against myzus persicae (hemiptera: aphididae) in recent years, the use of essential oils (eos) derived from aromatic plants as low-risk insecticides has increased considerably owing to their popularity with organic growers and environmentally conscious consumers. eos are easily produced by steam distillation of plant material and contain many volatile, low-molecular-weight terpenes and phenolics. the major plant families from which eos are extracted include myrtaceae, lauraceae, lamiaceae, and asteraceae. eos have repellent, insecticidal, and growth-reducing effects on a variety of insects. they have been used effectively to control preharvest and postharvest phytophagous insects and as insect repellents for biting flies and for home and garden insects. the compounds exert their activities on insects through neurotoxic effects involving several mechanisms, notably through gaba, octopamine synapses, and the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. with a few exceptions, their mammalian toxicity is low and environmental persistence is short. registration has been the main bottleneck in putting new products on the market, but more eos have been approved for use in the united states than elsewhere owing to reduced-risk processes for these materials.
a versatile chemo-enzymatic conjugation approach yields homogeneous and highly potent antibody-drug conjugates the linker component of antibody-drug conjugates (adc) is a key feature in developing optimized therapeutic agents that are highly active at well tolerated doses. for maximal intratumoral drug delivery, linkers are required that are highly stable in the systemic circulation, yet allow for efficient drug release at the target site. in this respect, amide bond-based technologies constitute a technological advancement, since the linker half-lives in circulation ( t 1/2 approximately 7 days) are much longer than earlier generation linkers that break down within 1-2 days. the amide linkers, some of which contain peptides, are appended to the mab carriers through thioether/maleimide adducts. here, we describe that use of a bromoacetamidecaproyl (bac) in place of the maleimidocaproyl (mc) increases the plasma stability of resulting thioether adcs. one such adc, 1f6-c4v2-bac-mmaf, which is directed against the cd70 antigen on lymphomas and renal cell carcinoma, was prepared containing a bac thioether spacer between the drug (mmaf) and the mab carrier (1f6-c4v2). there was no measurable systemic drug release from this adc for 2 weeks postadministration in mice. in order to assess the impact of improving linker stability beyond mc containing adcs, a series of mc and bac-linked 1f6-mmaf conjugates were compared for tolerability, intratumoral drug delivery, and therapeutic efficacy in nude mice with renal cell carcinoma xenografts. there were no statistically significant efficacy differences between sets of mc and bac containing adcs, although the bac linker technology led to 25% higher intratumoral drug exposure over a 7 day period compared to the corresponding mc linker. the mechanism of drug release from maleimide-adducts likely involves a retro-michael reaction that takes place in plasma, based on in vitro studies demonstrating that some of the released drug-maleimide derivative became covalently bound to cysteine-34 of serum albumin. in summary, the data indicate that new linkers can be obtained with improved in vivo stability by replacing the maleimide with an acetamide, but the resulting adcs had similar tolerability and activity profiles.
hepatocytes produce tnf-α following hypoxia-reoxygenation and liver ischemia-reperfusion in a nadph oxidase- and c-src-dependent manner. reactive oxygen species are ubiquitous signaling molecules in biological systems. four members of the nadph oxidase (nox) enzyme family are important sources of reactive oxygen species in the vasculature: nox1, nox2, nox4, and nox5. signaling cascades triggered by stresses, hormones, vasoactive agents, and cytokines control the expression and activity of these enzymes and of their regulatory subunits, among which p22phox, p47phox, noxa1, and p67phox are present in blood vessels. vascular nox enzymes are also regulated by rac, clc-3, poldip2, and protein disulfide isomerase. multiple nox subtypes, simultaneously present in different subcellular compartments, produce specific amounts of superoxide, some of which is rapidly converted to hydrogen peroxide. the identity and location of these reactive oxygen species, and of the enzymes that degrade them, determine their downstream signaling pathways. nox enzymes participate in a broad array of cellular functions, including differentiation, fibrosis, growth, proliferation, apoptosis, cytoskeletal regulation, migration, and contraction. they are involved in vascular pathologies such as hypertension, restenosis, inflammation, atherosclerosis, and diabetes. as our understanding of the regulation of these oxidases progresses, so will our ability to alter their functions and associated pathologies.
hairpins participating in folding of human telomeric sequence quadruplexes studied by standard and t-remd simulations explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations have been used to complement preceding experimental and computational studies of folding of guanine quadruplexes (g-dna). we initiate early stages of unfolding of several g-dnas by simulating them under no-salt conditions and then try to fold them back using standard excess salt simulations. there is a significant difference between g-dnas with all-anti parallel stranded stems and those with stems containing mixtures of syn and anti guanosines. the most natural rearrangement for all-anti stems is a vertical mutual slippage of the strands. this leads to stems with reduced numbers of tetrads during unfolding and a reduction of strand slippage during refolding. the presence of syn nucleotides prevents mutual strand slippage; therefore, the antiparallel and hybrid quadruplexes initiate unfolding via separation of the individual strands. the simulations confirm the capability of g-dna molecules to adopt numerous stable locally and globally misfolded structures. the key point for a proper individual folding attempt appears to be correct prior distribution of syn and anti nucleotides in all four g-strands. the results suggest that at the level of individual molecules, g-dna folding is an extremely multi-pathway process that is slowed by numerous misfolding arrangements stabilized on highly variable timescales.
time, space, and disorder in the expanding proteome universe we describe a proteomics method for determining the subcellular localization of membrane proteins. organelles are partially separated using centrifugation through self-generating density gradients. proteins from each organelle co-fractionate and therefore exhibit similar distributions in the gradient. protein distributions can be determined through a series of pair-wise comparisons of gradient fractions, using cleavable icat to enable relative quantitation of protein levels by ms. the localization of novel proteins is determined using multivariate data analysis techniques to match their distributions to those of proteins that are known to reside in specific organelles. using this approach, we have simultaneously demonstrated the localization of membrane proteins in both the endoplasmic reticulum and the golgi apparatus in arabidopsis. localization of organelle proteins by isotope tagging is a new tool for high-throughput protein localization, which is applicable to a wide range of research areas such as the study of organelle function and protein trafficking.
molecular cloning of two structure variants of crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (chh) from the swimming crab (portunus trituberculatus), and their gene expression during molting and ovarian development the present work shows for the first time that peptides belonging to the crustacean hyperglycaemic hormone family (chh-family hormones) from penaeus japonicus affect protein and mrna synthesis in in vitro-incubated ovarian explant fragments removed from vitellogenic females of penaeus semisulcatus. reduced levels of protein synthesis, determined by tca-precipitable 35s-labeled proteins, were found in the presence of crude sinus gland extracts from both p. semisulcatus and p. japonicus. a similar inhibitory effect compared to controls was found with each of the seven chh-family peptides. non-chh-family peptides did not reduce protein synthesis. crude sinus gland extracts prepared from p. semisulcatus were at least 20-fold more effective than sinus gland extracts of p. japonicus. the inhibition level was directly related to the concentration of the peptide in the incubation media, but its degree varied among the different tested peptides. the profile of proteins synthesized during in vitro incubation was analyzed using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denatured and reduced conditions (sds-page), followed by autoradiography. synthesis of several proteins was reduced, including proteins with electrophoretic mobility similar to that of vitellin. immunoprecipitation with antiserum prepared against native ovarian vitellin confirmed the inhibitory effect of chh-family peptides on vitellin synthesis. the crude sinus gland extract and chh-family peptides also inhibited rna synthesis, as determined by [3h]uridine incorporation into mrna of ovarian fragments. it is concluded that in addition to their role in carbohydrate metabolism, chh-family peptides may also influence ovarian physiology in crustaceans.
inborn errors of metabolism and the human interactome: a systems medicine approach given the functional interdependencies between the molecular components in a human cell, a disease is rarely a consequence of an abnormality in a single gene, but reflects the perturbations of the complex intracellular and intercellular network that links tissue and organ systems. the emerging tools of network medicine offer a platform to explore systematically not only the molecular complexity of a particular disease, leading to the identification of disease modules and pathways, but also the molecular relationships among apparently distinct (patho)phenotypes. advances in this direction are essential for identifying new disease genes, for uncovering the biological significance of disease-associated mutations identified by genome-wide association studies and full-genome sequencing, and for identifying drug targets and biomarkers for complex diseases.
a hidden structural vulnerability in the thrombospondin-2 deficient aorta increases the propensity to intramural delamination. thrombospondin 2 (tsp2)-null mice, generated by targeted disruption of the thbs2 gene, display a complex phenotype that is characterized, in part, by a variety of connective tissue abnormalities and increased vascular density in skin and subcutaneous tissues. in this paper we summarize the evidence that tsp2 functions as a matricellular protein to influence cell function by modulating cell-matrix interactions, rather than acting as an integral component of the matrix. thus, the structurally abnormal collagen fibrils detected in skin appear to be the consequence of the defective adhesion demonstrated by dermal fibroblasts in culture that, in turn, result from increased matrix metalloproteinase 2 (mmp2, gelatinase a) production by these cells. corroborating evidence for such a mode of action comes from transmission electron microscopic images of developing flexor muscle tendons that show distinct abnormalities in fibroblast-collagen fibril interactions in tsp2-null tissue. the increased vascular density seen in skin of tsp2-null mice can be reproduced in a number of models of injury, including subcutaneous implantation of polyvinyl alcohol sponges and silicone rubber discs, and excisional skin wounds. experiments are proposed to distinguish between a primarily endothelial cell versus an extracellular matrix origin for the increased angiogenesis in tsp2-null mice.
short‐term changes in the composition of active marine bacterial assemblages in response to diesel oil pollution in situ hybridization with rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes has become a widely applied tool for direct analysis of microbial population structures of complex natural and engineered systems. in such studies probe eub338 (amann et al., 1990) is routinely used to quantify members of the domain bacteria with a sufficiently high cellular ribosome content. recent reevaluations of probe eub338 coverage based on all publicly available 16s rrna sequences, however, indicated that important bacterial phyla, most notably the planctomycetales and verrucomicrobia, are missed by this probe. we therefore designed and evaluated two supplementary versions (eub338-ii and eub338-iii) of probe eub338 for in situ detection of most of those phyla not detected with probe eub338. in situ dissociation curves with target and non-target organisms were recorded under increasing stringency to optimize hybridization conditions. for that purpose a digital image software routine was developed. in situ hybridization of a complex biofilm community with the three eub338 probes demonstrated the presence of significant numbers of probe eub338-ii and eub338-iii target organisms. the application of eub338, eub338-ii and eub338-iii should allow a more accurate quantification of members of the domain bacteria in future molecular ecological studies.
genome-wide analysis of ring finger proteins in the smallest free-living photosynthetic eukaryote ostreococus tauri. the u box is a domain of ∼70 amino acids that is present in proteins from yeast to humans. the prototype u box protein, yeast ufd2, was identified as a ubiquitin chain assembly factor that cooperates with a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (e1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (e2), and a ubiquitin-protein ligase (e3) to catalyze ubiquitin chain formation on artificial substrates. e3 enzymes are thought to determine the substrate specificity of ubiquitination and have been classified into two families, the hect and ring finger families. six mammalian u box proteins have now been shown to mediate polyubiquitination in the presence of e1 and e2 and in the absence of e3. these u box proteins exhibited different specificities for e2 enzymes in this reaction. deletion of the u box or mutation of conserved amino acids within it abolished ubiquitination activity. some u box proteins catalyzed polyubiquitination by targeting lysine residues of ubiquitin other than lysine 48, which is utilized by hect and ring finger e3 enzymes for polyubiquitination that serves as a signal for proteolysis by the 26 s proteasome. these data suggest that u box proteins constitute a third family of e3 enzymes and that e4 activity may reflect a specialized type of e3 activity.
a theoretical and algorithmic characterization of bulge knees in this paper we address the problem of approximating the 'knee' of a bi-objective optimization problem with stochastic search algorithms. knees or entire knee-regions are of particular interest since such solutions are often preferred by the decision makers in many applications. here we propose and investigate two update strategies which can be used in combination with stochastic multi-objective search algorithms (e.g., evolutionary algorithms) and aim for the computation of the knee and the knee-region, respectively. finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the approach on two examples.
glucose repression/derepression in budding yeast: snf1 protein kinase is activated by phosphorylation under derepressing conditions, and this correlates with a high amp:atp ratio utilization of sucrose as a source of carbon and energy in yeast (saccharomyces) is controlled by the classical suc genes, which confer the ability to produce the sucrose-degrading enzyme invertase (mortimer and hawthorne 1969). mutants of s. cerevisiae strain s288c (suc2+) unable to grow anaerobically on sucrose, but still able to use glucose, were isolated. two major complementation groups were identified: twenty-four recessive mutations at the suc2 locus (suc2-); and five recessive mutations defining a new locus, snf1 (for sucrose nonfermenting), essential for sucrose utilization. two minor complementation groups, each comprising a single member with a leaky sucrose-nonfermenting phenotype, were also identified. the suc2 mutations isolated include four suppressible amber mutations and five mutations apparently exhibiting intragenic complementation; complementation analysis and mitotic mapping studies indicated that all of the suc2 mutations are alleles of a single gene. these results suggest that suc2 encodes a protein, probably a dimer or multimer. no invertase activity was detected in suc2 probably a dimer or multimer. no invertase activity was detected in suc2 mutants,--the snf1 locus is not tightly linked to suc2. the snf1 mutations were found to be pleiotropic, preventing sucrose utilization by suc2+ and suc7+ strains, and also preventing utilization of galactose, maltose and several nonfermentable carbon sources. although snf1 mutants thus display a petite phenotype, classic petite mutations do not interfere with utilization of sucrose, galactose or maltose. a common feature of all the carbon utilization systems affected by snf1 is that all are regulated by glucose repression. the snf1 mutants were found to produce the constitutive nonglycosylated form of invertase, but failed to produce the glucose-repressible, glycosylated, secreted invertase. this failure cannot be attributed to a general defect in production of glycosylated and secreted proteins because synthesis of acid phosphatase, a glycosylated secreted protein not subject to glucose repression, was not affected by snf1 mutations. these findings suggest that the snf1 locus is involved in the regulation of gene expression by glucose repression.
financing strategies to improve essential public health equalization and its effects in china backgroundin order to address several health challenges, the chinese government issued the national essential public health services package (nephsp) in 2009. in china’s large cities, the lack of funding for community health centers and consequent lack of comprehensive services and high quality care has become a major challenge. however, no study has been carried out to estimate the cost of delivering the services in the package. this project was to develop a cost estimation approach appropriate to the context and use it to calculate the cost of the nephsp in beijing in 2011.methodsby adjusting models of cost analysis of primary health care and workload indicators of staffing need developed by the world health organization, a model was developed to estimate the cost of the services in the package through an intensive interactive process. a total of 17 community health centers from eight administrative districts in beijing were selected. their service volume and expenditure data in 2010 were used to evaluate the costs of providing the nephsp in beijing based on the applied model.resultsthe total workload of all types of primary health care in 17 sample centers was equivalent to the workload requirement for 14,056,402 standard clinic visits. the total expenditure of the 17 sample centers was 26,329,357.62 usd in 2010. the cost of the workload requirement of one standard clinic visit was 1.87 usd. the workload of the nephsp was equivalent to 5,514,777 standard clinic visits (39.23 % of the total workload). the model suggests that the cost of the package in beijing was 7.95 usd per capita in 2010. the cost of the nephsp in urban areas was lower than suburban areas: 7.31 and 8.65 usd respectively.conclusionsthe average investment of 3.97 usd per capita in nephsp was lower than the amount needed to meet its running costs. nephsp in beijing is therefore underfunded. additional investment is needed, and a dynamic cost estimate mechanism should be introduced to ensure services remain adequately funded.
single-photon techniques for standard cmos digital ics photon counting is useful in space-based imagers wherever quantitative light-intensity evaluation is necessary. various types of radiation, from cosmic rays to high-energy proton beams to gamma radiation, have an effect on the functionality and accuracy of imagers and the literature is extensive [1,2]. techniques to maximize sensor tolerance have also been developed for a number of years and several imagers resistant to up to 30mrad (si) of gamma radiation have been reported. these sensors have several shortcomings: either significant noise performance degradation, up to several orders of magnitude [2], or unacceptably high pre-radiation noise levels [3]. in addition, many radiation-tolerant sensors use dedicated processes, thus possibly limiting their suitability for mass-market applications [4].
ibuprofen inhibits migration and proliferation of human coronary artery smooth muscle cells by inducing a differentiated phenotype: role of peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor γ the peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor‐γ (ppar‐γ) is constitutively expressed in primary cultures of rat microglia, the main population of brain resident macrophages, and its ligand‐dependent activation leads to the repression of several microglial functions. a few non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (nsaids), e.g. indomethacin and ibuprofen, show ppar‐γ agonistic properties. it has been proposed that ppar‐γ activation contributes to the potential benefits of the long‐term use of certain nsaids in delaying the progression of alzheimer's disease (ad). previous data have shown that the nsaid hct1026 [2‐fluoro‐α‐methyl(1,1′‐biphenyl)4‐acetic acid‐4‐(nitrooxy)butyl ester], a derivative of flurbiprofen which releases nitric oxide (no), reduces the number of reactive microglial cells in a variety of models. this evidence together with the chemical analogy with ibuprofen led us to investigate whether flurbiprofen and hct1026 interact with ppar‐γ and interfere with microglial activation. we found that a low concentration (1 µm) of hct1026, but not flurbiprofen, activated ppar‐γ in primary cultures of rat microglia, with kinetics similar to those of the synthetic agonist ciglitazone. the ppar‐γ antagonist gw9662 (2‐chloro‐5‐nitrobenzanilide) prevented the activation of ppar‐γ by hct1026. interestingly, unlike other nsaids that activate ppar‐γ at concentrations higher than those required for cyclooxygenase inhibition, hct1026 activated ppar‐γ and inhibited prostaglandin e2 synthesis at the same low concentration (1 µm). the results suggest that hct1026 may exert additional anti‐inflammatory actions through ppar‐γ activation, allowing a more effective control of microglial activation and brain inflammation.
bioaccumulation and ecotoxicity of carbon nanotubes the present study examined the roles of the specific surface area (ssa), diameter, and length of carbon nanotubes (cnt) on the adsorption of phenanthrene (pnt) by analyzing the adsorption isotherms obtained with several single-walled carbon nanotubes (swnt) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (mwnt). at low equilibrium concentrations (e.g., 1 ppb), mwnts with larger outer diameters exhibited higher pnt adsorption capacity on an ssa basis than those with smaller diameters. with increasing equilibrium concentration, adsorption on an ssa basis became independent of mwnt diameter, and the total surface area controlled maximum adsorption capacity. a similar analysis for the adsorption of naphthalene, a planar molecule with one less benzene ring but 20 times higher solubility than pnt, showed no correlation with respect to mwnt outer diameter. the results indicated that the surface curvature of mwnt was more important on the adsorption of pnt than on the adsorption of naphthalene. specific surface area normalized isotherms did not show a correlation between pnt adsorption and lengths of swnts and mwnts. characterization results indicated that the morphology of cnts plays an important role on the ssa and pore volume. data from the manufacturer may not always represent the characteristics of cnts in a particular batch. therefore, accurate characterization of cnts is critical to systematically examine the behavior of cnts, such as adsorption and transport, in environmental systems.
information caching strategy for cyber social computing based wireless networks understanding how users behave when they connect to social networking sites creates opportunities for better interface design, richer studies of social interactions, and improved design of content distribution systems. in this paper, we present a first of a kind analysis of user workloads in online social networks. our study is based on detailed clickstream data, collected over a 12-day period, summarizing http sessions of 37,024 users who accessed four popular social networks: orkut, myspace, hi5, and linkedin. the data were collected from a social network aggregator website in brazil, which enables users to connect to multiple social networks with a single authentication. our analysis of the clickstream data reveals key features of the social network workloads, such as how frequently people connect to social networks and for how long, as well as the types and sequences of activities that users conduct on these sites. additionally, we crawled the social network topology of orkut, so that we could analyze user interaction data in light of the social graph. our data analysis suggests insights into how users interact with friends in orkut, such as how frequently users visit their friends' or non-immediate friends' pages. in summary, our analysis demonstrates the power of using clickstream data in identifying patterns in social network workloads and social interactions. our analysis shows that browsing, which cannot be inferred from crawling publicly available data, accounts for 92% of all user activities. consequently, compared to using only crawled data, considering silent interactions like browsing friends' pages increases the measured level of interaction among users.
the minimum m3-m4 loop length of neurotransmitter-activated pentameric receptors is critical for the structural integrity of cytoplasmic portals* 1 a human recombinant homo‐oligomeric 5‐ht3 receptor (h5‐ht3a) expressed in a human embryonic kidney cell line (hek 293) was characterized using the whole‐cell recording configuration of the patch clamp technique. 2 5‐ht evoked transient inward currents (ec50= 3.4 μm; hill coefficient = 1.8) that were blocked by the 5‐ht3 receptor antagonist ondansetron (ic50= 103 pm) and by the non‐selective agents metoclopramide (ic50= 69 nm), cocaine (ic50= 459 nm) and (+)‐tubocurarine (ic50= 2.8 μm). 3 5‐ht‐induced currents rectified inwardly and reversed in sign (e5‐ht) at a potential of −2.2 mv. n‐methyl‐d‐glucamine was finitely permeant. permeability ratios pna/pcs and pnmdg/pcs were 0.90 and 0.083, respectively. 4 permeability towards divalent cations was assessed from measurements of e5‐ht in media where ca2+ and mg2+ replaced na+. pca/pcs and pmg/pcs were calculated to be 1.00 and 0.61, respectively. 5 single channel chord conductance (γ) estimated from fluctuation analysis of macroscopic currents increased with membrane hyperpolarization from 243 fs at −40 mv to 742 fs at −100 mv. 6 reducing [ca2+]o from 2 to 0.1 mm caused an increase in the whole‐cell current evoked by 5‐ht. a concomitant reduction in [mg2+]o produced further potentiation. fluctuation analysis indicates that a voltage‐independent augmentation of γ contributes to this phenomenon. 7 the data indicate that homo‐oligomeric receptors composed of h5‐ht3a subunits form inwardly rectifying cation‐selective ion channels of low conductance that are permeable to ca2+ and mg2+.
front-face fluorescence spectroscopy as a tool to classify seven bovine muscles according to their chemical and rheological characteristics. this paper reports the potential of synchronous front-face fluorescence spectroscopy in the characterization at the molecular level of milk changes during mild heating from 4 to 50 °c and acidification in the ph range of 6.8 to 5.1. synchronous fluorescence spectra were collected in the 250–550 nm excitation wavelength range using offsets of 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, and 240 nm between excitation and emission monochromators. the potential of parallel factor (parafac) analysis in the decomposition of the whole synchronous fluorescence data set into the contribution of each of the fluorescent compounds present in milk has been investigated for heating and acidification data sets. models were fitted from 1 to 7 components. considering the core consistency values, parafac models with three components have been considered. the first three components explained 94.43% and 94.13% of the total variance for heating and acidification data sets, respectively. the loading profiles of the first and second components derived from parafac analysis performed on heating and acidification data sets corresponded quite well with the characteristics of tryptophan and vitamin a fluorescence spectra, respectively. the third component corresponded to the riboflavin fluorescence spectrum. considering the heating experiment, the profile of the concentration mode for the second component showed large variations according to the temperature, which were assigned to the melting of triglycerides between 4 and 50 °c. for the acidification experiment, drastic changes in the concentration modes of the three components were observed for ph below 5.6, in agreement with structural changes in casein micelles.
tradeoffs between the axial resolution and the signal-to-noise ratio in elastography this paper presents a theoretical framework for performance characterization in strain estimation, which includes the effect of signal decorrelation, quantization errors due to the finite temporal sampling rate, and electronic noise. an upper bound on the performance of the strain estimator in elastography is obtained from a strain filter constructed using these limits. the strain filter is a term used to describe the nonlinear filtering process in the strain domain (due to the ultrasound system and signal processing parameters) that allows the elastographic depiction of a limited range of strains from the compressed tissue. the strain filter predicts the elastogram quality by specifying the elastographic signal-to-noise ratio (snr/sub e/), sensitivity, and the strain dynamic range at a given resolution. the dynamic range is limited by decorrelation errors for large tissue strain values, and electronic noise for low strain values. tradeoffs between different techniques used to enhance elastogram image quality may also be analyzed using the strain filter.
intermediate hosts of angiostrongylus cantonensis in tenerife, spain background angiostrongylus cantonensis is a lungworm of rats (muridae) that is the causative agent of human cerebral angiostrongyliasis. the life cycle of a. cantonensis involves rats and mollusks as the definitive and intermediate hosts, respectively. this study was designed to increase the knowledge about the occurrence and distribution of a. cantonensis in its definitive host in the canary islands, using parasitological and serological analysis in different areas and age groups. methodology/principal findings between 2009 and 2010, 54 black rats (rattus rattus) from tenerife were captured from six human-inhabited areas and sera samples were obtained. the lung nematodes were identified by morphological and molecular tools as a. cantonensis. the 31-kda glycoprotein antigen was purified from a. cantonensis adult worms by electrophoresis and electroelution. of the 54 tested rodents, 30 showed igg antibodies against a. cantonensis 31-kda antigen by elisa. therefore, the overall seroprevalence was 55.6% (95% ci: 42.4–68). seroprevalent rodents were found in all the 6 areas. this 31-kda antigen was not recognized by some sera of rats infected by other helminth species (but not a. cantonensis). seroprevalence of igg antibodies against a. cantonensis and prevalence based on the presence of adult worms showed significant correlation (r2 = 0.954, p<0.05). conclusions/significance the present results could indicate a high prevalence of a. cantonensis in tenerife and suggest the inclusion of two new zones in the distribution area of the parasite. the commonness and wide distribution of a. cantonensis in rats implies the presence of intermediate hosts, indicating that humans may be at risk of getting infected.
aerosol composition and sources in the central arctic ocean during ascos increases in anthropogenic aerosols in the atmosphere tend to increase the reflectance of solar (shortwave) radiation from water clouds, which can lead to lower surface temperatures. here an opposing effect whereby aerosols increase the longwave emissivity of thin clouds that adds to the warming of the earth’s surface, is discussed. the latter effect may be particularly important in the arctic, especially during the winter and early spring when thin stratus clouds are ubiquitous, relatively high levels of anthropogenic pollution are common, and there is little solar radiation.

prevalence and severity of ocular surface neoplasia in african nations and need for early interventions objective to examine the reliability of clinical examination and in vivo confocal microscopy (ivcm) in distinguishing ocular surface squamous neoplasia (ossn) from benign conjunctival lesions. design case-control study. participants sixty individuals with conjunctival lesions (ossn and benign) and 60 age-matched controls with normal conjunctiva presenting to kilimanjaro christian medical centre, moshi, tanzania. methods participants were examined and photographed, and ivcm was performed. patients with conjunctival lesions were offered excisional biopsy with histopathology and a human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) test. the ivcm images were read masked to the clinical appearance and pathology results. images were graded for several specific features and given an overall categorization (normal, benign, or malignant). a group of 8 ophthalmologists were shown photographs of conjunctival lesions and asked to independently classify as ossn or benign. main outcome measures comparison of the histopathology diagnosis with the clinical and ivcm diagnosis. results fifty-two cases underwent excisional biopsy with histopathology; 34 were on the ossn spectrum, 17 were benign, and 1 was lymphoma. the cases and controls had comparable demographic profiles. human immunodeficiency syndrome infection was more common in ossn compared with benign cases (58.8% vs. 5.6%; odds ratio, 24.3, 95% confidence interval [ci], 2.8–204; p = 0.003). clinically, ossn lesions more frequently exhibited feeder vessels and tended to have more leukoplakia and a gelatinous appearance. overall, the ophthalmologists showed moderate agreement with the histology result (average kappa = 0.51; 95% ci, 0.36–0.64). the masked grading of ivcm images reliably distinguished normal conjunctiva. however, ivcm was unable to reliably distinguish between benign lesions and ossn because of an overlap in their appearance (kappa = 0.44; 95% ci, 0.32–0.57). no single feature was significantly more frequent in ossn compared with benign lesions. the sensitivity and specificity of ivcm for distinguishing ossn from benign conjunctival lesions were 38.5% and 66.7%, respectively. conclusions in east africa, conjunctival pathology is relatively common and can present significant diagnostic challenges for the clinician. in this study, neither clinical examination nor ivcm was found to reliably distinguish ossn from benign conjunctival pathology because of an overlap in the features of these groups. therefore, ivcm cannot currently replace histopathology, and management decisions should continue to rely on careful clinical assessment supported by histopathology as indicated.
the effect of low oral doses of (−)-deprenyl and its metabolites on dsp-4 toxicity the role of monoamine oxidase b (mao-b) in r(-)-deprenyl-mediated rescue of rat facial motoneurons axotomized at postnatal day 14 (p14) was investigated using the (+)- and (-)-enantiomers of deprenyl [s(+)- deprenyl and r(-)-deprenyl]. previously, doses of r(-)-deprenyl sufficient to inhibit mao-b were shown to increase the survival of motoneurons following an apparent loss of target-derived trophic support caused by axotomy in p14 rats. in the present experiments, motoneuronal survival was measured 21 d after unilateral facial nerve transection at p14. the animals were treated with saline or doses of r(- )- or s(+)-deprenyl ranging from 0.001 to 10 mg/kg every 2 days (/2d). frontal serial 10 microns sections were taken through the length of the facial nuclei ipsilaterally and contralaterally to the facial nerve transections. every third section was immunoreacted for an antibody against chat to identify the motoneuron somata, while every adjacent third section was nissl stained to assess motoneuronal survival. a second series of p14 rats was treated with similar doses of the two deprenyl enantiomers or saline and the brainstems removed for measurement of mao-a and mao-b activity at 4 hr after the treatments. averages of 24% of the facial motoneurons survived axotomy with either saline treatment or 0.001 mg/kg/2d doses of r(-)-deprenyl. doses of r(- )-deprenyl of 0.005, 0.01, and 10.0 mg/kg/2d increased the surviving facial motoneuron to 38%, 51%, and 48%, respectively, indicating an ed50 of about 0.005 mg/kg/2d. doses of s(+)-deprenyl as high as 10 mg/kg/2d did not increase motoneuronal survival, revealing a stereospecificity for the increased survival of at least 2000-fold. the ed50 for mao-b inhibition in the p14 brainstem was approximately 0.1 mg/kg for the (-)-enantiomer and 2.0 mg/kg for the (+)-enantiomer, revealing a 20-fold higher sensitivity of the enzyme toward the (-)- enantiomer in the p14 rat brainstem. a dose of 10 mg/kg of s(+)- deprenyl inhibited about 65% of brainstem mao-b activity without increasing motoneuronal survival, whereas 0.005 and 0.01 mg/kg of r(-)- deprenyl increased motoneuronal survival without significant inhibition of brainstem mao-b activity.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
relationship between clinical and surgical findings and reparability of large and massive rotator cuff tears: a longitudinal study "cover the hole in the cuff." echoes from the past and voices from the present blend to give us the same message. the message is firm and authoritative, almost mesmerizing, yet almost unchanged since the time the edict was first issued by codman (1) almost 60 years ago. we all understand the concept of rotator cuff repair. it makes sense to repair a torn rotator cuff to its anatomic location. we restore the anatomy and hence restore the mechanics of the cuff. however, when faced with a massive tear that cannot be completely repaired, most orthopedic surgeons continue to be swayed by that ancient irresistible siren song of "cover the hole." a number of clever techniques have been used to cover the hole, including supraspinatus muscle slide (2), fascial graft (3), freeze-dried allograft (4), and tendon transposition (5,6). however, most of these techniques either ignore or openly violate the mechanics of the shoulder. a major purpose of this article is to encourage us as orthopedic surgeons to consider the multidisciplinary dimensions of a biologic problem: too often we seek biologic solutions to mechanical problems. for years, engineers have used professional horizontal cross-integration on major projects by employing experts from diverse fields to approach complex engineering problems. this allows the engineering team to evaluate a problem from a number of different perspectives. this approach reduces the possibility of overlooking some critically important
acetylcholinesterase plays a non-neuronal, non-esterase role in organogenesis despite in vitro demonstrations of non‐enzymatic morphogenetic functions in acetylcholinesterase (ache), the ache knockout phenotype is milder than might be expected, casting doubt upon the relevance of such functions in vivo. functional redundancy is a possible explanation. using in vitro findings that ache is able to bind to laminin‐111, together with detailed information about the interaction sites, as well as an epitope analysis of adhesion‐inhibiting anti‐ache mabs, we have used molecular docking and bioinformatics techniques to explore this idea, investigating structurally similar molecules that have a comparable spatiotemporal expression pattern in the embryonic nervous system. on this basis, molecules with which ache could be redundant are the syndecans, glypicans, perlecan, the receptor tyrosine kinase mer, and the low‐density lipoprotein receptor. it is also highly likely that ache may be redundant with the homologous neuroligins, although there is no evidence that the latter are expressed before synaptogenesis. ache was observed to dock with gas6, the ligand for mer, as well as with apolipoprotein e3 (but not apolipoprotein e4), both at the same site as the laminin interaction. these findings suggest that ache may show direct functional redundancy with one or more of these molecules; it is also possible that it may itself have a unique function in the stabilization of the basement membrane. as basement membrane molecules are characterized by multiple molecular interactions, each contributing cumulatively to the construction and stability of the network, this may account for ache’s apparently promiscuous interactions, and also for the survival of the knockout.
the welfare implications of using exotic tortoises as ecological replacements summarywe investigated seasonal changes in diet and distribution of giant tortoises (geochelone gigantea (schweigger)) on aldabra atoll in the indian ocean. animals were counted and their activity and feeding behaviour recorded on transects where vegetation composition and primary production had been studied (gibson and phillipson in press a, b).there were striking seasonal shifts in tortoise distribution, and male, female, and juvenile tortoises were found in different proportions in different vegetation types.tortoises are selective grazers, feeding on a wide range of foodstuffs of which the most important (61% of feeding observations) was tortoise turf. diet varied seasonally, with shrub leaves (mostly litter) overtaking tortoise turf in importance in the late dry season; diet broadened as the dry season progressed. male and female diets were not significantly different but juveniles fed on herbs and mosaic rock vegetation more often than adults.seasonal shifts in distribution are due to movements in response to changes in food availability, measured by the foods' cover abundances and production phenologies. tortoises concentrate on preferred foods when available, but become less selective as production falls. some differences in size and sex class distribution between habitats can also be explained by food availability.in the late dry season density peaks on the coastal sporobolus virginicus (l.) kunth sward. a detailed study showed that, while at least 20% of the population uses the sward each year, visit times are short and turnover of tortoises high, as would be expected on a non-preferred food.the giant tortoise interacts with its food supply similarly to other large herbivores, except that the low maintenance needs of this large poikilotherm allow it to develop unusually high population densities.
nicotine increases anterior insula activation to expected and unexpected outcomes among nonsmokers while dopamine systems have been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and psychosis for many years, how dopamine dysfunction generates psychotic symptoms remains unknown. recent theoretical interest has been directed at relating the known role of midbrain dopamine neurons in reinforcement learning, motivational salience and prediction error to explain the abnormal mental experience of psychosis. however, this theoretical model has yet to be explored empirically. to examine a link between psychotic experience, reward learning and dysfunction of the dopaminergic midbrain and associated target regions, we asked a group of first episode psychosis patients suffering from active positive symptoms and a group of healthy control participants to perform an instrumental reward conditioning experiment. we characterized neural responses using functional magnetic resonance imaging. we observed that patients with psychosis exhibit abnormal physiological responses associated with reward prediction error in the dopaminergic midbrain, striatum and limbic system, and we demonstrated subtle abnormalities in the ability of psychosis patients to discriminate between motivationally salient and neutral stimuli. this study provides the first evidence linking abnormal mesolimbic activity, reward learning and psychosis.
neurochemical organization of the turtle pretectum: an immunohistochemical study. comparative analysis the present study was carried out to examine if peptides similar to the various opioid peptide products of mammalian proenkephalin are present in the turtle central nervous system and to determine their distribution. antisera against several enkephalin peptides were used: (1) leucine‐enkephalin (lenk), (2) methionine‐enkephalin (menk), (3) methionine‐enkephalin‐arg6‐phe7 (merf), (4) methionine‐enkephalin‐arg6‐gly7‐leu8 (mergl), (5) peptide e (pepe), and (6) bam22p. their specificity and cross‐reactivity were carefully examined. the results indicated that lenk, menk, and merf (or highly similar peptides) are present in the turtle central nervous system, and that a peptide showing immunological similarity to bam22p and pepe also appeared to be present. in contrast, mergl did not appear to be present. the distributions of the immunoreactive labeling for lenk, menk, merf, bam22p, and pepe were indistinguishable, and double‐label studies showed that lenk, merf, and bam22p were colocalized within individual neurons and fibers. although all of the above substances were observed in the same cell groups, there was some regional variation, in terms of which enkephalin peptide appeared to be most abundant.
release of ethylbenzene and styrene from plastic cheese containers packaging has become an indispensible element in the food manufacturing process, and different types of additives, such as antioxidants, stabilizers, lubricants, anti-static and anti-blocking agents, have also been developed to improve the performance of polymeric packaging materials. recently the packaging has been found to represent a source of contamination itself through the migration of substances from the packaging into food. various analytical methods have been developed to analyze the migrants in the foodstuff, and migration evaluation procedures based on theoretical prediction of migration from plastic food contact material were also introduced recently. in this paper, the regulatory control, analytical methodology, factors affecting the migration and migration evaluation are reviewed.
effect of diet and exercise on body composition, energy intake and leptin levels in overweight women and men purpose the purpose of this study was to examine the physiological effects of a weight-loss dietary regimen with or without exercise.   methods thirty-five overweight men were matched and randomly placed into either a control group (c; n = 6) or one of three dietary groups; a diet-only group (d; n = 8), a diet group that performed aerobic exercise three times per week (de; n = 11); and a diet group that performed both aerobic and strength training three times per week (des; n = 10).   results after 12 wk, d, de, and des demonstrated a similar and significant (p < or = 0.05) reduction in body mass (-9.64, -8.99, and -9.90 kg, respectively) with fat mass comprising 69, 78, and 97% of the total loss in body mass, respectively. the diet-only group also demonstrated a significant reduction in fat-free mass. maximum strength, as determined by 1-rm testing in the bench press and squat exercise was significantly increased for des in both the bench press (+19.6%) and squat exercise (+32.6%). absolute peak o2 consumption was significantly elevated in de (+24.8%) and des (+15.4%). there were no differences in performance during a 30-s wingate test for the de and des, whereas d demonstrated a significant decline in peak and mean power output. resting metabolic rate (rmr) (kcal x d(-1)) was not significantly different for any of the groups except for the de group. there were no significant changes in basal concentrations of serum glucose, bun, cortisol, testosterone, and high density lipoprotein (hdl) cholesterol for any of the groups. serum total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol were significantly decreased for all dietary groups. serum triglycerides were significantly reduced for d and des at week 6 and remained lower at week 12 for d, while triglycerides returned to baseline values for des.   conclusions these data indicate that a weight-loss dietary regimen in conjunction with aerobic and resistance exercise prevents the normal decline in fat-free mass and muscular power and augments body composition, maximal strength, and maximum oxygen consumption compared with weight-loss induced by diet alone.
pid controller tuning using bode's integrals a method for automatic tuning of pid controllers in closed loop based on the estimation of a parametric "black-box" transfer function model is proposed. the system is excited by generating limit cycle oscillations at two different frequencies which are approximately the cross-over frequency and the critical frequency for the feedbck loop. a discrete parametric transfer function model is estimated from the experiment data. important parameters concerning the estimation such as prefilter cut-off frequency and sampling interval are determined automatically from the experiment data. the pid parameters are determined from a constrained optimization in the frequency domain. the constraints are classical control system properties such as maximum amplitudes of the sensitivity and the complementary sensitivity functions. other constraints can also be specified. given these constraints, the pid parameters are determined such that the low frequency amplitude characteristic for the controller is maximized. simulation experiments show that the tuning procedure has low sensitivity to disturbances and noise during the tuning experiment.
use of hf20 membrane in critically ill unstable low-body-weight infants on inotropic support background critically ill children with hemodynamic instability and acute kidney injury often develop fluid overload. continuous renal replacement therapy (crrt) has emerged as a favored modality in the management of such children. this study investigated the association between fluid overload and mortality in children receiving crrt.   study design prospective observational study.   setting & participants 297 children from 13 centers across the united states participating in the prospective pediatric crrt registry.   predictor fluid overload from intensive care unit (icu) admission to crrt initiation, defined as a percentage equal to (fluid in [l] - fluid out [l])/(icu admit weight [kg]) x 100%.   outcome & measurements the primary outcome was survival to pediatric icu discharge. data were collected regarding demographics, crrt parameters, underlying disease process, and severity of illness.   results 153 patients (51.5%) developed < 10% fluid overload, 51 patients (17.2%) developed 10%-20% fluid overload, and 93 patients (31.3%) developed > or = 20% fluid overload. patients who developed > or = 20% fluid overload at crrt initiation had significantly higher mortality (61/93; 65.6%) than those who had 10%-20% fluid overload (22/51; 43.1%) and those with < 10% fluid overload (45/153; 29.4%). the association between degree of fluid overload and mortality remained after adjusting for intergroup differences and severity of illness. the adjusted mortality or was 1.03 (95% ci, 1.01-1.05), suggesting a 3% increase in mortality for each 1% increase in severity of fluid overload. when fluid overload was dichotomized to > or = 20% and < 20%, patients with > or = 20% fluid overload had an adjusted mortality or of 8.5 (95% ci, 2.8-25.7).   limitations this was an observational study; interventions were not standardized. the relationship between fluid overload and mortality remains an association without definitive evidence of causality.   conclusions critically ill children who develop greater fluid overload before initiation of crrt experience higher mortality than those with less fluid overload. further goal-directed research is required to accurately define optimal fluid overload thresholds for initiation of crrt.
a physical map for the amborella trichopoda genome sheds light on the evolution of angiosperm genome structure the abc model of floral organ identity is based on studies of arabidopsis and antirrhinum, both of which are highly derived eudicots. most of the genes required for the abc functions in arabidopsis and antirrhinum are members of the mads-box gene family, and their orthologs are present in all major angiosperm lineages. although the eudicots comprise 75% of all angiosperms, most of the diversity in arrangement and number of floral parts is actually found among basal angiosperm lineages, for which little is known about the genes that control floral development. to investigate the conservation and divergence of expression patterns of floral mads-box genes in basal angiosperms relative to eudicot model systems, we isolated several floral mads-box genes and examined their expression patterns in representative species, including amborella (amborellaceae), nuphar (nymphaeaceae) and illicium (austrobaileyales), the successive sister groups to all other extant angiosperms, plus magnolia and asimina, members of the large magnoliid clade. our results from multiple methods (relative-quantitative rt-pcr, real-time pcr and rna in situ hybridization) revealed that expression patterns of floral mads-box genes in basal angiosperms are broader than those of their counterparts in eudicots and monocots. in particular, (i) ap1 homologs are generally expressed in all floral organs and leaves, (ii) ap3/pi homologs are generally expressed in all floral organs and (iii) ag homologs are expressed in stamens and carpels of most basal angiosperms, in agreement with the expectations of the abc model; however, an ag homolog is also expressed in the tepals of illicium. the broader range of strong expression of ap3/pi homologs is inferred to be the ancestral pattern for all angiosperms and is also consistent with the gradual morphological intergradations often observed between adjacent floral organs in basal angiosperms.
tumor necrosis factor-α suppresses adipocyte-specific genes and activates expression of preadipocyte genes in 3t3-l1 adipocytes: nuclear factor-κb activation by tnf-α is obligatory tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf) has recently been shown to induce insulin resistance. we have examined the possible effect of tnf on the early events in insulin transmembrane signaling. incubation of the insulin-sensitive rat hepatoma fao cells with 5 nm tnf for 1 h led to a 65% decrease in insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of both the insulin receptor beta-subunit and irs-1, its major cytosolic substrate. tnf-induced impairment of tyrosine phosphorylation was maximal at 0.5 nm and was not accompanied by any reduction in insulin binding. sixteen hours of tnf incubation led to further impairment in insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins. our findings suggest that tnf may exert its anti-insulin effect by interrupting the early insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation events, which are crucial to insulin transmembrane signaling.
nicotianamine synthase specifically expressed in root nodules of lotus japonicus basic cellular processes such as electron transport in photosynthesis and respiration require the precise control of iron homeostasis. to mobilize iron, plants have evolved at least two different strategies. the nonproteinogenous amino acid nicotianamine which is synthesized from three molecules of s-adenosyl-l-methionine, is an essential component of both pathways. this compound is missing in the tomato mutant chloronerva, which exhibits severe defects in the regulation of iron metabolism. we report the purification and partial characterization of the nicotianamine synthase from barley roots as well as the cloning of two corresponding gene sequences. the function of the gene sequence has been verified by overexpression in escherichia coli. further confirmation comes from reduction of the nicotianamine content and the exhibition of a chloronerva-like phenotype due to the expression of heterologous antisense constructs in transgenic tobacco plants. the native enzyme with an apparent mr of approximately 105 000 probably represents a trimer of s-adenosyl-l-methionine-binding subunits. a comparison with the recently cloned chloronerva gene of tomato reveals striking sequence homology, providing support for the suggestion that the destruction of the nicotianamine synthase encoding gene is the molecular basis of the tomato mutation.
monocular core zones and binocular border strips in primate striate cortex revealed by the contrasting effects of enucleation, eyelid suture, and retinal laser lesions on cytochrome oxidase activity monkey models were used to examine the effects of competition for cortical territory between two eyes which were deprived simultaneously, but each eye experienced a different type of deprivation. we wanted to determine whether, under this condition of binocular unequal deprivation, the postnatal process of segregation into ocular dominance columns proceeds according to the same rules as those that apply to competition between a deprived and an undeprived fellow eye. our models involved surgical removal of the natural lens from one eye in newborn rhesus monkeys. the resulting aphakia was corrected optically to a near point with extended‐wear contact lenses. the fellow eyes were either left unmanipulated or occluded with opaque contact lenses for varying periods during the day. at the end of the rearing period, some monkeys from each experimental group had either one eye enucleated or sustained injury to the retinal ganglion cells of one eye. the histochemical reaction for cytochrome oxidase was used to reveal the widths of ocular dominance columns in layer 4c of striate cortex in these monkeys. under all experimental conditions, the axons related to the two eyes occupied segregated fields. the amount of cortical territory related to the aphakic, optically corrected eye depended on the manipulations of the fellow eye. in competition with an unmanipulated fellow eye, the aphakic eye's territory was greatly reduced. in competition with a part‐time occluded eye, its territory was reduced to a lesser degree, depending on the duration of the occlusion. in competition with a continuously occluded eye, however, the space related to the aphakic, optically corrected eye was slightly greater than that related to the occluded eye. since neither the aphakic nor the continuously occluded eye receives normal visual input, they are both impaired. therefore, they may compete on an almost equal basis for synaptic territory in layer 4c of striate cortex. moreover, it is likely that activities originating in the aphakic and the continuously occluded eye are asynchronous, and that this condition is sufficient to drive the postnatal segregation of inputs from the two deprived eyes.
the brain craving for gambling? neurosciences and addiction concept in clinical practice in the present paper we discuss the current status of drug treatment for pathological gambling and the scientific rationales underlying the various pharmacological approaches. specifically, we summarize the treatment study results of serotonin reuptake inhibitors, mood stabilizers, opioid antagonists, and atypical antipsychotics in pathological gambling. we also discuss dosage strategies, the duration of treatment, issues surrounding medication compliance, and approaches to treatment-refractory pathological gambling, such as pharmacological and behavioral augmentation.
eicosapentaenoic acid prevents atrial fibrillation associated with heart failure in a rabbit model. eicosapentaenoic acid (epa) has been reported to have beneficial effects on the progression of various renal diseases including diabetic nephropathy; however, the precise mechanisms are not completely understood. we examined the effects of epa on the early stage of type 2 diabetic nephropathy in kka(y)/ta mice and the possible role of inflammation, oxidative stress, and growth factor in this process. kka(y)/ta mice were divided into 2 groups. the treatment group was injected with epa ethyl ester at 1 g/kg per day intraperitoneally from 12 to 20 weeks of age and the control group was injected with saline. renal morphologic examinations were performed after 8 weeks of treatment. glomerular macrophage infiltration and expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, malondialdehyde (mda), nitrotyrosine, transforming growth factor beta1 (tgf-beta1), and type i collagen were evaluated. eicosapentaenoic acid decreased the levels of urinary albumin, serum triglyceride and mda, and improved glucose intolerance in kka(y)/ta mice. morphometric analysis showed that accumulation of extracellular matrix and the tubulointerstitial fibrosis area were significantly decreased after treatment. immunohistochemistry revealed that glomerular macrophage infiltration and the expression of mda and nitrotyrosine in kka(y)/ta mice were increased and were inhibited by epa treatment. protein and gene expression levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, tgf-beta1, and type i collagen, which were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, were down-regulated in the epa treatment group. in conclusion, epa improves type 2 diabetic nephropathy in kka(y)/ta mice. this beneficial effect might be mediated by attenuation of metabolic abnormalities and inhibition of renal inflammation, oxidative stress, and tgf-beta expression.
pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine responses to a 164-km road cycle ride in a hot environment elevated antigen-stimulated anti-inflammatory cytokine production appears to be a risk factor for upper respiratory tract illness in athletes. the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of prolonged exercise and hydration on antigen-stimulated cytokine production. twelve healthy males cycled for 120 min at 60% v˙o2max⁡ on two occasions, either euhydrated or moderately hypohydrated (induced by fluid restriction for 24 h). blood samples were collected before and after exercise and following 2 h recovery for determination of cell counts, plasma cortisol, and in vitro antigen-stimulated cytokine production by whole blood culture. fluid restriction resulted in mean body mass loss of 1.3% and 3.9% before and after exercise, respectively. exercise elicited a significant leukocytosis and elevated plasma cortisol, with no differences between trials. il-6 production was significantly reduced 2 h postexercise (p < 0.05), while il-10 production was elevated postexercise (p < 0.05). ifn-γ and il-2 production tended to decrease postexercise. no significant effect of hydration status was observed for the measured variables. prolonged exercise appears to result in augmented anti-inflammatory cytokine release in response to antigen challenge, possibly coupled with acute suppression of proinflammatory cytokine production, corresponding with studies using mitogen or endotoxin as stimulant. moderate hypohydration does not appear to influence these changes.
range-wide analysis of wildlife habitat: implications for conservation it is generally perceived that biodiversity is better protected from human activities after an area is designated as a protected area. however, we found that this common perception was not true in wolong nature reserve (southwestern china), which was established in 1975 as a “flagship” protected area for the world-renowned endangered giant pandas. analyses of remote sensing data from pre- and post-establishment periods indicate that the reserve has become more fragmented and less suitable for giant panda habitation. the rate of loss of high-quality habitat after the reserve's establishment was much higher than before the reserve was created, and the fragmentation of high-quality habitat became far more severe. after the creation of the reserve, rates of habitat loss and fragmentation inside the reserve unexpectedly increased to levels that were similar to or higher than those outside the reserve, in contrast to the situation before the reserve was created.
laparoscopic stripping of endometriomas: a randomized trial on different surgical techniques. part i: clinical results. the management of large endometriomas was described in a series of 814 patients. combined therapy using gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (gnrha) and carbon dioxide laser laparoscopy was proposed. drainage and gnrha for 12 weeks provoked a reduction of the endometrioma size up to 50% of the initial value. after vaporization of the internal wall, a cumulative pregnancy of 51% after 1 year was achieved. a recurrence rate of 8% was observed for a follow-up of 2-11 years. histological data demonstrated that the epithelium covering the ovary which is the mesothelium can invaginate in the ovarian cortex. some of the invaginations were seen to be continuous with endometrial tissue, strongly suggesting the metaplasia theory in the pathogenesis of ovarian endometrioma.
effects of early-fruit removal on endogenous cytokinins and abscisic acid in relation to leaf senescence in cotton leaf senescence varies greatly among cotton cultivars, possibly due to their root characteristics, particularly the root-sourced cytokinins and abscisic acid (aba). early-senescence (k1) and late-senescence (k2) lines, were reciprocally or self-grafted to examine the effects of rootstock on leaf senescence and endogenous hormones in both leaves and xylem sap. the results indicate that the graft of k1 scion onto k2 rootstock (k1/k2) alleviated leaf senescence with enhanced photosynthetic (pn) rate, increased levels of chlorophyll (chl) and total soluble protein (tsp), concurrently with reduced malondialdehyde (mda) contents in the fourth leaf on the main-stem. the graft of k2 scion onto k1 rootstock enhanced leaf senescence with reduced pn, chl, and tsp, and increased mda, compared with their respective self-grafted control plants (k1/k1 and k2/k2). reciprocally grafted plants differed significantly from their self-grafted control plants in levels of zeatin and its riboside (z+zr), isopentenyl and its adenine (ip+ipa), and aba, but not in those of dihydrozeatin and its riboside (dhz+dhzr) in leaves in late season, which was consistent with variations in leaf senescence between reciprocally and self-grafted plants. the results suggest that leaf senescence is closely associated with reduced accumulation of z+zr, and ip+ipa rather than dhz+dhzr, or enhanced aba in leaves of cotton. genotypic variation in leaf senescence may result from the difference in root characteristics, particularly in z+zr, ip+ipa, and aba which are regulated by the root system directly or indirectly.
systematic review of factors influencing length of stay in icu after adult cardiac surgery objective:followingcardiacsurgery, agreat varietyinintensivecareunit(icu)stayis observed,makingitoftendifficulttoadequatelypredict icu stay preoperatively. therefore, a study was conducted to investigate, which preoperative variables are independent risk factors for a prolonged icu stay and whether a patient’s risk of experiencing an extended icu stay can be estimated from these predictors. methods: the records of 1566 consecutive adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery at our institution were analysed retrospectively over a 2-year period. procedures included in the analyses were coronary artery bypass grafting, valve replacement or repair, ascending and aortic arch surgery, ventricular rupture and aneurysm repair, septal myectomy and cardiac tumour surgery. for this patient group, icu stay was registered and 57 preoperative variables were collected for analysis. descriptives and log-rank tests were calculated and kaplan—meier curves drawn for all variables. significant predictors in the univariate analyses were included in a cox proportional hazards model. the definitive model was validated on an independent sample of 395 consecutive adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery at our institution over an additional 6-month period. in this patient group, the accuracy and discriminative abilities of the model were evaluated. results: twelve independent preoperative predictors of prolonged icu stay were identified: age at surgery > 75 years, female gender, dyspnoea status > new york heart association class ii (nyha ii), unstable symptoms, impaired kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (egfr) colour flow mapping (cfm) grade ii, inotropic support, intra-aortic balloon pumping (iabp), non-elective procedures and aortic surgery. the individual effect of every predictor on icu stay was quantified and inserted into a mathematical algorithm (called the morbidity defining cardiosurgical (mdc) index), making it possible to calculate a patient’s risk of having an extended icu stay. the model showed very good calibration and very good to excellent discriminative ability in predicting icu stay >2, >5 and >7 days (c-statistic of 0.78; 0.82 and 0.85, respectively). conclusions: twelve independent preoperative risk factors for a prolonged icu stay following cardiac surgery were identified and constructed into a proportional hazards model. using this risk model, one can predict whether a patient will have a prolonged icu stay or not. # 2010 european association for cardio-thoracic surgery. published by elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.
word recognition and syntactic attachment in reading: evidence for a staged architecture. contrasting predictions of serial and parallel views on the processing of foveal and parafoveal information during reading were tested. a high-frequency adjective (young) was followed by either a high-frequency wordn (child) or a low-frequency wordn (tenor), which in turn was followed by either a correct (performing) or an orthographic illegal wordn + 1 (pxvforming) as a parafoveal preview. a limited parafoveal-on-foveal effect was observed: there were inflated fixation times on wordn when the preview of wordn + 1 was orthographically illegal. however, this parafoveal-on-foveal effect was (a) independent of the frequency of wordn, (b) restricted to those instances when the eyes were very close to wordn + 1, and (c) associated with relatively long prior saccades. these observations are all compatible with a mislocated fixation account in which parafoveal-on-foveal effects result from saccadic undershoots of wordn + 1 and with a serial model of eye movement control during reading.
incremental local gaussian regression novel applications in unstructured and non-stationary human environments require robots that learn from experience and adapt autonomously to changing conditions. predictive models therefore not only need to be accurate, but should also be updated incrementally in real-time and require minimal human intervention. incremental sparse spectrum gaussian process regression is an algorithm that is targeted specifically for use in this context. rather than developing a novel algorithm from the ground up, the method is based on the thoroughly studied gaussian process regression algorithm, therefore ensuring a solid theoretical foundation. non-linearity and a bounded update complexity are achieved simultaneously by means of a finite dimensional random feature mapping that approximates a kernel function. as a result, the computational cost for each update remains constant over time. finally, algorithmic simplicity and support for automated hyperparameter optimization ensures convenience when employed in practice. empirical validation on a number of synthetic and real-life learning problems confirms that the performance of incremental sparse spectrum gaussian process regression is superior with respect to the popular locally weighted projection regression, while computational requirements are found to be significantly lower. the method is therefore particularly suited for learning with real-time constraints or when computational resources are limited.
the anti-ovarian cancer activity by wye-132, a mtorc1/2 dual inhibitor sphingolipid metabolites have emerged as critical players in a number of fundamental biological processes. among them, sphingosine-1-phosphate (s1p) promotes cell survival and proliferation, in contrast to ceramide and sphingosine, which induce cell growth arrest and apoptosis. these sphingolipids with opposing functions are interconvertible inside cells, suggesting that a finely tuned balance between them can determine cell fate. sphingosine kinases (sphks), which catalyze the phosphorylation of sphingosine to s1p, are critical regulators of this balance. of the two identified sphks, sphingosine kinase type 1 (sphk1) has been shown to regulate various processes important for cancer progression and will be the focus of this review, since much less is known of biological functions of sphk2, especially in cancer. sphk1 is overexpressed in various types of cancers and upregulation of sphk1 has been associated with tumor angiogenesis and resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. many growth factors, through their tyrosine kinase receptors (rtks), stimulate sphk1 leading to a rapid increase in s1p. this s1p in turn can activate s1p receptors and their downstream signaling. conversely, activation of s1p receptors can induce transactivation of various rtks. thus, sphk1 may play important roles in s1p receptor rtk amplification loops. here we review the role of sphk1 in tumorigenesis, hormonal therapy, chemotherapy resistance, and as a prognostic marker. we will also review studies on the effects of sphk inhibitors in cells in vitro and in animals in vivo and in some clinical trials and highlight the potential of sphk1 as a new target for cancer therapeutics.
amino acid substitutions in hemagglutinin of the 2009 pandemic influenza a(h1n1) viruses that might affect the viral antigenicity to the editor: the preferential binding of influenza virus to sialic acid-α2,3-galactose (α2,3 receptor) or sialic acid-α2,6-galactose (α2,6 receptors) may determine its tropism as α2,3 and α2,6 receptors are dominant on lower and upper respiratory cells respectively [1]. the recent glycan microarray analysis suggested that the haemagglutinin (ha) d222g substitution could cause a shift from α2,6 receptors to the mixed α2,3/α2,6 receptors specificity which might increase binding to α2,3 receptors [2] and contribute to severity of disease. this substitution in the ha gene has been reported in samples of viruses obtained from cases with mild to severe illness from around 20 countries, areas and territories [3]. a recent study from norway has evaluated the clinical relevance of this substitution with severe and mild cases [4]. in an attempt to understand the relevance of ha d222g substitution among pandemic influenza a (h1n1) causing infections in hong kong, ha gene sequences from respiratory specimens and virus isolates of severe and non-severe cases were examined. cases were individuals who had laboratory confirmed pandemic h1n1 influenza virus by either viral culture or reverse transcription pcr (rt-pcr) of respiratory specimens [5]. the severe cases were individuals classified by the attending physician as being in a serious or critical condition.
association studies in qtl regions linked to bovine trypanotolerance in a west african crossbred population. one hundred and forty six calving interval records were built up from 64 n'dama cows maintained for 3.5 years under a high natural tsetse challenge in zaire. matching health and performance data were recorded monthly to allow simultaneous evaluation of the effects of different criteria of trypanotolerance represented by time detected parasitaemic, parasitaemia score and packed red cell volume percent (pcv) on reproductive performance, calf weaning weight and cow productivity. control of development of anaemia, measured by pcv value during trypanosome infection, had the major effect on all three performance traits. the repeatability of this criterion (0.33) was almost equal to that of calf weaning weight, indicating pcv measurement might be suitable for identification of more trypanotolerant animals. simultaneous evaluation of the relative effects of control of development of anaemia in both the pre-weaner calf and its dam, on calf performance, suggested that its measurement in an animal might be feasible at an early post-weaner stage. guidelines for work to develop practical field tests for trypanotolerance involving post-weaners maintained for varying lengths of time in high natural challenge situations are suggested.
early metazoan divergence was about 830 million years ago previously we suggested that four proteins including aldolase and triose phosphate isomerase (tpi) evolved with approximately constant rates over long periods covering the whole animal phyla. the constant rates of aldolase and tpi evolution were reexamined based on three different models for estimating evolutionary distances. it was shown that the evolutionary rates remain essentially unchanged in comparisons not only between different classes of vertebrates but also between vertebrates and arthropods and even between animals and plants, irrespective of the models used. thus these enzymes might be useful molecular clocks for inferring divergence times of animal phyla. to know the divergence time of parazoa and eumetazoa and that of cephalochordata and vertebrata, the aldolase cdnas from ephydatia fluviatilis, a freshwater sponge, and the tpi cdnas from ephydatia fluviatilis and branchiostoma belcheri, an amphioxus, have been cloned and se-quenced. comparisons of the deduced amino acid sequences of aldolase and tpi from the freshwater sponge with known sequences revealed that the parazoa-eumetazoa split occurred about 940 million years ago (ma) as determined by the average of two proteins and three models. similarly, the aldolase and tpi clocks suggest that vertebrates and amphioxus last shared a common ancestor around 700 ma and they possibly diverged shortly after the divergence of deuterostomes and protostomes.
asymptotic throughput of stochastic max-plus linear systems the lower and average spectral radii measure, respectively, the minimal and average growth rates of long products of matrices taken from a finite set. the logarithm of the average spectral radius is traditionally called the lyapunov exponent. when one performs these products in the max-algebra, we obtain quantities that measure the performance of discrete event systems. we show that approximating the lower and average max-algebraic spectral radii is np-hard.
feline bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (mscs) show similar phenotype and functions with regards to neuronal differentiation as human mscs. nestin is an intermediate filament most related to neurofilaments and expressed predominantly in the developing nervous system and muscles. in the present study we examined the in vivo distribution of nestin in human teeth during embryonic development and in permanent teeth under normal and pathological conditions. the results show that nestin is first expressed at the bell stage and that its distribution is restricted in pulpal cells located at the cusp area of the fetal teeth. in young permanent teeth, nestin is found only in functional odontoblasts, which produce the hard tissue matrix of dentin. expression is progressively down-regulated and nestin is absent from older permanent teeth. in carious and injured teeth, nestin expression is up-regulated in a selective manner in odontoblasts surrounding the injury site, showing a link between tissue repair competence and nestin up-regulation under pathological conditions. in an in vitro assay system of human dental pulp explants, nestin is up-regulated after local application of bone morphogenic protein-4. a similar effect is seen in cultures of primary pulp cells during their differentiation into odontoblasts. taken together, these results suggest that nestin plays a potential role in odontoblast differentiation during normal and pathological conditions and that bone morphogenic protein-4 is involved in nestin up-regulation.
ifn-α confers resistance of systemic lupus erythematosus nephritis to therapy in nzb/w f1 mice costimulatory blockade with ctla4ig and anti-cd40l along with a single dose of cyclophosphamide induces remission of systemic lupus erythematosus nephritis in nzb/w f1 mice. to understand the mechanisms for remission and for impending relapse, we examined the expression profiles of 61 inflammatory molecules in the perfused kidneys of treated mice and untreated mice at different stages of disease. further studies using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry allowed us to determine the cellular origins of several key markers. we show that only a limited set of inflammatory mediators is expressed in the kidney following glomerular immune complex deposition but before the onset of proteinuria. formation of a lymphoid aggregate in the renal pelvis precedes the invasion of the kidney by inflammatory cells. regulatory molecules are expressed early in the disease process and during remission but do not prevent the inevitable progression of active inflammation. onset of proliferative glomerulonephritis and proteinuria is associated with activation of the renal endothelium, expression of chemokines that mediate glomerular cell infiltration, and infiltration by activated dendritic cells and macrophages that migrate to different topographical areas of the kidney but express a similar profile of inflammatory cytokines. increasing interstitial infiltration by macrophages and progressive tubular damage, manifested by production of lipocalin-2, occur later in the disease process. studies of treated mice identify a type ii (m2b)-activated macrophage as a marker of remission induction and impending relapse and suggest that therapy for systemic lupus erythematosus nephritis should include strategies that prevent both activation of monocytes and their migration to the kidney.
coexistence of multiple genotypes of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus with novel mutant s genes in the hubei province of china in 2016 abstract receptor recognition by viruses is the first and essential step of viral infections of host cells. it is an important determinant of viral host range and cross-species infection and a primary target for antiviral intervention. coronaviruses recognize a variety of host receptors, infect many hosts, and are health threats to humans and animals. the receptor-binding s1 subunit of coronavirus spike proteins contains two distinctive domains, the n-terminal domain (s1-ntd) and the c-terminal domain (s1-ctd), both of which can function as receptor-binding domains (rbds). s1-ntds and s1-ctds from three major coronavirus genera recognize at least four protein receptors and three sugar receptors and demonstrate a complex receptor recognition pattern. for example, highly similar coronavirus s1-ctds within the same genus can recognize different receptors, whereas very different coronavirus s1-ctds from different genera can recognize the same receptor. moreover, coronavirus s1-ntds can recognize either protein or sugar receptors. structural studies in the past decade have elucidated many of the puzzles associated with coronavirus-receptor interactions. this article reviews the latest knowledge on the receptor recognition mechanisms of coronaviruses and discusses how coronaviruses have evolved their complex receptor recognition pattern. it also summarizes important principles that govern receptor recognition by viruses in general.
increased brain iron coincides with early plaque formation in a mouse model of alzheimer's disease objective: to determine whether changes in brain biometals in alzheimer disease (ad) and in normal brain tissue are tandemly associated with amyloid β-peptide (aβ) burden and dementia severity. methods: the authors measured zinc, copper, iron, manganese, and aluminum and aβ levels in postmortem neocortical tissue from patients with ad (n = 10), normal age-matched control subjects (n = 14), patients with schizophrenia (n = 26), and patients with schizophrenia with amyloid (n = 8). severity of cognitive impairment was assessed with the clinical dementia rating scale (cdr). results: there was a significant, more than twofold, increase of tissue zinc in the ad-affected cortex compared with the other groups. zinc levels increased with tissue amyloid levels. zinc levels were significantly elevated in the most severely demented cases (cdr 4 to 5) and in cases that had an amyloid burden greater than 8 plaques/mm2. levels of other metals did not differ between groups. conclusions: brain zinc accumulation is a prominent feature of advanced alzheimer disease (ad) and is biochemically linked to brain amyloid β-peptide accumulation and dementia severity in ad.
tradeoff between enzyme and metabolite efficiency maintains metabolic homeostasis upon perturbations in enzyme capacity motivation the simulation of biochemical kinetic systems is a powerful approach that can be used for: (i) checking the consistency of a postulated model with a set of experimental measurements, (ii) answering 'what if?' questions and (iii) exploring possible behaviours of a model. here we describe a generic approach to combine numerical optimization methods with biochemical kinetic simulations, which is suitable for use in the rational design of improved metabolic pathways with industrial significance (metabolic engineering) and for solving the inverse problem of metabolic pathways, i.e. the estimation of parameters from measured variables.   results we discuss the suitability of various optimization methods, focusing especially on their ability or otherwise to find global optima. we recommend that a suite of diverse optimization methods should be available in simulation software as no single one performs best for all problems. we describe how we have implemented such a simulation-optimization strategy in the biochemical kinetics simulator gepasi and present examples of its application.   availability the new version of gepasi (3.20), incorporating the methodology described here, is available on the internet at http://gepasi.dbs.aber.ac.uk/softw/gepasi. html.   contact prm@aber.ac.uk
epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr )-targeted immunoliposomes mediate specific and efficient drug delivery to egfr-and egfrviii-overexpressing tumor cells 1 purpose anti-her2 immunoliposomes combine the tumor-targeting of certain anti-her2 monoclonal antibodies (mabs) with the pharmacokinetic and drug delivery capabilities of sterically stabilized liposomes. we previously showed that anti-her2 immunoliposomes bind efficiently to and internalize in her2-overexpressing cells in vitro, resulting in intracellular drug delivery.   experimental design here we describe the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy of anti-her2 immunoliposomes containing doxorubicin (dox) in a series of animal models.   results immunoliposomes displayed long circulation that was identical to that of sterically stabilized liposomes in single- and multiple-dose studies in normal rats. anti-her2 immunoliposome-dox produced marked therapeutic results in four different her2-overexpressing tumor xenograft models, including growth inhibition, regression, and cures. these results demonstrated that encapsulation of dox in anti-her2 immunoliposomes greatly increased its therapeutic index, both by increasing antitumor efficacy and by reducing systemic toxicity. immunoliposome-dox was significantly superior to all other treatment conditions tested, including free dox, liposomal dox, and anti-her2 mab (trastuzumab). when compared with liposomal dox in eight separate therapy studies in her2-overexpressing models, immunoliposome delivery produced significantly superior antitumor efficacy in each study (p < 0.0001 to 0.04). anti-her2 immunoliposome-dox containing either recombinant human mab her2-fab' or scfv c6.5 yielded comparable therapeutic efficacy. cure rates for immunoliposome-dox reached 50% (11 of 21) with optimized immunoliposomes and matrigel-free tumors and overall was 16% (18 of 115) versus no cures (0 of 124) with free dox or liposomal dox. finally, anti-her2 immunoliposome-dox was also superior to combinations consisting of free mab plus free dox or free mab plus liposomal dox.   conclusions anti-her2 immunoliposomes produced enhanced antitumor efficacy via targeted delivery.
combinatorial gene regulatory functions underlie ultraconserved elements in drosophila identifying the sequences that direct the spatial and temporal expression of genes and defining their function in vivo remains a significant challenge in the annotation of vertebrate genomes. one major obstacle is the lack of experimentally validated training sets. in this study, we made use of extreme evolutionary sequence conservation as a filter to identify putative gene regulatory elements, and characterized the in vivo enhancer activity of a large group of non-coding elements in the human genome that are conserved in human–pufferfish, takifugu (fugu) rubripes, or ultraconserved in human–mouse–rat. we tested 167 of these extremely conserved sequences in a transgenic mouse enhancer assay. here we report that 45% of these sequences functioned reproducibly as tissue-specific enhancers of gene expression at embryonic day 11.5. while directing expression in a broad range of anatomical structures in the embryo, the majority of the 75 enhancers directed expression to various regions of the developing nervous system. we identified sequence signatures enriched in a subset of these elements that targeted forebrain expression, and used these features to rank all ∼3,100 non-coding elements in the human genome that are conserved between human and fugu. the testing of the top predictions in transgenic mice resulted in a threefold enrichment for sequences with forebrain enhancer activity. these data dramatically expand the catalogue of human gene enhancers that have been characterized in vivo, and illustrate the utility of such training sets for a variety of biological applications, including decoding the regulatory vocabulary of the human genome.
tcr-cxcr4 signaling stabilizes cytokine mrna transcripts via a prex1-rac1 pathway: implications for ctcl. c-kit positive cardiac stem cells (cscs) have been shown to contribute to myocardial regeneration after infarction. previously, we have shown that the c-kit ligand stem cell factor (scf) can induce csc migration into the infarcted area during myocardial infarction (mi). however, the precise mechanism involved is not fully understood. in this study, we found that cscs also express c-x-c chemokine receptor type 4 (cxcr4), which is a typical member of the seven transmembrane-spanning g protein-coupled receptor (gpcr). in vitro, activation of c-kit signalling by scf promotes migration of cscs with increased phosphorylation of cxcr4-serine 339, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 mapk) and extracellular regulated protein kinases 1/2 (erk1/2). knockdown of cxcr4 expression by sirna reduces scf/c-kit-induced migration and downstream signalling. as previously reported, cxcr4-serine 339 phosphorylation is mainly regulated by gpcr kinase 6 (grk6); thus, silencing of grk6 expression by sirna impairs cxcr4-serine 339 phosphorylation and migration of cscs caused by scf. in vivo, knockdown of grk6 impairs the ability of cscs to migrate into peri-infarcted areas. these results demonstrate that scf-induced csc migration is regulated by the transactivation of cxcr4-serine 339 phosphorylation, which is mediated by grk6.
central venous saturation in septic shock: co-oximetry vs gasometry. background goal-directed therapy has been used for severe sepsis and septic shock in the intensive care unit. this approach involves adjustments of cardiac preload, afterload, and contractility to balance oxygen delivery with oxygen demand. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of early goal-directed therapy before admission to the intensive care unit. methods we randomly assigned patients who arrived at an urban emergency department with severe sepsis or septic shock to receive either six hours of early goal-directed therapy or standard therapy (as a control) before admission to the intensive care unit. clinicians who subsequently assumed the care of the patients were blinded to the treatment assignment. in-hospital mortality (the primary efficacy outcome), end points with respect to resuscitation, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (apache ii) scores were obtained serially for 72 hours and compared between the study groups. results of the 263 enrolled patients, 130 were ...
neighborhood context and immigrant children's physical activity. context research examining the association between environmental attributes and physical activity among youth is growing. an updated review of literature is needed to summarize the current evidence base, and to inform policies and environmental interventions to promote active lifestyles among young people.   evidence acquisition a literature search was conducted using the active living research (alr) literature database, an online database that codes study characteristics and results of published papers on built/social environment and physical activity/obesity/sedentary behavior. papers in the alr database were identified through pubmed, web of science, and sportdiscus using systematically developed and expert-validated search protocols. for the current review, additional inclusion criteria were used to select observational, quantitative studies among youth aged 3-18 years.   evidence synthesis papers were categorized by design features, sample characteristics, and measurement mode. relevant results were summarized, stratified by age (children or adolescents) and mode of measurement (objective or perceived) for environmental attributes and physical activity. percentage of significant results was calculated.   conclusions mode of measurement greatly influenced the consistency of associations between environmental attributes and youth physical activity. for both children and adolescents, the most consistent associations involved objectively measured environmental attributes and reported physical activity. the most supported correlates for children were walkability, traffic speed/volume, access/proximity to recreation facilities, land-use mix, and residential density. the most supported correlates for adolescents were land-use mix and residential density. these findings support several recommendations for policy and environmental change from such groups as the iom and national physical activity plan.
gregarious sexual segregation: the unusual social organization of the malagasy narrow-striped mongoose (mungotictis decemlineata) the diversity of extant carnivores provides valuable opportunities for comparative research to illuminate general patterns of mammalian social evolution. recent field studies on mongooses (herpestidae), in particular, have generated detailed behavioural and demographic data allowing tests of assumptions and predictions of theories of social evolution. the first studies of the social systems of their closest relatives, the malagasy eupleridae, also have been initiated. the literature on mongooses was last reviewed over 25 years ago. in this review, we summarise the current state of knowledge on the social organisation, mating systems and social structure (especially competition and cooperation) of the two mongoose families. our second aim is to evaluate the contributions of these studies to a better understanding of mammalian social evolution in general. based on published reports or anecdotal information, we can classify 16 of the 34 species of herpestidae as solitary and nine as group‐living; there are insufficient data available for the remainder. there is a strong phylogenetic signal of sociality with permanent complex groups being limited to the genera crossarchus, helogale, liberiictis, mungos, and suricata. our review also indicates that studies of solitary and social mongooses have been conducted within different theoretical frameworks: whereas solitary species and transitions to gregariousness have been mainly investigated in relation to ecological determinants, the study of social patterns of highly social mongooses has instead been based on reproductive skew theory. in some group‐living species, group size and composition were found to determine reproductive competition and cooperative breeding through group augmentation. infanticide risk and inbreeding avoidance connect social organisation and social structure with reproductive tactics and life histories, but their specific impact on mongoose sociality is still difficult to evaluate. however, the level of reproductive skew in social mongooses is not only determined by the costs and benefits of suppressing each other's breeding attempts, but also influenced by resource abundance. thus, dispersal, as a consequence of eviction, is also linked to the costs of co‐breeding in the context of food competition. by linking these facts, we show that the socio‐ecological model and reproductive skew theory share some determinants of social patterns. we also conclude that due to their long bio‐geographical isolation and divergent selection pressures, future studies of the social systems of the eupleridae will be of great value for the elucidation of general patterns in carnivore social evolution.
intradural prostate carcinoma metastatic lesion mimicking an exophytic ependymoma: case report the management of 10 patients with symptomatic localized intradural extramedullary spinal metastasis is reviewed. the single most common primary source was carcinoma of the breast (four cases). the initial symptom in nine patients was pain, with five patients reporting a characteristically severe cramping discomfort with radicular distribution. all patients underwent laminectomy decompression. at the time of surgery, six of the patients were weak but ambulatory and four were bedridden. following surgery, four patients enjoyed some measure of pain relief, seven patients became ambulatory, and three remained bedridden. two patients achieved a "satisfactory" result, and were walking and continent 6 months after surgery. secondary brain tumors were demonstrated or implicated in nine patients, supporting the concept that the spinal metastases represented tertiary deposits following dissemination via the cerebrospinal fluid. symptomatic intradural extramedullary spinal metastasis causes a virulent clinical syndrome with poor prognosis and disappointing outcome after treatment. given the high incidence of associated cerebral metastatic involvement, total neuraxis radiation and/or chemotherapy should be considered when symptomatic spinal metastasis is discovered to be intradural and extramedullary.
contribution of 5‐ht to locomotion – the paradox of pet‐1−/− mice in vivo and in vitro experiments were performed in control (c3h) and monoamine oxidase a (maoa)-deficient (tg8) neonatal mice to determine whether maoa deficiency affected spinal locomotor network maturation. comparing the swimming behaviors at birth in c3h mice with those in tg8 mice revealed a delayed role for the hindlimbs in tg8 swimming, even though adult swimming behavior was acquired at postnatal day 14 (p14) in both strains. analyzing the locomotor network activity in vitro showed that serotonin (5-ht) induced and modulated locomotor-like discharges in hindlimb ventral roots of c3h but not tg8 neonates. the tg8 network began, however, to be affected by 5-ht at p11. thus both in vivo and in vitro results argue for a transient delay of locomotor network maturation in the tg8 strain.
multiview absolute pose using 3d – 2d perspective line correspondences and vertical direction a large number of absolute pose algorithms have been presented in the literature. common performance criteria are computational complexity, geometric optimality, global optimality, structural degeneracies, and the number of solutions. the ability to handle minimal sets of correspondences, resulting solution multiplicity, and generalized cameras are further desirable properties. this paper presents the first pnp solution that unifies all the above desirable properties within a single algorithm. we compare our result to state-of-the-art minimal, non-minimal, central, and non-central pnp algorithms, and demonstrate universal applicability, competitive noise resilience, and superior computational efficiency. our algorithm is called unified pnp (upnp).
inhibition of yeast-to-hypha transition in candida albicans by phorbasin h isolated from phorbas sp. abstract candida albicans expresses specific virulence traits that promote disease establishment and progression. these traits include morphological transitions between yeast and hyphal growth forms that are thought to contribute to dissemination and invasion and cell surface adhesins that promote attachment to the host. here, we describe the regulation of the adhesin gene als3, which is expressed specifically during hyphal development in c. albicans. using a combination of reporter constructs and regulatory mutants, we show that this regulation is mediated by multiple factors at the transcriptional level. the analysis of als3 promoter deletions revealed that this promoter contains two activation regions: one is essential for activation during hyphal development, while the second increases the amplitude of this activation. further deletion analyses using the renilla reniformis luciferase reporter delineate the essential activation region between positions −471 and −321 of the promoter. further 5′ or 3′ deletions block activation. als3 transcription is repressed mainly by nrg1 and tup1, but rfg1 contributes to this repression. efg1, tec1, and bcr1 are essential for the transcriptional activation of als3, with tec1 mediating its effects indirectly through bcr1 rather than through the putative tec1 sites in the als3 promoter. als3 transcription is not affected by cph2, but cph1 contributes to full als3 activation. the data suggest that multiple morphogenetic signaling pathways operate through the promoter of this adhesin gene to mediate its developmental regulation in this major fungal pathogen.
cox-2/mpges-1/pge2 cascade activation mediates uric acid-induced mesangial cell proliferation hyperuricemia is associated with renal disease, but it is usually considered a marker of renal dysfunction rather than a risk factor for progression. recent studies have reported that mild hyperuricemia in normal rats induced by the uricase inhibitor, oxonic acid (oa), results in hypertension, intrarenal vascular disease, and renal injury. this led to the hypothesis that uric acid may contribute to progressive renal disease. to examine the effect of hyperuricemia on renal disease progression, rats were fed 2% oa for 6 wk after 5/6 remnant kidney (rk) surgery with or without the xanthine oxidase inhibitor, allopurinol, or the uricosuric agent, benziodarone. renal function and histologic studies were performed at 6 wk. given observations that uric acid induces vascular disease, the effect of uric acid on vascular smooth muscle cells in culture was also examined. rk rats developed transient hyperuricemia (2.7 mg/dl at week 2), but then levels returned to baseline by week 6 (1.4 mg/dl). in contrast, rk+oa rats developed higher and more persistent hyperuricemia (6 wk, 3.2 mg/dl). hyperuricemic rats demonstrated higher bp, greater proteinuria, and higher serum creatinine than rk rats. hyperuricemic rk rats had more renal hypertrophy and greater glomerulosclerosis (24.2 +/- 2.5 versus 17.5 +/- 3.4%; p < 0.05) and interstitial fibrosis (1.89 +/- 0.45 versus 1.52 +/- 0.47; p < 0.05). hyperuricemic rats developed vascular disease consisting of thickening of the preglomerular arteries with smooth muscle cell proliferation; these changes were significantly more severe than a historical rk group with similar bp. allopurinol significantly reduced uric acid levels and blocked the renal functional and histologic changes. benziodarone reduced uric acid levels less effectively and only partially improved bp and renal function, with minimal effect on the vascular changes. to better understand the mechanism for the vascular disease, the expression of cox-2 and renin were examined. hyperuricemic rats showed increased renal renin and cox-2 expression, the latter especially in preglomerular arterial vessels. in in vitro studies, cultured vascular smooth muscle cells incubated with uric acid also generated cox-2 with time-dependent proliferation, which was prevented by either a cox-2 or txa-2 receptor inhibitor. hyperuricemia accelerates renal progression in the rk model via a mechanism linked to high systemic bp and cox-2-mediated, thromboxane-induced vascular disease. these studies provide direct evidence that uric acid may be a true mediator of renal disease and progression.
'good ethics and moral standing': a qualitative study of aesthetic leadership in clinical nursing practice. the australian nursing workforce is ageing and there is a well-documented shortage of nurses. this global phenomenon means that retaining nurses in the workforce is gaining in importance as older nurses retire and leave nursing. the existing literature reveals deficiencies in knowledge about older nurses as they adapt to ageing often within stressful work environments. the aim of this narrative-based study, informed by feminist principles, was to explore the views and experiences of female registered nurses aged 40-60 years, in acute hospital and community health care settings. in-depth semi-structured interviews of approximately 1 h duration were gathered during late 2004. the transcribed narratives were subjected to thematic analysis. two major themes were identified. the first theme: "feeling uncared for" contained three sub-themes--unsupportive work relationships: "we should be helping each other"; workplace bullying: "it hurts me and i feel really bad"; and, stress and burnout: "it's just like being in a pressure cooker all the time". the second major theme identified was "adapting to ageing: my nursing career". findings of this research suggest some unmet support needs for older nurses in the workforce which could discourage them from remaining in nursing. the findings highlight a need for further research into the support needs of older nurses.
retinoic acid enhances the production of il-10 while reducing the synthesis of il-12 and tnf-α from lps-stimulated monocytes/macrophages background measles kills about 2 million children annually, and there is no specific therapy for the disease. it has been suggested that vitamin a may be of benefit in the treatment of measles.   methods we conducted a randomized, double-blind trial involving 189 children who were hospitalized at a regional center in south africa because of measles complicated by pneumonia, diarrhea, or croup. the children (median age, 10 months) were assigned to receive either vitamin a (total dose, 400,000 iu of retinyl palmitate, given orally; n = 92) or placebo (n = 97), beginning within five days of the onset of the rash. at base line, the characteristics of the two groups were similar.   results although clinically apparent vitamin a deficiency is rare in this population, the children's serum retinol levels were markedly depressed (mean [+/- sem], 0.405 +/- 0.021 mumols per liter [11.6 +/- 0.6 micrograms per deciliter]), and 92 percent of them had hyporetinemia (serum retinol level less than 0.7 mumols per liter [20 micrograms per deciliter]). serum concentrations of retinol-binding protein (mean, 30.1 +/- 2.0 mg per liter) and albumin (mean, 33.4 +/- 0.5 g per liter) were also low. as compared with the placebo group, the children who received vitamin a recovered more rapidly from pneumonia (mean, 6.3 vs. 12.4 days, respectively; p less than 0.001) and diarrhea (mean, 5.6 vs. 8.5 days; p less than 0.001), had less croup (13 vs. 27 cases; p = 0.03), and spent fewer days in the hospital (mean, 10.6 vs. 14.8 days; p = 0.01). of the 12 children who died, 10 were among those given placebo (p = 0.05). for the group treated with vitamin a, the risk of death or a major complication during the hospital stay was half that of the control group (relative risk, 0.51; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.35 to 0.74).   conclusions treatment with vitamin a reduces morbidity and mortality in measles, and all children with severe measles should be given vitamin a supplements, whether or not they are thought to have a nutritional deficiency.
the balance of serum matrix metalloproteinase-8 and its tissue inhibitor in acute coronary syndrome and its recurrence. objective the imbalance between matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) 1, 3, and 9 and their specific inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (timp-1), is a critical step in cartilage injury and angiogenesis in arthritis. to explore the therapeutic potential of timp-1 gene transfer in erosive arthritis, the effects of an adenoviral vector (ad-timp-1) were assessed in dba/1 mice with collagen-induced arthritis (cia).   methods dba/1 mice with cia received an intravenous injection of replication-deficient adenovirus containing the human timp-1 gene or a control lacz gene on day 28 postimmunization. the efficiency of gene transfer was determined by serum timp-1 detection, measurements of paw swelling, as well as radiologic and histologic examination of the paws.   results a single administration of ad-timp-1 resulted in detectable serum levels of the exogenous protein for at least 13 days. the incidence and onset of arthritis were not statistically modified after human timp-1 gene transfer in dba/1 mice compared with control mice. however, the severity of inflammation was statistically significantly increased in ad-timp-1-treated mice and a similar trend was observed in the histologic and radiologic scores. with regard to the mechanisms of the worsened effect in the ad-timp-1-treated mice, we observed 1) higher serum levels of anti-type ii collagen igg2a, 2) a significant increase in endogenous soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor i (tnfri) in sera, and 3) increased labeling of mouse tumor necrosis factor alpha and tnfri within arthritic joints.   conclusion these findings show that overexpression of timp-1 does not prevent osteochondral injury in a mouse model of arthritis. since mmps have overlapping properties in terms of their roles in extracellular matrix degradation, angiogenesis, and shedding of cell surface adhesion molecules, cytokines, and cytokine receptors, the paradoxical results obtained suggest that timp-1 is probably not the main inhibitor to target.
cuneate and spinal trigeminal nucleus projections to the cochlear nucleus are differentially associated with vesicular glutamate transporter-2 the cochlear nucleus (cn) is the first auditory structure to receive binaural information via cn-commissural connections. in spite of an abundance of evidence that cn-commissural neurons are glycinergic and thus inhibitory, physiological, and anatomical evidence suggests that a small group of cn-commissural neurons are excitatory. in this study, we examined the excitatory portion of the cn-commissural pathway by combining anterograde tract tracing with immunohistochemistry of vesicular glutamate transporters (vgluts) and retrograde tract tracing with immunohistochemistry of glycine and gaba. vgluts accumulate glutamate in synaptic vesicles and are prime markers for glutamatergic neurons. the terminal endings of cn-commissural projections were typically en passant or small terminal boutons, but large, irregular swellings were also observed, confined to the granule cell domain (gcd). both small and large terminal endings in the gcd colabeled with vglut2, but not vglut1. in addition, some cn-commissural cells themselves received vglut2-positive puncta on their somata. after large injections into the cn, 37% of the total number of retrogradely labeled commissural neurons was immunonegative to glycine or gaba. retrograde labeling after a restricted gcd injection revealed a majority of putative excitatory cn-commissural neurons as multipolar, in the marginal regions of the ventral cn, medially as well as in the small cell cap region and deep dorsal cn. these results provide direct anatomical evidence that an excitatory commissural projection is present, and vglut2 is associated with this pathway both as its source and as a recipient.
coral-associated bacterial assemblages: current knowledge and the potential for climate-driven impacts. abstract we investigated which microbial taxa in coastal red sea water were stimulated by addition of mucus from the coral fungia sp. decreases in the concentration and c/n ratio of particulate organic material during short-term incubations (50 h) were paralleled by a steep rise in the number of gammaproteobacteria, particularly alteromonadaceae, followed by vibrionaceae. two almost identical genotypes affiliated with alteromonas macleodii accounted for up to >85% of all alteromonadaceae (45% of the total cells) in the mucus-amended enrichments but were rare in unamended control incubations and in ambient seawater. a. macleodii-like bacteria might thus be important in the transfer of organic carbon from coral mucus to the pelagic microbial food webs of coral reefs.
chemobrain experienced by breast cancer survivors: a meta-ethnography study investigating research and care implications aims and objectives to investigate women's awareness of chemotherapy-induced cognitive changes, their perception of cognitive limitations in carrying out daily tasks and subsequent return to work decisions and perceptions of work ability.   background evidence suggests that women diagnosed with breast cancer experience cognitive changes as a consequence of chemotherapy treatment. although these changes tend to be subtle deficits in memory, concentration and the ability to organise information, there has been no published research identifying how they can impact patient's ability to work and subsequent employment decisions.   design this was a qualitative study.   method data were collected from breast cancer survivors using semi-structured interviews with two focus groups (n = 6, n = 7). interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using template analysis.   results data were categorised into four main themes: (1) awareness of cognitive changes during and following chemotherapy, (2) cognitive ability and confidence in return to work, (3) impact of cognitive changes on work ability and (4) information on the cognitive side effects of chemotherapy.   conclusions the views and experiences of breast cancer survivors towards returning to work and subsequent work ability were affected by chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment. more specifically the appraisal of returning to work and ability to manage work were influenced by three interrelated factors: (1) actual cognitive ability following chemotherapy, (2) awareness of cognitive failures by the women and their families and (3) the subsequent impact on their confidence in carrying out daily tasks including work tasks.   relevance to clinical practice more information and support is needed to help patients with cancer to manage chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairments in home and workplace. nurses are increasingly asked about the impact of cancer and its treatment on work and are therefore well positioned to offer this advice. subsequently, nurses require additional knowledge and guidance to provide this information and support.
bioaccumulation and ecotoxicity of carbon nanotubes the present study examined the roles of the specific surface area (ssa), diameter, and length of carbon nanotubes (cnt) on the adsorption of phenanthrene (pnt) by analyzing the adsorption isotherms obtained with several single-walled carbon nanotubes (swnt) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (mwnt). at low equilibrium concentrations (e.g., 1 ppb), mwnts with larger outer diameters exhibited higher pnt adsorption capacity on an ssa basis than those with smaller diameters. with increasing equilibrium concentration, adsorption on an ssa basis became independent of mwnt diameter, and the total surface area controlled maximum adsorption capacity. a similar analysis for the adsorption of naphthalene, a planar molecule with one less benzene ring but 20 times higher solubility than pnt, showed no correlation with respect to mwnt outer diameter. the results indicated that the surface curvature of mwnt was more important on the adsorption of pnt than on the adsorption of naphthalene. specific surface area normalized isotherms did not show a correlation between pnt adsorption and lengths of swnts and mwnts. characterization results indicated that the morphology of cnts plays an important role on the ssa and pore volume. data from the manufacturer may not always represent the characteristics of cnts in a particular batch. therefore, accurate characterization of cnts is critical to systematically examine the behavior of cnts, such as adsorption and transport, in environmental systems.
antagonizing deactivating cytokines to enhance host defense and chemotherapy in experimental visceral leishmaniasis in experimental leishmania donovani infection in balb/c mice, initial susceptibility gives way to t-cell-dependent acquired resistance and eventual control over visceral infection. since various cytokines appear to underlie the host response to leishmania infection, we examined infected liver tissue for gene expression of cytokines associated with th1 (gamma interferon [ifn-gamma] and interleukin-2 [il-2]) and th2 cells (il-4 and il-10). by northern (rna) blot analysis, only ifn-gamma mrna expression was detected in livers of infected euthymic mice. to determine whether activation of th1 cells develops selectively in this model, qualitative pcr analysis was used. these results indicated that mrnas for ifn-gamma, il-2, il-4, and il-10 were all induced by l. donovani infection. the potentially negative th2 cell-associated response did not appear to play a functional role, however, since resistance was acquired, anti-il-4 monoclonal antibody treatment did not accelerate control over visceral infection, and serum immunoglobulin e levels remained low. as judged by pcr analysis, il-4 and il-10 mrnas were also expressed under three other conditions without apparent effect: in naive euthymic mice treated with il-2, which induces leishmanicidal activity; in rechallenged immune mice, which resist reinfection; and in nude mice, which fail to control l. donovani. these results suggest that, like other leishmania species, l. donovani infection may trigger a potentially suppressive th2 cell-associated cytokine response. however, in t-cell-intact mice able to control l. donovani, this response either is insufficient to influence outcome or more likely is overshadowed by the th1 cell response.
anatomical features associated with venous congestion in diep flap using ct angiography with three-dimensional reconstruction background: despite improving outcomes, venous problems in the harvest of deep inferior epigastric artery perforator (diep) flaps remain the more common vascular complications. however, it is apparent that the venous anatomy of the anterior abdominal wall has not been described to the same extent as the arterial anatomy. previous anatomical studies have focused on cadaveric anatomy or excisional specimens. the current study uses in vivo computed tomographic angiography to evaluate this anatomy, in combination with a cadaveric radiographic study. methods: both cadaveric and in vivo studies were undertaken using eight whole fresh cadaveric specimens (16 sides) and 100 patients undergoing diep flap breast reconstruction (200 sides). the cadaveric component used direct catheter venography and the in vivo studies were undertaken using preoperative computed tomographic angiography, mapping in vivo venous flow. results: the location, caliber, course, and distribution of the superficial and deep inferior epigastric veins were recorded. the dominance of each system and their direction of drainage were described. mechanisms for poor venous drainage were postulated, including perforator size, midline crossover of the superficial inferior epigastric vein, and the superficial and deep inferior epigastric vein communications. the incidence of each of these anatomical factors was evaluated. conclusion: the cause of venous compromise is multifactorial, with the current study showing that preoperative computed tomographic angiography may predict venous problems during flap harvest, by demonstrating perforator diameter, midline crossover, and deep-superficial venous communications.
elements of quality assurance at institutions of higher education: vaal university of technology in south africa the organizational and social issues associated with the development, implementation and use of computer‐based information systems have increasingly attracted the attention of information systems researchers. interest in qualitative research methods such as action research, case study research and ethnography, which focus on understanding social phenomena in their natural setting, has consequently grown. case study research is the most widely used qualitative research method in information systems research, and is well suited to understanding the interactions between information technology‐related innovations and organizational contexts. although case study research is useful as a means of studying information systems development and use in the field, there can be practical difficulties associated with attempting to undertake case studies as a rigorous and effective method of research. this paper addresses a number of these difficulties and offers some practical guidelines for successfully completing case study research. the paper focuses on the pragmatics of conducting case study research, and draws from the discussion at a panel session conducted by the authors at the 8th australasian conference on information systems, september 1997 (acis 97), from the authors' practical experiences, and from the case study research literature.
rna-seq reveals the pan-transcriptomic impact of attenuating the gliotoxin self-protection mechanism in aspergillus fumigatus iron is essential for a wide range of cellular processes. here we show that the bzip-type regulator hapx is indispensable for the transcriptional remodeling required for adaption to iron starvation in the opportunistic fungal pathogen aspergillus fumigatus. hapx represses iron-dependent and mitochondrial-localized activities including respiration, tca cycle, amino acid metabolism, iron-sulfur-cluster and heme biosynthesis. in agreement with the impact on mitochondrial metabolism, hapx-deficiency decreases resistance to tetracycline and increases mitochondrial dna content. pathways positively affected by hapx include production of the ribotoxin aspf1 and siderophores, which are known virulence determinants. iron starvation causes a massive remodeling of the amino acid pool and hapx is essential for the coordination of the production of siderophores and their precursor ornithine. consistent with hapx-function being limited to iron depleted conditions and a. fumigatus facing iron starvation in the host, hapx-deficiency causes significant attenuation of virulence in a murine model of aspergillosis. taken together, this study demonstrates that hapx-dependent adaption to conditions of iron starvation is crucial for virulence of a. fumigatus.
relationship between insulin and hypogonadism in men with metabolic syndrome. objective low levels of testosterone in men have been shown to be associated with type 2 diabetes, visceral adiposity, dyslipidaemia and metabolic syndrome. we investigated the effect of testosterone treatment on insulin resistance and glycaemic control in hypogonadal men with type 2 diabetes.   design this was a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study in 24 hypogonadal men (10 treated with insulin) over the age of 30 years with type 2 diabetes.   methods patients were treated with i.m. testosterone 200 mg every 2 weeks or placebo for 3 months in random order, followed by a washout period of 1 month before the alternate treatment phase. the primary outcomes were changes in fasting insulin sensitivity (as measured by homeostatic model index (homa) in those not on insulin), fasting blood glucose and glycated haemoglobin. the secondary outcomes were changes in body composition, fasting lipids and blood pressure. statistical analysis was performed on the delta values, with the treatment effect of placebo compared against the treatment effect of testosterone.   results testosterone therapy reduced the homa index (-1.73 +/- 0.67, p = 0.02, n = 14), indicating an improved fasting insulin sensitivity. glycated haemoglobin was also reduced (-0.37 +/- 0.17%, p = 0.03), as was the fasting blood glucose (-1.58 +/- 0.68 mmol/l, p = 0.03). testosterone treatment resulted in a reduction in visceral adiposity as assessed by waist circumference (-1.63 +/- 0.71 cm, p = 0.03) and waist/hip ratio (-0.03 +/- 0.01, p = 0.01). total cholesterol decreased with testosterone therapy (-0.4 +/- 0.17 mmol/l, p = 0.03) but no effect on blood pressure was observed.   conclusions testosterone replacement therapy reduces insulin resistance and improves glycaemic control in hypogonadal men with type 2 diabetes. improvements in glycaemic control, insulin resistance, cholesterol and visceral adiposity together represent an overall reduction in cardiovascular risk.
expression of bacterial l-aspartate-α-decarboxylase in tobacco increases β-alanine and pantothenate levels and improves thermotolerance this work reports the characterization of transgenic tobacco (nicotiana tabacum l.) plants that constitutively overexpress nadh-gogat. three independent transformants, designated gos10, gos13 and gos19 (for gogat sense), with stable integration of the chimeric alfalfa nadh-gogat gene fused to the camv 35s promoter were studied. the transgene was stably integrated and inherited by the progeny. in these gos lines, the expression of nadh-gogat mrna and protein was detected at low levels in roots and leaves, while the expression of the host tobacco nadh-gogat gene was nearly undetectable. the roots of gos lines showed an elevated (15-40%) enzyme activity as compared to control plants. when gos plants were grown under greenhouse conditions and fed with either nitrate or ammonium as the sole nitrogen source, they showed higher total carbon and nitrogen content in shoots and increased shoot dry weight when plants were entering into the flowering stage, as compared to control plants. the observed phenotype of gos plants was interpreted as reflecting a higher capacity to assimilate nitrogen due to a higher nadh-gogat activity.
who does not participate in telehealth trials and why? a cross-sectional survey backgroundhome telehealth has the potential to benefit heart failure (hf) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) patients, however large-scale deployment is yet to be achieved.purposethe aim of this review was to assess levels of uptake of home telehealth by patients with hf and copd and the factors that determine whether patients do or do not accept and continue to use telehealth.methodsthis research performs a narrative synthesis of the results from included studies.resultsthirty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria. studies that reported rates of refusal and/or withdrawal found that almost one third of patients who were offered telehealth refused and one fifth of participants who did accept later abandoned telehealth. seven barriers to, and nine facilitators of, home telehealth use were identified.conclusionsresearch reports need to provide more details regarding telehealth refusal and abandonment, in order to understand the reasons why patients decide not to use telehealth.
patterns of care and outcomes of adjuvant radiotherapy for meningiomas: a surveillance, epidemiology, and end results and medicare linked analysis objectiveatypical meningioma (am) patients often undergo gross total resection (gtr) at the time of presentation, but subsequent prognosis and optimal management remain unclear. we sought to define the long-term recurrence rate of ams after gtr, along with factors predicting recurrence, including postoperative radiation. methodswe performed a retrospective review of 108 ams after gtr at our institution from 1993 to 2004. recurrence risk factors were analyzed using multivariate cox regression. resultsthere were 600 patient-years of imaging follow-up on 48 men and 60 women. of 108 tumors, 30 (28%) recurred 3 to 144 months after gtr (mean, 36 months). actuarial tumor recurrence rates were 7% (1 year), 41% (5 years), and 48% (10 years). of 108 patients, 8 received postoperative radiation without recurrence (p = 0.1). multivariate analysis including age, sex, postoperative radiation, tumor location, mib-1 labeling index, and 6 atypical-defining histological features identified recurrence-predicting factors: older age (hazard ratio, 1.6/decade; p = 0.01), sheeting (hazard ratio, 2.2; p = 0.025), and prominent nucleoli (hazard ratio, 2.1; p = 0.034). recursive partitioning identified a subset, men with mitoses and prominent nucleoli, with 70% recurrence (n = 14). all patients with recurrences received radiation, and 22 of 30 patients underwent craniotomies (average, 2.7 craniotomies per patient with recurrence; range, 1–7 craniotomies). only 1 of 22 re-resected meningiomas underwent malignant transformation. of 30 patients with recurrence, 10 experienced tumor-induced mortality an average of 7 years after recurrence (range, 1–14 years). conclusionafter gtr without postoperative radiation, ams have a high recurrence rate. most recurrences occurred within 5 years after resection. recurrences caused numerous reoperations per patient and shortened survival. our finding suggesting lower recurrence rates in patients undergoing immediate postoperative radiation should be investigated in larger, prospective series.
enigmatic orthology relationships between hox clusters of the african butterfly fish and other teleosts following ancient whole-genome duplication changes in ploidy occurred early in the diversification of some animal and plant lineages and represent an ongoing phenomenon in others. while the prevalence of polyploid lineages indicates that this phenomenon is a common and successful evolutionary transition, whether polyploidization itself has a significant effect on patterns and rates of diversification remains an open question. here we review evidence for the creative role of polyploidy in evolution. we present new estimates for the incidence of polyploidy in ferns and flowering plants based on a simple model describing transitions between odd and even base chromosome numbers. these new estimates indicate that ploidy changes may represent from 2 to 4% of speciation events in flowering plants and 7% in ferns. speciation via polyploidy is likely to be one of the more predominant modes of sympatric speciation in plants, owing to its potentially broad-scale effects on gene regulation and developmental processes, effects that can produce immediate shifts in morphology, breeding system, and ecological tolerances. theoretical models support the potential for increased adaptability in polyploid lineages. the evidence suggests that polyploidization can produce shifts in genetic systems and phenotypes that have the potential to result in increased evolutionary diversification, yet conclusive evidence that polyploidy has changed rates and patterns of diversification remains elusive.
a fitness cost of learning ability in drosophila melanogaster costs of resistance are widely assumed to be important in the evolution of parasite and pathogen defence in animals, but they have been demonstrated experimentally on very few occasions. endoparasitoids are insects whose larvae develop inside the bodies of other insects where they defend themselves from attack by their hosts’ immune systems (especially cellular encapsulation). working with drosophila melanogaster and its endoparasitoid leptopilina boulardi, we selected for increased resistance in four replicate populations of flies. the percentage of flies surviving attack increased from about 0.5% to between 40% and 50% in five generations, revealing substantial additive genetic variation in resistance in the field population from which our culture was established. in comparison with four control lines, flies from selected lines suffered from lower larval survival under conditions of moderate to severe intraspecific competition.
stem cell protein piwil1 endowed endometrial cancer cells with stem-like properties via inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition the rna‐binding protein musashi‐1 has been proposed to maintain stem cell function during development and regenerative processes as a modulator of the notch‐1 signaling pathway. musashi‐1 expression is upregulated in endometrial carcinoma, however, its pathogenetic role in this tumor entity is unknown. here we investigate the functional impact and mode of action of musashi‐1 on endometrial carcinoma cell behaviour in vitro. aldehyde dehydrogenase‐1 activity and side population (sp) measurement by hoechst dye exclusion revealed that the ishikawa endometrial carcinoma cell line contains a pool of putative cancer stem cells. musashi‐1 expression is 20.8‐fold upregulated in sp+ compared to sp‐ and equally distributed between aldh+ and aldh‐ cell pools. sirna‐mediated knockdown of musashi‐1 mrna expression lead to an altered expression of the signaling receptor notch‐1 and its downstream targets, the transcription factor hes‐1 and the cell cycle regulators p21waf1/cip1 and cyclin b1, as determined by western blotting and quantitative real‐time pcr. flow cytometric and elisa analyses revealed that musashi‐1‐mediated modulation of these factors exerted an antiproliferative effect on the cell cycle, and increased apoptosis in endometrial carcinoma cells. we conclude that ishikawa cells contain a subpopulation of cells with stem cell‐like properties. musashi‐1 modulates endometrial carcinoma cell cycle progression and apoptosis via the stemness‐related factors notch‐1, hes‐1 and p21waf1/cip1, thus emerging as a novel future target for endometrial carcinoma therapy.
harmonia axyridis (coleoptera: coccinellidae) in asia: a re-examination of the native range and invasion to southeastern kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan harmonia axyridis (pallas, 1773) (coleoptera: coccinellidae) is a ladybird beetle native to temperate and subtropical parts of asia. since 1916 populations of this species have been introduced throughout the world, either deliberately, or by accident through international transport. harmonia axyridis was originally released as a classical biological control agent of aphid and coccid pests in orchards and forests, but since 1994 it is also available as a commercial product for augmentative control in field and greenhouse crops. it is a very voracious and effective natural enemy of aphids, psyllids and coccids in various agricultural and horticultural habitats and forests. during the past 20 years, however, it has successfully invaded non-target habitats in north america (since 1988), europe (1999) and south america (2001) respectively in a short period of time, attacking a wide range of non-pest species in different insect orders. becoming part of the agricultural commercial pathway, it is prone to being introduced into large areas across the world by accident. we use the climex programme (v2) to predict the potential geographical distribution of h. axyridis by means of matching the climate of its region of origin with other regions in the world and taking in account biological characteristics of the species. establishment and spread seem likely in many regions across the world, including those areas which h. axyridis has already invaded (temperate europe, north america). based on the climex prediction a large part of mediterranean europe, south america, africa, australia and new zealand seem highly suitable for long-term survival of h. axyridis as well. in addition we evaluate climex as a strategic tool for estimating establishment potential as part of an environmental risk assessment procedure for biological control agents we discuss biological and ecological aspects necessary to fine-tune its establishment and spread in areas after it has been introduced.
a systematic review of rehabilitation interventions aimed at improving participation in life domains for young adults with disabilities the purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the experiences, perceptions, and needs of youth with physical disabilities in transition from adolescence to adulthood. purposeful sampling strategies were used to select 34 study participants who lived in three regions of south-central ontario, canada. data collection methods were individual and focus group interviews, and were guided by a set of open-ended questions. an editing style of analysis sorted the text into codes for description and interpretation. themes emerged about context, the transition process, needs, and services. participants identified a poor fit between young persons with disabilities and the adult world they were entering. they recommended that services be focused on environmental supports to enable them to “build their own bridges” to the adult world. community-based transition services need to be planned in collaboration with youth with disabilities and their parents. concepts of person-environment fit and health promotion can be incorporated into services to enable young persons with disabilities to experience a
sympathetic nonnoradrenergic cutaneous vasoconstriction in women is associated with reproductive hormone status. the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that regulated body temperature is decreased in the preovulatory phase in eumenorrheic women. six women were studied in both the preovulatory phase (preov-2; days 9-12), which was 1-2 days before predicted ovulation when 17beta-estradiol (e2) was estimated to peak, and in the follicular phase (f; days 2-6). the subjects walked on a treadmill ( approximately 225 w x m-2) in a warm chamber (ambient temperature = 30 degreesc; dew-point temperature = 11.5 degreesc) while heavily clothed. e2, esophageal temperature (tes), local skin temperatures, and local sweating rate were measured. the estimate of when the e2 surge would occur was correct for four of six subjects. in these four subjects, e2 increased (p </= 0.05) from 42.0 +/- 24.5 pg/ml during f to 123.2 +/- 31.3 pg/ml during preov-2. resting tes was 37.02 +/- 0.20 degreesc during f and 36.76 +/- 0.28 degreesc during preov-2 (p </= 0.05). the tes threshold for sweating was decreased (p </= 0.05) from 36.88 +/- 0.27 degreesc during f to 36. 64 +/- 0.35 degreesc during preov-2. both mean skin and mean body temperatures were decreased during rest in preov-2 group. the hypothesis that regulated body temperature is decreased during the preovulatory phase is supported.
the association between a low urine ph and the components of metabolic syndrome in the korean population: findings based on the 2010 korea national health and nutrition examination survey background low urinary ph is the commonest and by far the most important factor in uric acid nephrolithiasis but the reason(s) for this defect is (are) unknown. patients with uric acid nephrolithaisis have normal acid-base parameters according conventional clinical tests.   methods we studied steady-state plasma and urinary parameters of acid-base balance in subjects with normouricosuric pure uric acid stones. we also tested the ability of these subjects to excrete ammonium in response to an acute acid load. we compared these parameters in patients with pure uric acid stones to patients with mixed uric acid/calcium oxalate stones, pure calcium stones, and normal volunteers.   results pure uric acid stone formers have a much higher incidence of either diabetes or glucose intolerance. after equilibration to a control diet, patients with uric acid stones have lower urinary ph and they excrete less of their acid as ammonium. this is compensated by higher titratable acidity and hypocitraturia. despite their low baseline urinary ph, uric acid stone formers further acidify their urine after an acid load because of a severely impaired ammonia excretory response. their characteristics are significantly different from normal volunteers and pure calcium stone formers. patients with mixed uric acid/calcium stones exhibit intermediate characteristics.   conclusion we propose that certain patients with normouricosuric uric acid nephrolithiasis have a renal acidification disease. the primary defect lies in renal ammonium excretion, which may be linked to the insulin-resistant state. although net acid excretion is maintained at the expense of increased titratable acidity and to some degree hypocitraturia, the compromise is acid urine ph and may result in uric acid nephrolithiasis.
targeting adenoviral vectors for enhanced gene therapy of uterine leiomyomas. in vivo cancer gene therapy approaches for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (scchn) based on adenoviral vector-mediated gene delivery have been limited by the suboptimal efficacy of gene transfer to tumor cells. we hypothesized that this issue was due to deficiency of the primary adenoviral receptor, the coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (car), on the tumor targets. studies of car levels on scchn cell lines confirmed that their relative refractoriness to the adenoviral vector was based on this deficiency. to circumvent this deficiency, we applied an adenoviral vector targeted to a tumor cell marker characteristic of scchn. in this regard, integrins of the alpha2beta1 and alpha3beta1 class are frequently overexpressed in scchn. furthermore, these integrins recognize the rgd peptide motif. on this basis, we applied an adenoviral vector genetically modified to contain such a peptide within the hi loop of the fiber protein as a means to alter viral tropism. studies confirmed that the car-independent gene delivery achieved via this strategy allowed enhanced gene transfer efficiencies to scchn tumor cells. importantly, this strategy could achieve preferential augmentation of gene transfer in tumor cells compared with normal cells. the ability to achieve enhanced and specific gene transfer to tumor cells via adenoviral vectors has important implications for gene therapy strategies for scchn and for other neoplasms in general.
q-sea – a tool for quality assessment of ethics analyses conducted as part of health technology assessments objectives although consideration of ethical issues is recognized as a crucial part of health technology assessment, ethics analysis for hta is generally perceived as methodologically underdeveloped in comparison to other hta domains. the aim of our study is (i) to verify existing tools for quality assessment of ethics analyses for hta, (ii) to consider some arguments for and against the need for quality assessment tools for ethics analyses for hta, and (iii) to propose a preliminary set of criteria that could be used for assessing the quality of ethics analyses for hta.   methods we systematically reviewed the literature, reviewed hta organizations' web sites, and solicited views from thirty-two experts in the field of ethics for hta.   results the database and hta agency web site searches yielded 420 references (413 from databases, seven from hta web sites). no formal instruments for assessing the quality of ethics analyses for hta purposes were identified. thirty-two experts in the field of ethics for hta from ten countries, who were brought together at two workshops held in edmonton (canada) and cologne (germany) confirmed the findings from the literature.   conclusions generating a quality assessment tool for ethics analyses in hta would confer considerable benefits, including methodological alignment with other areas of hta, increase in transparency and transferability of ethics analyses, and provision of common language between the various participants in the hta process. we propose key characteristics of quality assessment tools for this purpose, which can be applied to ethics analyses for hta purposes.
predicting therapeutic response in patients with heart failure: the story of c-reactive protein the circulating acute phase reactant c-reactive protein (crp) has traditionally been characterized as an effector of nonclonal host resistance since it activates the classical complement cascade and mediates phagocytosis, but it is also capable of regulating inflammation. the three-dimensional structure of human crp has revealed the molecular basis for complement activation and binding of phosphate monoesters. crp gene expression by liver hepatocytes in response to cytokines (il-1β and il-6) released in tissues requires several transcription factors which interact. elevated levels of crp are a prognostic marker for coronary artery disease; however, the role of crp in atheriosclerosis remains unknown. crp also mediates direct host protection to some microbial pathogens via its opsonic activity through certain fcγ-receptors. the crp response may be one of the links between nonspecific innate immunity and specific clonal immunity.
music , noise exclusion , and learning disabilities an extensive corticofugal system extends from the auditory cortex toward subcortical nuclei along the auditory pathway. corticofugal influences reach even into the inner ear via the efferents of the olivocochlear bundle, the medial branch of which modulates preneural sound amplification gain. this corticofugal system is thought to contribute to neuroplasticity underlying auditory perceptual learning. in the present study, we investigated the involvement of the medial olivocochlear bundle (mocb) in perceptual learning as a result of auditory training. mocb activity was monitored in normal-hearing adult listeners during a 5 d training regimen on a consonant–vowel phoneme-in-noise discrimination task. the results show significant group learning, with great inter-individual variability in initial performance and improvement. as observed in previous auditory training studies, poor initial performers tended to show greater learning. strikingly, mocb activity measured on the first training day strongly predicted the subsequent amount of improvement, such that weaker initial mocb activity was associated with greater improvement. moreover, in listeners that improved significantly, an increase in mocb activity was observed after training. thus, as discrimination thresholds of listeners converged over the course of training, differences in mocb activity between listeners decreased. additional analysis showed that mocb activity did not explain variation in performance between listeners on any training day but rather reflected an individual listener's performance relative to their personal optimal range. the findings suggest an mocb-mediated listening strategy that facilitates speech-in-noise perception. the operation of this strategy is flexible and susceptible to training, presumably because of task-related adaptation of descending control from the cortex.
synthesis, antimicrobial, and computational evaluation of novel isobutylchalcones as antimicrobial agents the novel benzimidazole derivatives (3, 5, 8, 9, 12-14, 18-41) were prepared in this paper and the antimicrobial activities of these compounds against staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa, standard and clinical isolates), bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli and candida albicans were evaluated. compounds 24-26 which have no substitution of n-1 position displayed better antibacterial activities than those of standards (ciprofloxacin, ampicillin and sultamicillin) against both the drug-resistant bacteria (mrsa, standard and clinical isolates). these derivatives (24-26), 2,5,6-trihalogenobenzimidazole analogues (8, 12), 5,6-dichloro-2-amino derivative (13), and 5-chloro-2-(4-benzyloxyphenyl)benzimidazole (35) exhibited the most potent antibacterial activity with mic 3.12 microg/ml against s. aureus.
towards a framework of digital platform competition: a comparative study of monopolistic & federated mobile payment platforms i this essay, we argue that pervasive digitization gives birth to a new type of product architecture: the layered modular architecture. the layered modular architecture extends the modular architecture of physical products by incorporating four loosely coupled layers of devices, networks, services, and contents created by digital technology. we posit that this new architecture instigates profound changes in the ways that firms organize for innovation in the future. we develop (1) a conceptual framework to describe the emerging organizing logic of digital innovation and (2) an information systems research agenda for digital strategy and the creation and management of corporate information technology infrastructures.

orphanin fq/nociceptin-mediated desensitization of opioid receptor-like 1 receptor and μ opioid receptors involves protein kinase c: a molecular mechanism for heterologous cross-talk a heptadecapeptide was identified and purified from porcine brain tissue as a ligand for an orphan heterotrimeric gtp- binding protein (g protein)- coupled receptor (lc132) that is similar in sequence to opioid receptors. this peptide, orphanin fq, has a primary structure reminiscent of that of opioid peptides. nanomolar concentrations of orphanin fq inhibited forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in cells transfected with lc132. this inhibitory activity was not affected by the addition of opioid ligands, nor did the peptide activate opioid receptors. orphanin fq bound to its receptor in a saturable manner and with high affinity. when injected intracerebroventricularly into mice, orphanin fq caused a decrease in locomotor activity but did not induce analgesia in the hot-plate test. however, the peptide produced hyperalgesia in the tail-flick assay. thus, orphanin fq may act as a transmitter in the brain by modulating nociceptive and locomotor behavior.
multilayer scaffolds in orthopaedic tissue engineering background the management and treatment of bone defects caused by trauma, non-union, tumors and disease poses a major clinical problem. limitations with autograft and allograft have led to research into tissue engineering of bone graft using scaffolds and mesenchymal stem cells.   objectives this systematic review aims to examine and summarize the pre clinical in-vivo studies and the limited clinical studies on the use of scaffolds in the treatment of critical size bony defects.   data sources databases: pubmed, medline, ovid, scopus and cochrane library. the following key words and search terms were used: scaffolds, bone repair, bone regeneration, mesenchymal stem cells, and tissue engineering and musculo skeletal.   methods a total of 503 articles were reviewed. 23 articles were identified as relevant for the purpose of this systematic literature review.   results three tables of studies were constructed: pre clinical biological scaffolds, pre clinical synthetic scaffolds and clinical scaffolds.   conclusions there is a lot of pre clinical evidence that the use of scaffold combined with mesenchymal stem cells enhances osteogenesis when treating bone defects. there is limited clinical evidence at this early stage that scaffolds can be used safely and effectively in tissue engineered grafts to repair bone defects with no rcts as yet having been conducted.the limited clinical series reported have however produced promising results.
isoqol recommends minimum standards for patient-reported outcome measures used in patient-centered outcomes and comparative effectiveness research objective the objective of this review is to summarize recommendations on methods for evaluating responsiveness and minimal important difference (mid) for patient-reported outcome (pro) measures.   study design and setting we review, summarize, and integrate information on issues and methods for evaluating responsiveness and determining mid estimates for pro measures. recommendations are made on best-practice methods for evaluating responsiveness and mid.   results the mid for a pro instrument is not an immutable characteristic, but may vary by population and context, and no one mid may be valid for all study applications. mid estimates should be based on multiple approaches and triangulation of methods. anchor-based methods applying various relevant patient-rated, clinician-rated, and disease-specific variables provide primary and meaningful estimates of an instrument's mid. results for the pro measures from clinical trials can also provide insight into observed effects based on treatment comparisons and should be used to help determine mid. distribution-based methods can support estimates from anchor-based approaches and can be used in situations where anchor-based estimates are unavailable.   conclusion we recommend that the mid is based primarily on relevant patient-based and clinical anchors, with clinical trial experience used to further inform understanding of mid.
recombinant protein containing b-cell epitopes of different loxosceles spider toxins generates neutralizing antibodies in immunized rabbits loxoscelism is a necrotic-hemolytic syndrome caused by bites of brown spiders belonging to the genus loxosceles. many approaches for the treatment of loxosceles poisoning have already been proposed, among which administration of specific antivenom is thought to be the more specific. we have evaluated the use of peptides as immunogen to raise in rabbits an antibody response that could protect animals from a challenge by the loxtox isoform lid1, one of the main toxic component of loxosceles intermedia venom. six antigenic regions of lid1 were mapped by using the spot method. the corresponding peptides were further chemically synthesized, mixed, and used as immunogens in rabbits. control animal received recombinant lid1 alone or together with peptides. we found that the rabbit antibody response to peptides was cross-reactive with lid1, although only one peptide from the mix of six was immunogenic. the dermonecrotic, hemorrhagic and oedema forming activities induced by lid1 in naïve rabbits were inhibited by 82%, 35% and 35% respectively, by preincubation of lid1 with anti-peptide antibodies prepared from immunized rabbits. animals that were immunized with peptides or lid1r, were found to be protected from the dermonecrotic, hemorrhagic and oedema forming activities induced by a challenge with lid1. the protection conferred by peptides was, however, lower than that provided by the peptide protein combination or by the full-length protein. these results encourage us in the utilization of synthetic peptides for therapeutic serum development or vaccination approaches.
comparison of online survey recruitment platforms for hard-to-reach pregnant smoking populations: feasibility study introduction behavioral support aids smoking cessation in pregnancy. however, it remains unclear which component behavior change techniques (bcts) contribute to effectiveness or the extent to which these are applied in practice. this study aimed to examine (a) which bcts were included in effective behavioral support interventions for pregnant smokers (b) the prevalence of use of these bcts by the english stop smoking services (ssss).   methods from a cochrane review of smoking cessation behavioral support in pregnancy, 7 interventions were identified as effective in that they increased the odds of cessation by at least 50%, and differences between intervention and control conditions were statistically significant. bcts in each intervention were identified using an established taxonomy of bcts. thirteen treatment manuals from ssss were coded for inclusion of bcts.   results thirty-seven bcts were identified across trials of behavioral support for pregnant smokers, with an average of 8 bcts, and a range of 6-34 bcts, per intervention. eleven bcts were present in at least 2 effective interventions (e.g., facilitate goal setting [n = 6], advise on social support [n = 2], action planning [n = 5], provide rewards contingent on successfully stopping smoking [n = 4]). only 15.4% of treatment manuals from ssss contained all 11 bcts; 53.8% contained at least 6 of them.   conclusions while bcts associated with effective interventions can be identified from systematically reviewed literature, english ssss appear to use only a limited proportion of these in practice.
predictors of postprandial hypotension in elderly patients with de novo parkinson’s disease postprandial hypotension was first recognized as a clinical problem in 1977 in a patient with parkinson disease [1]. however, the hypotensive effect of meal ingestion has been appreciated for a longer time. in 1935, gladstone [2] described a hypertensive patient who had had a postprandial decrease in blood pressure from 185/120 mm hg to 145/80 mm hg. in 1953, smirk [3] observed a decrease in blood pressure after patients with autonomic failure ingested food. robertson and colleagues [4] confirmed these results in patients with chronic autonomic failure and found an average decrease in systolic blood pressure of 49 6 mm hg after a meal [4]. since lipsitz and colleagues [5] first described it in nursing home residents a decade ago, postprandial hypotension has become recognized as a common disorder of blood pressure regulation in the elderly [5]. our current understanding of postprandial hypotension is limited by the lack of a standardized, clinically meaningful definition. analogous to orthostatic hypotension, postprandial hypotension is commonly defined in the literature as a decrease in systolic blood pressure of 20 mm hg or more within 2 hours of the start of a meal. postprandial hypotension also develops when the absolute level of systolic blood pressure after a meal decreases to less than 90 mm hg and when the systolic blood pressure before a meal is greater than 100 mm hg. in addition, if a meal-related decrease in systolic blood pressure exceeds the threshold for cerebral autoregulation, patients may become symptomatic when the absolute systolic blood pressure level exceeds 90 mm hg or when the postprandial systolic blood pressure decreases to less than 20 mm hg. the frequent absence of symptoms associated with this decrease in blood pressure after meal ingestion makes the value of this definition uncertain. in addition, the morbidity and mortality related to postprandial hypotension are unknown. a potential cumulative effect of multiple hypotensive stresses, such as posture change or administration of medication at the time of meal ingestion, makes assessment of the clinical relevance of individual blood pressure responses to a meal even more difficult. although it can be exacerbated by posture change, postprandial hypotension is a distinct entity that differs from orthostatic hypotension. we have reviewed the current knowledge of the epidemiology, clinical symptoms and significance, pathophysiology, and management of postprandial hypotension. we hope to make the practicing physician more aware of this common abnormality in blood pressure regulation and to stimulate new research of its mechanisms and management. methods through a medline search, we identified all articles on postprandial hypertension published between 1966 and 1994. we also used the bibliographies of relevant articles. all articles and case reports describing meal-related hypotension in the elderly and in patients with autonomic failure were included for analysis. epidemiology and associated conditions during the past decade, hypotension in response to ingestion of a mixed meal or oral glucose has been shown in healthy elderly persons [6-14]; young and elderly persons with hypertension [10, 15-21]; elderly patients in nursing homes [5, 22-25]; and patients with postprandial syncope [26, 27], autonomic insufficiency [4, 28-36], parkinson disease [1, 37-39], paraplegia [40], diabetes mellitus [28, 38, 41], cardiovascular disease [42, 43], and renal failure treated with hemodialysis [44, 45]. however, the epidemiology of postprandial hypotension has not been thoroughly studied. mild, meal-induced decreases in blood pressure are common in healthy older persons [6-11], but the prevalence of these decreases is unknown. the presence of multiple illnesses in elderly persons may further impair cardiovascular adaptation to meal ingestion and result in marked postprandial decreases in blood pressure. investigations of elderly persons living in nursing homes have shown that nearly all persons experience some decrease in blood pressure [24, 25]. in 24% to 36% of these patients, systolic blood pressure decreases more than 20 mm hg within 75 minutes of eating a meal [24, 25]. it has been difficult to dissociate the effects of physiologic aging on postprandial blood pressure regulation from those of age-associated illnesses. the elevation in blood pressure associated with aging can profoundly influence postprandial blood pressure. in a study of 82 healthy persons aged 19 to 79 years, meal-related reductions in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly correlated. however, when the data were corrected for baseline blood pressure, this correlation was no longer seen [46]. older hypertensive persons have greater reductions in blood pressure after ingesting food or oral glucose than do age-matched normotensive persons [7, 9, 10, 17-20]. postprandial decreases in systolic blood pressure ranging from 17 to 25 mm hg have been found in hypertensive elderly patients older than age 65 years who did not have other overt cardiovascular diseases [9, 10, 17, 18]. in these patients, diastolic blood pressure may decrease as much as 15 mm hg. however, because hypertensive middle-aged and young persons also have postprandial decreases in blood pressure [10, 16], this phenomenon may be primarily caused by blood pressure elevation rather than by aging itself. profound postprandial hypotension has been observed in patients with autonomic failure [1, 4, 28-36, 47, 48]. the first case report described a 65-year-old man who had dizziness and visual disturbance associated with large decreases in blood pressure after almost every meal [1]. robertson and colleagues [4] found a marked postprandial decrease in sitting systolic blood pressure (range, 22 to 98 mm hg) in 10 patients with autonomic failure. hoeldtke and associates [28, 47] studied patients with multiple-system atrophy (the shy-drager syndrome) and pure autonomic failure and found that the decrease in the mean sitting postprandial arterial blood pressure ranged from 62 to 83 mm hg [28, 47]. all of these patients had blurred vision and dizziness after the meal [47]. postprandial hypotension is also commonly found in patients with peripheral neuropathy caused by diabetes mellitus or other disorders [28, 33, 38, 41] as well as by parkinson disease [1, 37-39]. hypotension is a common side effect of antiparkinsonian drugs such as levodopa. in patients with renal failure, symptomatic postprandial hypotension has been seen during hemodialysis [44, 45]. this appears to be relevant primarily in uremic patients who have autonomic dysfunction. determining the prevalence and clinical implications of postprandial hypotension is complicated not only by different diseases and drugs in the populations studied but also by methodologic inconsistencies among studies. first, the body's position while the meal is being consumed probably affects food-induced changes in blood pressure. postprandial hypotension occurs both in the sitting and supine positions. although the sitting position is more physiologic, orthostatic changes in blood pressure during prolonged sitting might contribute to the postprandial decrease in blood pressure. second, no studies have addressed the variability of postprandial blood pressure. previous studies have shown that orthostatic blood pressure measurements in the elderly vary considerably from day to day [49]. this could also be true for postprandial hypotension. third, the nutrient composition of meals affects the magnitude of the decrease in postprandial blood pressure [12, 13, 15, 50]. carbohydrates and, more specifically, glucose have been found to play a significant role [10, 29]. however, conflicting data have been reported about the influence of fat or protein on postprandial blood pressure [12, 13, 15, 51, 52]. fourth, postprandial hypotension depends on the temperature of the meal [53]. after cold glucose solutions are ingested, blood pressure remains unchanged, whereas glucose solutions served warm or at room temperature cause a decrease in blood pressure. finally, the time at which blood pressure is measured after a meal may influence the detection of this phenomenon. postprandial hypotension can be found at all meal times [14] and is almost immediately apparent after a meal. blood pressure usually reaches a nadir within 30 to 60 minutes. in nursing home residents, the systolic blood pressure nadir occurred as early as 15 minutes after the meal in 13% to 17% of the patients and as late as 75 minutes after the meal in 11% to 13% of the patients [24, 25]. clinical symptoms and significance in elderly persons or patients with autonomic failure, postprandial reductions in blood pressure may result in syncope, falls, angina pectoris, weakness, dizziness, nausea, lightheadedness, or black spots in the visual field [1, 5, 22, 24-26, 29, 39, 46] (table 1). in addition, case reports have described elderly patients with large postprandial reductions in blood pressure who developed angina pectoris or transient ischemic attacks that resolved as blood pressure returned to normal [24, 54]. however, data on the frequency of postprandial hypotension and its potential symptoms are scarce. in one recent study, half of a group of patients with unexplained syncope had postprandial hypotension [27]. table 1. clinical symptoms associated with postprandial hypotension the cerebral symptoms probably depend on the extent to which cerebral perfusion is compromised. accumulation of age- and disease-related conditions that threaten cerebral blood flow or reduce oxygen content in the blood may bring cerebral oxygen delivery near the threshold needed to maintain consciousness [55]. therefore, even small changes in blood pressure may reduce cerebral oxygen delivery to below the critical threshold and thus result in ischemic symptoms. the potential for postprandial cerebral ischemia may be greater in elderly p
derlin-1 regulates mutant vcp-linked pathogenesis and endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis elimination of misfolded proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (er) by retro-translocation is an important physiological adaptation to er stress. this process requires recognition of a substrate in the er lumen and its subsequent movement through the membrane by the cytosolic p97 atpase. here we identify a p97-interacting membrane protein complex in the mammalian er that links these two events. the central component of the complex, derlin-1, is a homologue of der1, a yeast protein whose inactivation prevents the elimination of misfolded luminal er proteins. derlin-1 associates with different substrates as they move through the membrane, and inactivation of derlin-1 in c. elegans causes er stress. derlin-1 interacts with us11, a virally encoded er protein that specifically targets mhc class i heavy chains for export from the er, as well as with vimp, a novel membrane protein that recruits the p97 atpase and its cofactor.
malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor presenting with hemoperitoneum in puerperium: report of a case with review of the literature background: malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors (m-gist) are rare mesenchymal tumors originating in the wall of the gastrointestinal (gi) tract. previous studies have included limited numbers of patients, and most included malignant and benign cases from throughout the gi tract. we reviewed the experience of a single tertiary cancer care center with m-gist of the small intestine only.methods: a prospective database identified all patients seen from 1989 to 1998. clinical and pathological data, treatment, and outcome were analyzed. overall median follow-up time was 24 months (range, 1-176 months).results: fifty patients (31 male, 19 female) were identified. mean age at diagnosis was 55 years. disease was localized in 11 patients, locally advanced (invasion into adjacent organs/peritoneum) in 24 patients, perforated in 4 patients, multiple primary lesions in 2 patients, and distant metastases in 9 patients. all patients underwent resection, which was complete in 70%. locoregional recurrence (lr) developed in 43% (median, 25 months), and distant metastases in 59% (median, 21 months) of patients at risk. at last follow-up, 14 patients were alive (6 disease-free), 2 had died disease-free, and 34 died with recurrent disease. overall survival (os) was similar for localized and locally advanced disease; os also was similar for patients with multiple primaries and distant metastases at diagnosis. patients were grouped into three stages: (i) patients with localized and locally advanced disease; (ii) patients with perforated; and (iii) patients with multiple primaries and distant metastases. actuarial os at 5 years was 41% (n = 50)—42% for those with complete resection and 8% for incomplete resection. univariable analysis showed that earlier stage at diagnosis (p = .001) and completeness of resection (p = .004) predicted for longer os.conclusions: most patients with m-gist of the small intestine relapse following resection, but survival may be prolonged. in univariable analysis, stage at presentation and complete resection were significant prognostic variables for os; grade was not significant. localized and locally advanced m-gist of the small intestine have a mean os > 5 years. complete resection should be the goal of initial surgical treatment.
increased brain iron coincides with early plaque formation in a mouse model of alzheimer's disease objective: to determine whether changes in brain biometals in alzheimer disease (ad) and in normal brain tissue are tandemly associated with amyloid β-peptide (aβ) burden and dementia severity. methods: the authors measured zinc, copper, iron, manganese, and aluminum and aβ levels in postmortem neocortical tissue from patients with ad (n = 10), normal age-matched control subjects (n = 14), patients with schizophrenia (n = 26), and patients with schizophrenia with amyloid (n = 8). severity of cognitive impairment was assessed with the clinical dementia rating scale (cdr). results: there was a significant, more than twofold, increase of tissue zinc in the ad-affected cortex compared with the other groups. zinc levels increased with tissue amyloid levels. zinc levels were significantly elevated in the most severely demented cases (cdr 4 to 5) and in cases that had an amyloid burden greater than 8 plaques/mm2. levels of other metals did not differ between groups. conclusions: brain zinc accumulation is a prominent feature of advanced alzheimer disease (ad) and is biochemically linked to brain amyloid β-peptide accumulation and dementia severity in ad.
maternal treatment with dexamethasone during gestation alters sexual development markers in the f1 and f2 male offspring of wistar rats. unlabelled we studied the effects of chronic renal failure on the pituitary-cortisol axis and adrenal androgen function in 26 patients (16 male and 10 female), aged 6.5 to 22.5 years (mean 14.5). ten patients were prepubertal, 8 pubertal, and 8 post-pubertal. all of them were on chronic hemodialysis. pubic hair development was delayed in 56% of the patients. serum cortisol was increased in 15 out of the 26 patients. serum delta 4-androstenedione was high in 11 out of 15 patients in tanner's stage i or ii and in 1 out of 11 patients in tanner's stage iii, iv or v (p less than 0.01). serum cortisol was elevated in 10 out of 12 patients with high serum delta 4-androstenedione and in only 5 out of 14 with normal delta 4-androstenedione (p less than 0.02). serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate was normal in 22 patients and elevated in 4 males. there was a significant inverse correlation between bone age and serum cortisol (r: -0.59; p less than 0.005) and a significant positive correlation between bone age and serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (r: 0.45 p less than 0.01). serum acth was normal. a reduction by 50% in cortisol and 78% in dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate was found after dexamethasone suppression, but delta 4-androstenedione did not suppress after dexamethasone. after acth stimulation test cortisol increased by 50% and delta 4-androstenedione by 80%.   conclusions the increased levels of cortisol and delta 4-androstenedione with partial resistance to dexamethasone suggest that these patients have a hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction similar to that found in cushing's disease or in chronic stress. the difference in the responses of delta 4-androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate observed is consistent with the existence of different mechanisms of control for these two steroids.
alteration of sphingolipid metabolism as a putative mechanism underlying lps‐induced bbb disruption rat brain increases in weight after birth in three stages: (i) rapidly for the first 2 weeks, (ii) at a lower rate from 2 to 5 weeks, and (iii) at a still lower rate from 5 weeks to 5 months. during the succeeding period, designated iv, it maintains constant weight up to 1 year of age. brain ganglioside content increased linearly during i and ii, more slowly during iii, and diminished during iv. the appearance of measurable amounts of brain sphingomyelin and cerebroside succeeded that of ganglioside. ceramide with c18-sphingosine and c18 fatty acid was found in a large proportion of all three sphingolipids upon their first appearance in measurable quantity. c18 fatty acid in cerebroside rapidly declined to a negligible level, while in gangliosides and sphingomyelin it declined slowly but remained the major fatty acid component. cerebrosides and sphingomyelin contained c18-sphingosine almost exclusively at all stages of rat brain growth. gangliosides contained c18-sphingosine almost exclusively at birth, but subsequently accumulated c20-sphingosine until they had nearly equal quantities of each base type. changes in human brain gangliosides resemble those in rat. in tay-sachs disease, gangliosides have c18-sphingosine predominantly, and a high content of c18 fatty acid.
spatial and temporal variations of heavy metals in surface sediments in bohai bay, north china mollusks living in seas can accumulate heavy metals, and may serve as excellent passive biomonitors. during a period of 1 year, bioaccumulation of as, cd, co, cr, cu, fe, hg, mn, ni, pb, se, and zn was examined in nine kinds of mollusks (rapana venosa, neverita didyma, scapharca subcrenata, mytilus edulis, amusium, crassostrea talienwhanensis, meretix meretrix, ruditapes philippinarum, and mactra veneriformis), which were collected at eight coastal sites along the chinese bohai sea. metal concentrations were directly determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (icp-ms). two certified reference materials, dogfish muscle (dorm-2) and mussel (gbw 08571), were used to validate the methods, and the recoveries were within 83.72-112.30% of the certified values. bioaccumulation of metals varied strongly among sampling sites and species. statistical analysis (one-way anova) indicated that different species examined showed different bioaccumulation of metals, and perhaps they could be used as potential biomonitors to investigate the contamination levels of heavy metals. principal component analysis (pca) and correlation analysis were used to study the relationships between these heavy metals. the results showed that, in nine mollusks' tissues, there are significant correlations between these elements in adjacent main group or subgroup in periodic table of elements.
use of health information technology to advance evidence-based care: lessons from the va queri program objectives to document and assess the experiences of 104 agency for healthcare research and quality (ahrq)-funded health information technology (health it) grantees in planning and implementing health it systems.   data source grant proposals and interviews with the ahrq health it grantees.   data collection method extracted descriptive data from the health it grant proposals; conducted telephone interviews with principal investigators.   principal findings ahrq funding of the health it projects provided important support for health it development work in various health care settings. successful implementation required commitment from top management, dedicated staff and financial resources, an open process to encourage buy-in and enthusiasm by end users, and sheer persistence. technologies required tailoring to the specific organization's needs. grantees felt their projects could be replicated by others, if organizations had ample it expertise and resources. evaluating the value of health it was hampered by the absence of validated instruments and measures, organizational demands that competed with data collection, and lack of evaluation expertise among health it implementers.   conclusions experiences of the health it grantees provide rich information for use by health care providers, ahrq, and other policy makers to help strengthen future health it development efforts, including the need to improve evaluation design and standards to assess impact.
granule cell dispersion in temporal lobe epilepsy is associated with changes in dendritic orientation and spine distribution the distribution of granule cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation was studied in control autopsy and temporal lobe epilepsy (tle) specimens. in control tissue, the granule cell somata were closely approximated and formed a narrow lamina with a distinct, regular border with the molecular layer. in 11 of 15 tle specimens, the granule cell somata were dispersed and formed a wider than normal granule cell layer. the granule cell somata extended into the molecular layer to varying extents, creating an irregular boundary between the lamina. the dispersed granule cells were frequently aligned in columns, and many of these neurons displayed elongated bipolar forms. the extent of granule cell dispersion appeared to be related to the amount of cell loss in the polymorph layer of the dentate gyrus. granule cell dispersion was not consistently associated with granule cell loss although 5 of the 11 specimens with granule cell dispersion also showed moderate to marked granule cell loss. the most common features in the histories of the tle cases with granule cell dispersion were severe febrile seizures or seizures associated with meningitis or encephalitis during the first 4 years of life. the dispersion of the granule cells suggests that there has been some alteration in the patterns of cell migration in a subpopulation of cases with severe tle. the resultant ectopic positions of the granule cells could lead to changes in both the afferent and efferent connections of these neurons and, thus, contribute to the altered circuitry of the hippocampal formation in tle.
transcriptome adaptation of the bovine mammary gland to diets rich in unsaturated fatty acids shows greater impact of linseed oil over safflower oil on gene expression and metabolic pathways backgroundbovine milk fat composition is responsive to dietary manipulation providing an avenue to modify the content of fatty acids and especially some specific unsaturated fatty acid (usfa) isomers of benefit to human health. micrornas (mirnas) regulate gene expression but their specific roles in bovine mammary gland lipogenesis are unclear. the objective of this study was to determine the expression pattern of mirnas following mammary gland adaptation to dietary supplementation with 5 % linseed or safflower oil using next generation rna-sequencing.methodstwenty-four canadian holstein dairy cows (twelve per treatment) in mid lactation were fed a control diet (total mixed ration of corn:grass silages) for 28 days followed by a treatment period (control diet supplemented with 5 % linseed or safflower oil) of 28 days. milk samples were collected weekly for fat and individual fatty acid determination. rna from mammary gland biopsies harvested on day-14 (control period) and on days +7 and +28 (treatment period) from six randomly selected cows per treatment was subjected to small rna sequencing.resultsmilk fat percentage decreased significantly (p < 0.001) during treatment with the two diets as compared to the control period. the individual saturated fatty acids c4:0, c6:0, c8:0, c14:0 and c16:0 decreased significantly (p < 0.05) while five usfas (c14:1, c18:1n11t, c20:3n3, c20:5n3 and cla:t10c12) increased remarkably (p < 0.05) in response to both treatments. analysis of 361 million sequence reads generated 321 known bovine mirnas and 176 novel mirnas. the expression of fourteen and twenty-two mirnas was affected (p < 0.05) by linseed and safflower oil treatments, respectively. seven mirnas including six up-regulated (bta-mir-199c, mir-199a-3p, mir-98, mir-378, mir-148b and mir-21-5p) and one down-regulated (bta-mir-200a) were found to be regulated (p < 0.05) by both treatments, and thus considered core differentially expressed (de) mirnas. the gene targets of core de mirnas have functions related to gene expression and general cellular metabolism (p < 0.05) and are enriched in four pathways of lipid metabolism (3-phosphoinositide biosynthesis, 3-phosphoinositide degradation, d-myo-inisitol-5-phosphate metabolism and the superpathway of inositol phosphate compounds).conclusionour results suggest that de mirnas in this study might be important regulators of bovine mammary lipogenesis and metabolism. the novel mirnas identified in this study will further enrich the bovine mirnome repertoire and contribute to understanding mammary gland biology.
functional characterization of two alternatively spliced transcripts of tomato abscisic acid insensitive3 (abi3) gene the arabidopsisgene abi3 shows developmentally regulated alternative splicing. abi3-α and abi3-β splice variants encode full-length and truncated abi3 proteins, respectively. the conserved splicing factor sua reduces splicing of a cryptic abi3 intron, which leads to the accumulation of abi3-α. mutations in sua suppress the frameshift mutant abi3-5 by restoring its reading frame. abscisic acid insensitive3 (abi3) is a major regulator of seed maturation in arabidopsis thaliana. we detected two abi3 transcripts, abi3-α and abi3-β, which encode full-length and truncated proteins, respectively. alternative splicing of abi3 is developmentally regulated, and the abi3-β transcript accumulates at the end of seed maturation. the two abi3 transcripts differ by the presence of a cryptic intron in abi3-α, which is spliced out in abi3-β. the suppressor of abi3-5 (sua) mutant consistently restores wild-type seed features in the frameshift mutant abi3-5 but does not suppress other abi3 mutant alleles. sua is a conserved splicing factor, homologous to the human protein rbm5, and reduces splicing of the cryptic abi3 intron, leading to a decrease in abi3-β transcript. in the abi3-5 mutant, abi3-β codes for a functional abi3 protein due to frameshift restoration.
finite element modeling of short-wavelength folding on venus: implications for the plume hypothesis for crustal plateau formation crustal plateaus on venus constitute one of that planet’s most intriguing tectonic features. they host so-called “tessera” terrain, or deformed crust exhibiting two or more sets of intersecting tectonic lineaments, which comprises»8% of venus’ surface. major questions surrounding crustal plateaus and tessera terrain include: (1) what is the nature of crustal plateau deformation? what structures are present, and what are their spatial and temporal relations? (2) what is the global distribution of tessera terrain? does it form a global layer under the regional plains, cropping out in crustal plateaus, or is it confined to crustal plateaus? and (3) what are the implications of (1) and (2) for understanding the processes responsible for formation and deformation of crustal plateaus? structural and kinematic analyses reveal that deformation at ovda regio, venus largest crustal plateau, is characterized by linear shallow steep-sided troughs (ribbons), long arcuate long-wavelength folds, short mid-wavelength folds, and wide complex graben. temporal relations between structures lead to a three-phase regional strain history consisting of (1) layer-normal flattening of a thin competent membrane resulting in radially oriented, distributed extension (ribbon formation); (2) modest contraction of a thicker layer (concentric folding at plateau margins, interference folding in the plateau interior); and (3) limited extension localized at fold crests (graben formation). wavelength analysis of ribbons and folds places limits on the thickness of the competent layer during each stage of deformation and reflects an early shallow brittle‐ductile transition (bdt) that deepened with time. ovda’s deformation, topography, and gravity are all spatially correlated, strongly suggesting a genetic relationship between surface deformation and processes causing crustal thickening and plateau uplift. thus tessera terrain at ovda regio is likely confined to the topographically high plateau and does not extend beneath the surrounding regional plains. similar patterns persist at other crustal plateaus, indicating that tessera terrain is in general confined to crustal plateaus and does not form a globally continuous layer. ovda’s structures, their spatial and temporal relations, the resulting strain history, and the behavior of the bdt through time support a model of mantle plume upwelling in a thin lithospheric regime for crustal plateau formation and contradict previous downwelling models. similarities between structural and kinematic trends at ovda regio and other crustal plateaus lend support to this idea. c ∞ 1999 academic press
comparison of dilution, filtration, and microwave digestion sample pretreatments in elemental profiling of wine by icp-ms the analysis of wine is of great importance since wine components strongly determine its stability, organoleptic or nutrition characteristics. in addition, wine analysis is also important to prevent fraud and to assess toxicological issues. among the different analytical techniques described in the literature, atomic spectrometry has been traditionally employed for elemental wine analysis due to its simplicity and good analytical figures of merit. the scope of this review is to summarize the main advantages and drawbacks of various atomic spectrometry techniques for elemental wine analysis. special attention is paid to interferences (i.e. matrix effects) affecting the analysis as well as the strategies available to mitigate them. finally, latest studies about wine speciation are briefly discussed.
design automation and test solutions for digital microfluidic biochips microfluidics-based biochips are soon expected to revolutionize clinical diagnosis, dna sequencing, and other laboratory procedures involving molecular biology. most microfluidic biochips today are based on the principle of continuous fluid flow and they rely on permanently etched microchannels, micropumps, and microvalves. we focus here on the automated design of “digital” droplet-based microfluidic biochips. in contrast to conventional continuous-flow systems, digital microfluidics offers dynamic reconfigurability; groups of cells in a microfluidics array can be reconfigured to change their functionality during the concurrent execution of a set of bioassays. we present a simulated annealing-based technique for module placement in such biochips. the placement procedure not only addresses chip area, but also considers fault tolerance, which allows a microfluidic module to be relocated elsewhere in the system when a single cell is detected to be faulty. simulation results are presented for case studies involving the polymerase chain reaction and multiplexed in vitro clinical diagnostics.
noscapine recirculates enterohepatically and induces self-clearance. abstract noscapine, a phthalideisoquinoline alkaloid derived from opium, has been used as an oral anti-tussive agent and has shown very few toxic effects in animals or humans. recently, we reported that noscapine binds stoichiometrically to tubulin and promotes microtubule polymerization. noscapine causes growth arrest of tumor cells in mitosis and induces apoptosis of tumor cells in vitro. previous experiments also showed that noscapine has potent antitumor activity in mice when administered parenterally or by gastric lavage. here, we report that the anti-mitotic effect was specific to noscapine since closely related compounds did not inhibit the growth of a lymphoma cell line. in addition, noscapine was shown to be effective in reducing the growth of the lymphoma and increasing the survival of tumor-bearing mice when administered in the drinking water. it is noteworthy that, noscapine showed little or no toxicity to kidney, liver, heart, bone marrow, spleen or small intestine at tumor-suppressive doses. furthermore, oral noscapine did not inhibit primary immune responses, which are critically dependent upon proliferation of lymphoid cells. thus, our results indicate that noscapine has the potential to be an effective chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of human cancer.
metabolic alterations in the anterior cingulate cortex and related cognitive deficits in late adolescent methamphetamine users adolescence is a period of heightened vulnerability both to addictive behaviors and drug-induced brain damage. yet, only limited information exists on the brain mechanisms underlying these adolescent-specific characteristics. moreover, distinctions in brain correlates between predisposition to drug use and effects of drugs in adolescents are unclear. using cortical thickness and diffusion tensor image analyses, we found greater and more widespread gray and white matter alterations, particularly affecting the frontostriatal system, in adolescent methamphetamine (ma) users compared with adult users. among adolescent-specific gray matter alterations related to ma use, smaller cortical thickness in the orbitofrontal cortex was associated with family history of drug use. our findings highlight that the adolescent brain, which undergoes active myelination and maturation, is more vulnerable to ma-related alterations than the adult brain. furthermore, ma-use-related executive dysfunction was greater in adolescent ma users than in adult users. these findings may provide explanation for the severe behavioral complications and relapses that are common in adolescent-onset drug addiction. additionally, these results may provide insights into distinguishing the neural mechanisms that underlie the predisposition to drug addiction from effects of drugs in adolescents.
tradeoffs between the axial resolution and the signal-to-noise ratio in elastography this paper presents a theoretical framework for performance characterization in strain estimation, which includes the effect of signal decorrelation, quantization errors due to the finite temporal sampling rate, and electronic noise. an upper bound on the performance of the strain estimator in elastography is obtained from a strain filter constructed using these limits. the strain filter is a term used to describe the nonlinear filtering process in the strain domain (due to the ultrasound system and signal processing parameters) that allows the elastographic depiction of a limited range of strains from the compressed tissue. the strain filter predicts the elastogram quality by specifying the elastographic signal-to-noise ratio (snr/sub e/), sensitivity, and the strain dynamic range at a given resolution. the dynamic range is limited by decorrelation errors for large tissue strain values, and electronic noise for low strain values. tradeoffs between different techniques used to enhance elastogram image quality may also be analyzed using the strain filter.
mycobacterial ocular inflammation: delay in diagnosis and other factors impacting morbidity. intraocular manifestations of tuberculosis (tb) are rare, but tb infection is common worldwide, especially in developing economies, and in immigrant populations and immunocompromised patients in developed nations. the current review focuses on the clinical characteristics and diagnostic modalities useful in the diagnosis of intraocular tb. specifically, ifn-γ release assays (igras), antigen-detection assays, and polymerase chain reactions will be discussed. clinical management of tb patients includes counseling and testing for hiv infection. the use of corticosteroids along with anti-tuberculous medications and special therapeutic considerations in immunocompromised patients are discussed.
total parenteral nutrition , metabolic consequences , liver complication and role of some natural extracts objective: to assess the effect of endotoxemia on hepatic lipid content during parenteral nutrition (pn) in rats. methods: twenty male sprague-dawley rats (185–230 gm) were randomized to receive pn (n=9) or pn plus a continuous infusion of e. coli 026:b6 lipopolysaccharide (lps; n=11). all animals received isocaloric (170 kcal/kg/day), isonitrogenous (1.1 g n/kg/day), glucose-based pn for the next 78 hours. after 30 hours of adaptation to tpn, the animals were randomized to receive pn or pn plus lps at 6 mg/kg/day for the remaining 48 hours of study. the animals were euthanized and the livers were harvested. results: liver weight increased significantly (by 60%) from 7.5 ± 0.6 g to 12.1 ± 2.4 g (p ≤ 0.01) in the animals who received pn versus lps, respectively. the proportion of liver water remained the same for pn and lps groups (72.9 ± 3.2% versus 72.3 ± 3.8%, respectively, p = n.s.). however, liver fat increased disproportionately (by about 130%) from 0.20 ± 0.05 g to 0.46 ± 0.20 g (p ≤ 0.01) total fat weight or from 9.6 ± 1.8% to 13.6 ± 4.1% (p ≤ 0.02) lipid content (g/g) of the dry liver weight for the pn and lps groups, respectively. conclusion: endotoxin, when given concomitantly with parenteral nutrition, increases hepatic lipid accumulation and thus augments the development of parenteral nutrition-associated fatty liver in rats.
assessing biodiversity integrity for the conservation of grazed and burnt grassland systems: avian field metabolic rates as a rapid assessment tool in this study, we investigated the responses of two faunal groups, birds and arthropods, to varying degrees of disturbance caused by fire and grazing in south africa, eight study sites of varying fire frequency and stocking density were studied over two summer seasons (october–march). bird assemblages reflected habitat disturbance in a diversity of ways, driven by factors ranging from direct disturbance to changes in habitat structure and functioning, and shifts in food availability. similarly, arthropod diversity and abundance changed seasonally in response to management practices. fire frequency drives faunal assemblage structure and abundance and, in most cases, overrides the effects of grazing at all taxonomic levels. in particular, fire frequency strongly influenced grassland-breeding birds because farms are burnt in the territory-forming stage of the breeding cycle. insectivores and nectarivores were disproportionately impacted by intensive commercial management. of particular concern in this system is the yellow-breasted pipit (anthus chloris), which is regionally and globally vulnerable because of habitat loss. this species is sensitive to any form of habitat disturbance, highlighting the need for conservation attention in these grasslands. of the ten arthropod orders present in the study area, only orthoptera responded positively to burning. however, orthopterans made up on average 78% of arthropod biomass in moist highland grasslands, resulting in high grasshopper biomass on annually burnt farms: this high biomass in turn supports an abundance of insectivores. this reinforces the importance of process-oriented data where a measure of performance, such as reproductive success, is considered in assessing ecosystem condition.
the inability of bacillus licheniformis perr mutant to grow is mainly due to the lack of perr-mediated fur repression perr is a ferric uptake repressor (fur) homolog that functions as the central regulator of the inducible peroxide stress response in bacillus subtilis. perr has been previously demonstrated to regulate the mrga, kata, ahpcf, hemaxcdbl, and zosa genes. we now demonstrate that perr also mediates both the repression of its own gene and that of fur. whereas perr-mediated repression of most target genes can be elicited by either manganese or iron, repression of perr and fur is selective for manganese. genetic studies indicate that repression of perr regulon genes by either manganese or iron requires perr and is generally independent of fur. indeed, in a fur mutant, iron-mediated repression is enhanced. unexpectedly, repression of the fur gene by manganese appears to require both perr and fur, but only perr binds to the fur regulatory region in vitro. the fur mutation appears to act indirectly by affecting cellular metal ion pools and thereby affecting perr-mediated repression. while many components of the perr regulon are strongly induced by hydrogen peroxide, little, if any, induction of fur and perr could be demonstrated. thus, not all components of the perr regulon are components of the peroxide stimulon. we suggest that perr exists in distinct metallated forms that differ in dna target selectivity and in sensitivity to oxidation. this model is supported by the observation that the metal ion composition of the growth medium can greatly influence the transcriptional response of the various perr regulon genes to hydrogen peroxide.
size matters: genital allometry in an african mole-rat (family: bathyergidae) the interaction between functional and mechanistic approaches to sperm competition and between male and female perspectives are described and illustrated by a study of the zebra finch, taeniopygia guttata. sperm competition experiments in the laboratory show that last male sperm precedence occurs (as it does in many other taxa) although the mechanism is unknown (as in most other taxa). empirically-derived values were used to construct a mathematical model of sperm competition in the zebra finch. the model indicates that precedence occurs as a consequence of: (i) the temporal pattern of pair copulations; (ii) the rate at which sperm are lost from the female tract; and (iii) more sperm being transferred during extra-pair copulations than during pair copulations. the latter effect is a consequence of males seeking extra-pair copulations after their own pair copulation period has ended. the effect of sperm numbers on the pattern of sperm precedence may be further increased by: (i) extra-pair males increasing ejaculate size (sperm numbers) (for which there is no evidence); (ii) extra-pair males being of a better quality and transferring more sperm or better quality sperm (for which there is some evidence); and (iii) cryptic female choice. females eject over 99% of sperm following insemination; if they eject fewer sperm from males chosen as extra-pair copulation partners, the potential for cryptic female choice is considerable. however, this is still being investigated. the model also predicts the optimal time for an extra-pair copulation to occur (from either a male or female perspective). a comparison between the predicted and observed pattern suggests that the optimal timing of extra-pair copulations is constrained in both sexes.
linguistic database summaries using fuzzy logic: towards a human-consistent data mining tool we present the use of fuzzy logic for the derivation of linguistic summaries of data (databases) for providing efficient and human consistent means for the analysis of large amounts of data to be used for a more realistic business decision support. we concentrate on the issue of how to measure the goodness of a linguistic summary, and on how to embed data summarization within the fuzzy querying environment, for an effective and efficient computer implementation. finally, we present an implementation for deriving linguistic summaries of a sales database at a small-to-medium size computer retailer. by analyzing the linguistic summaries obtained we indicate how they can help make decisions by the business owner.
an analysis and design framework for agent-based social simulation vs descriptive artificial vs realistic positive vs normative
learning gene network using conditional dependence unlabelled inferring genetic network architecture from time series data generated from high-throughput experimental technologies, such as cdna microarray, can help us to understand the system behavior of living organisms. we have developed an interactive tool, genenetwork, which provides four reverse engineering models and three data interpolation approaches to infer relationships between genes. genenetwork enables a user to readily reconstruct genetic networks based on microarray data without having intimate knowledge of the mathematical models. a simple graphical user interface enables rapid, intuitive mapping and analysis of the reconstructed network allowing biologists to explore gene relationships at the system level.   availability download from http://genenetwork.sbl.bc.sinica.edu.tw/.   supplementary information supplement documentation of algorithms for the four approaches is downloadable at the above location.
clinicalarticle authors bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia some macrolides have been found to exert anti-inflammatory effects. lung diseases such as asthma, panbronchiolitis, cystic fibrosis, and bronchiectasis are thought to respond to the immunomodulatory properties of macrolides. we report three cases of idiopathic bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, now called cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, and three cases of radiation-related bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia that responded to macrolide therapy. an explanation of why macrolides may have anti-inflammatory effects in patients with these syndromes is discussed. these cases help to reinforce accumulating data that macrolides are beneficial as anti-inflammatory agents and organizing pneumonia may be another pulmonary disease that can benefit from such therapy.
signal detection in amplitude‐modulated maskers. ii. processing in the songbird's auditory forebrain coding of amplitude modulated acoustic stimuli was studied within isofrequency planes of the tonotopically organized field l, the avian analogue of the mammalian auditory cortex. the synchronization of unit responses to envelopes of sinusoidally amplitude modulated tones (am) and repetitive noise bursts (rn) were determined as a function of envelope frequency (ef). from 249 synchronizing units, 66% were tuned to a best envelope frequency (bef) using a synchronization criterion. befs varied from 0.3 to 380 hz and showed an orderly representation within isofrequency planes orthogonal to the lamination of field l. the majority (68%) of these units had befs below 20 hz down to 0.3 hz. thus, they were tuned to rhythms typical for animal communication sounds, speech, and music. thirty-two % had befs between 20 hz and 380 hz and covered at least 4 of 5 octaves of the range of periodicity pitch sensation.
screening for inhalational anthrax due to bioterrorism: evaluating proposed screening protocols. context in the event of a bioterrorist attack, it may be difficult to distinguish inhalational anthrax from viral respiratory tract disease. contribution this synthesis compares reported symptoms of 28 patients with inhalational anthrax and 4694 patients with viral respiratory tract illnesses. fever and cough were common in both infections. mental confusion or loss of consciousness, shortness of breath, and nausea and vomiting more often indicated anthrax, whereas sore throat and runny nose more often indicated viral infection. implications several symptoms, including neurologic and gastrointestinal symptoms and shortness of breath, may help distinguish inhalational anthrax from respiratory viral illness. the editors the 2001 anthrax attacks in the united states, in which 11 people developed the inhalational form of the disease and 5 died, exposed a weakness in the u.s. medical response to bioterrorism (1). despite heroic efforts on behalf of the victims, physicians were largely unprepared to recognize the early symptoms and signs of this extremely rare and rapidly progressive infection in ambulatory patients (2). initially, 4 of the 11 patients were sent home after being seen as outpatients or in an emergency department with diagnoses that included viral syndrome, bronchitis, and gastroenteritis (3, 4). physicians first considered a diagnosis of anthrax in 2 of these patients (both postal workers) on their second visits to the emergency department and then only after hearing media reports of illness among other postal employees (3). inhalation of anthrax spores leads to clinical disease from elaboration of two toxins, a calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase known as edema factor and a zinc metalloproteinase called lethal factor, by phagocytosed bacteria in the mediastinal lymph nodes and bloodstream (5). classic pathologic findings include hemorrhagic mediastinitis and hemorrhagic meningitis; primary anthrax pneumonia is rare (6, 7). without prompt treatment, death occurs rapidly from a combination of shock and respiratory compromise. anthrax has been classified by the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention as one of six category a bioterrorist agents posing the greatest risk to civilian populations (8). a large-scale anthrax attack has the potential to cause casualties on a scale that would quickly overwhelm local and regional health care treatment capacity (6). the emergency response to such an attack would probably include the establishment of multiple mass prophylaxis centers physically distinct from hospital emergency departments (to prevent overcrowding and potential contamination) for rapid dispensing of prophylactic antibiotics to exposed populations and for identifying individuals suspected of having inhalational anthrax (9). presumptive cases would be transferred to established or temporary medical care facilities for rapid definitive testing and initiation of combination antimicrobial treatment, which may improve outcomes (10-12). efficient management of this limited medical care capacity is an important secondary goal of outpatient triage during a bioterrorism response (13, 14). screening and triage protocols used in these settings would need to rely on presenting symptoms and signs because laboratory or radiographic testing will probably not be feasible in high-volume mass prophylaxis centers (15). we sought to establish an evidence base for developing a screening protocol for inhalational anthrax. the utility of such a protocol, which improves both case detection and case exclusion, would also extend beyond the immediate mass prophylaxis setting because large numbers of individuals outside the exposure zone will probably seek reassurance from health care providers for symptomatic illnesses in the aftermath of a major attack. providing scientific evidence on which to base these discussions may decrease postattack anxiety and inappropriate utilization of health care resources (16). methods clinical data on the 11 inhalational anthrax cases of 2001 are now widely available (3, 4, 17-20). because of the small number of cases in the contemporary attack, we performed a systematic literature review to identify additional original case reports of inhalational anthrax in the english-language medical literature. we searched two computerized databases (medline and web of science) for adult human case reports of anthrax infection between 1960 and 2000 using the keywords anthrax and case report. this yielded 44 references; 4 contained sufficient clinical data on inhalational anthrax to permit comparison with the 11 contemporary cases (21-24). tracing bibliographies of these articles and a recent review article (25) produced an additional 7 articles that were appropriate for inclusion, for a total of 11 reports on 17 cases (26-32). two of the cases involved patients from outside of the united states (22, 24). we interpreted lack of mention of a specific symptom or abnormal sign in these reports as indicating the absence of that finding from the patient's clinical presentation. we compared proportions of symptoms and signs in historical and contemporary cases using the fisher exact test; clinical features that had consistent prevalence rates in earlier and contemporary cases were candidates for comparison with viral respiratory tract disease. viral respiratory tract infections, such as with influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), parainfluenza, and rhinoviruses or coronaviruses, are appropriate comparison conditions for this study because of their prevalence and potential similarity to inhalational anthrax (15, 33). we searched medline for descriptive epidemiologic reports of presenting clinical features of laboratory-confirmed influenza and noninfluenza viral respiratory illnesses in ambulatory adults; we found five published studies that met the search criteria (34-38). we did not include studies that describe samples of mixed influenza and noninfluenza cases (39-42) or that present data already reported in these five studies (43). we did not compare anthrax cases with asymptomatic persons (because they would not present a screening dilemma) or with acutely ill patients (because they would probably not participate in mass screening). since there are no reports of inhalational anthrax in pediatric patients, we limited our comparison sample to adult patients. finally, we also compared anthrax cases to ambulatory patients with community-acquired pneumonia to highlight the difficulty of distinguishing these two conditions (44). we calculated positive likelihood ratios with 95% cis for the presence of selected signs and symptoms in inhalational anthrax versus influenza, influenza-like illness, and ambulatory community-acquired pneumonia. the positive likelihood ratio is defined here as the prevalence of a symptom or sign among inhalational anthrax cases divided by the prevalence of the same symptom or sign in the influenza, influenza-like illness, or pneumonia comparison groups. the positive likelihood ratio is the multiplicative factor that increases or decreases the odds of having inhalational anthrax as opposed to one of these comparison diseases, given the presence of a clinical finding (45). therefore, the post-test probability of having inhalational anthrax is influenced by both the magnitude of the positive likelihood ratio and the pretest probability of having the disease (46). in the appropriate clinical setting (that is, when the pretest probability of having the target disease is not zero), likelihood ratios greater than 3 or less than 0.3 are considered clinically important (47). the general approach used heredeveloping diagnostic algorithms for rare diagnoses by using likelihood ratios and by establishing hypothetical comparison groups populated by common medical conditionshas been previously described (46, 48, 49). the study sponsors had no role in the design, conduct, and reporting of the data or in the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. results presenting symptoms and signs and radiographic results for the 11 deliberately infected contemporary cases and 17 occupationally or environmentally infected historical cases were similar, although contemporary patients reported significantly more fever/chills and fatigue or malaise (table 1). all but 1 of the 28 patients (including 100% of the contemporary patients) had fever, chills, or cough on presentation. (the single exception was a patient who presented with impending shock, which limited the ability to record a complete history.) other symptoms that affected more than half of all patients included dyspnea (68%), chest discomfort or pain (61%), and nausea or vomiting (61%). more than half of current case-patients and 43% of the combined sample presented with neurologic symptoms other than headache, including confusion, blurred vision, and dizziness. only a few patients with inhalational anthrax reported sore throat (18%) or rhinorrhea (14%). table 1. summary of symptoms and signs at initial presentation: historical versus contemporary patients with inhalational anthrax eighty-one percent of patients presented with abnormalities on lung auscultation, including rales or rhonchi (65%) and dullness or decreased breath sounds (58%). respiratory symptoms often did not match findings on lung physical examination. four of the five patients with no respiratory symptoms had positive findings (rales), whereas 8 of the 23 patients with respiratory symptoms had no abnormality on lung examination. outcomes differed significantly between historical and contemporary patients: 16 of the 17 historical patients died compared with only 5 of the 11 contemporary patients. the presenting clinical features of the 28 patients can be divided into nine symptom complexes involving respiratory; gastrointestinal; ear, nose, and throat; and nonheadache neurologic problems (figure 1). the single most common presentation was a combination of respirato
contribution of vesicular glutamate transporters to stress response and related psychopathologies: studies in vglut3 knockout mice abstract: gaba and glutamate play a major role in central integration of hypothalamo‐pituitary‐adrenocortical (hpa) stress responses. recent work in our group has focused on mechanisms whereby gabaergic and glutamatergic circuits interact with parvocellular paraventricular nucleus (pvn) neurons controlling the hpa axis. gabaergic neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, preoptic area, and hypothalamus can directly inhibit pvn outflow and thereby reduce acth secretion. in contrast, glutamate activates the hpa axis, presumably by way of hypothalamic and brainstem projections to the pvn. these inhibitory and excitatory pvn‐projecting neurons are controlled by descending information from limbic forebrain structures, including glutamatergic neurons of the ventral subiculum, prefrontal cortex, and gabaergic cells from the amygdala and perhaps septum. lesion studies indicate that the ventral subiculum and prefrontal cortex are involved in inhibition of hpa axis responses to psychogenic stimuli, whereas the amygdala is positioned to enhance hormone secretion by way of gaba‐gaba disinhibitory connections. thus, it seems the psychogenic responses to stress are gated by discrete sets of gabaergic neurons in the basal forebrain and hypothalamus. as such, these neurons are positioned to summate limbic inputs into net inhibitory tone on the pvn and may thus play a major role in hpa dysfunction seen in affective disease states and aging.
aliskiren has chondroprotective efficacy in a rat model of osteoarthritis through suppression of the local renin-angiotensin system we examined the effects of angiotensin ii (ang ii) on the differentiation of rat calvarial osteoblastic cells and on the formation of bone by these cells. northern blotting analysis revealed that ang ii inhibited the expression of mrna for osteocalcin, which is a protein that is specifically expressed during maturation of osteoblastic cells. ang ii decreased the activity of alkaline phosphatase, a marker of osteoblastic differentiation, in the cells, acting via the type 1 (at1) receptor. we used von kossa staining to examine the formation of mineralized nodules by osteoblastic cells. both the number and the total area of mineralized nodules were quantified and shown to be decreased by 10(-7) m ang ii. the accumulation of calcium in cells and the matrix layer was also decreased by ang ii. binding analysis with subtype-specific antagonists revealed the presence of at1 receptors for ang ii in this culture system. ang ii caused a marked increase in the rate of production of intracellular camp in this system. our data suggest that ang ii might be intimately involved in osteoblastic metabolism through its interaction with the at1 receptor.
antecedents of onshore and offshore business process outsourcing outsourcing, whether of it or business processes, onshore or offshore, continues to raise expectations and pose challenges for private and public sector organizations alike. time and again, we found even experienced organizations running into massive problems, suffering from slow organizational learning, and working in a reactive rather than an anticipatory mode. the results are troubling. here are some recent examples:
divergence measures and message passing important inference problems in statistical physics, computer vision, error-correcting coding theory, and artificial intelligence can all be reformulated as the computation of marginal probabilities on factor graphs. the belief propagation (bp) algorithm is an efficient way to solve these problems that is exact when the factor graph is a tree, but only approximate when the factor graph has cycles. we show that bp fixed points correspond to the stationary points of the bethe approximation of the free energy for a factor graph. we explain how to obtain region-based free energy approximations that improve the bethe approximation, and corresponding generalized belief propagation (gbp) algorithms. we emphasize the conditions a free energy approximation must satisfy in order to be a "valid" or "maxent-normal" approximation. we describe the relationship between four different methods that can be used to generate valid approximations: the "bethe method", the "junction graph method", the "cluster variation method", and the "region graph method". finally, we explain how to tell whether a region-based approximation, and its corresponding gbp algorithm, is likely to be accurate, and describe empirical results showing that gbp can significantly outperform bp.
accurate refinement of docked protein complexes using evolutionary information and deep learning we present a set of geometric docking algorithms for rigid, flexible, and cyclic symmetry docking. the algorithms are highly efficient and have demonstrated very good performance in capri rounds 3–5. the flexible docking algorithm, flexdock, is unique in its ability to handle any number of hinges in the flexible molecule, without degradation in run‐time performance, as compared to rigid docking. the algorithm for reconstruction of cyclically symmetric complexes successfully assembles multimolecular complexes satisfying cn symmetry for any n in a matter of minutes on a desktop pc. most of the algorithms presented here are available at the tel aviv university structural bioinformatics web server (http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/). proteins 2005;60:224–231. © 2005 wiley‐liss, inc.
morphological anomalies of upper cervical vertebrae in children born with non-syndromic cleft lip and / or palate compared with children without cleft objective: to investigate anatomical variations and abnormalities of cervical spine morphology in unoperated infants with cleft lip and palate. design: retrospective cross-sectional investigation of infants born with nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate using computed tomography scans acquired for investigation of a spectrum of clinical conditions. setting: computed tomography scan data were obtained from 29 unoperated cleft lip and palate infants and 12 noncleft infants of malay origin, ages 0 to 12 months. methods: observational study of cervical spine computed tomography scans. heights of cervical vertebral bodies (c2-c7) and intervertebral spaces were measured from landmarks identified from computed tomography reformats and three-dimensional computed tomography reconstructions. linear modeling of heights and spaces, with age as a covariate, was undertaken to identify differences between the samples. results: anomalous features observed in the cleft lip and palate sample included short posterior arch of c1 (2/29), abnormal development of the anterior arch of c1 (2/29), and fusions of the posterior arch of c2 and c3 (2/29). no anomalies of the cervical spine were observed in the noncleft sample. although the heights of three cervical vertebral bodies were significantly smaller and two intervertebral spaces were significantly larger in infants with cleft lip and palate compared with noncleft infants (p < .05), overall length of the cervical spine did not differ significantly between the samples. conclusion: there was evidence for subtle upper spinal anomalies in the infant cleft lip and palate population. our finding of reduced size of some cervical vertebral bodies may reflect delayed upper spinal development in infants with cleft lip and palate.
do eportfolios contribute to learners’ reflective thinking activities? : a preliminary study of nursing staff users an information-exchange virtual community (vc) is an it-supported virtual space that is composed of a group of people for accessing, sharing and disseminating topic-related experiences and knowledge through communication and social interaction 36,43]. with the increasing number of vcs and low switching cost, it is challenging to retain existing users and encourage their continued participation. by integrating the is post-adoption research and is success model, we propose a research framework to investigate vc users' continuance intention from a quality perspective. based on a field survey, we find that information and system quality directly affect perceived individual benefits and user satisfaction, which ultimately determine user continuance intention to consume and to provide information. furthermore, by modeling information quality and system quality as multifaceted constructs, our results reveal key quality concerns in information-exchange vcs. implications for vc design and management are also discussed.
multikinase inhibitors in the treatment of thyroid cancer: specific role of lenvatinib purpose patients with advanced, incurable thyroid cancer not amenable to surgery or radioactive iodine ((131)i) therapy have few satisfactory therapeutic options. this multi-institutional study assessed the activity and safety of axitinib, an oral, potent, and selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (vegfr) 1, 2, and 3 in patients with advanced thyroid cancer.   patients and methods patients with thyroid cancer of any histology that was resistant or not appropriate for (131)i were enrolled onto a single-arm phase ii trial to receive axitinib orally (starting dose, 5 mg twice daily). objective response rate (orr) by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors was the primary end point. secondary end points included duration of response, progression-free survival (pfs), overall survival, safety, and modulation of soluble (s) vegfr.   results sixty patients were enrolled. partial responses were observed in 18 patients, yielding an orr of 30% (95% ci, 18.9 to 43.2). stable disease lasting > or = 16 weeks was reported in another 23 patients (38%).   objective responses were noted in all histologic subtypes. median pfs was 18.1 months (95% ci, 12.1 to not estimable). axitinib was generally well tolerated, with the most common grade > or = 3 treatment-related adverse event being hypertension (n = 7; 12%). eight patients (13%) discontinued treatment because of adverse events. axitinib selectively decreased svegfr-2 and svegfr-3 plasma concentrations versus skit, demonstrating its targeting of vegfr.   conclusion axitinib is a selective inhibitor of vegfr with compelling antitumor activity in all histologic subtypes of advanced thyroid cancer.
web service selection and classification of service requesters dynamic services selection is an important and challenging work, especially, when a set of services have similar functionality and are available to the requesters' demands. therefore, it is necessary to distinguish among these reliable services by computing the qos value. crucially, an optimal service can be selected depending on a combined evaluation of qualities of service (qos). at the same time, these web services that meet the users' requirements should support rapid and dynamic composition of services. in this paper, we presented a qos-based computation model for web service selection through improving the previous normalization algorithm by which the same qos value may be gained for different services. in addition, it should have minimal time overhead and more precise service location.
behavioral responses in mice selectively bred for high and low levels of open-field thigmotaxis an overview of ethologically-based animal models suitable for investigating the pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders is presented. the dsm-iiir classification provides a framework for the discussion. the limitations of the models in current use are considered. it is suggested that there is a need for a greater emphasis on animal models of anxiety with an etiological basis.
statins promote long-term recovery after ischemic stroke by reconnecting noradrenergic neuronal circuitry because neurogenesis persists in the adult mammalian brain and can be regulated by physiological and pathological events, we investigated its possible involvement in the brain's response to focal cerebral ischemia. ischemia was induced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in the rat for 90 min, and proliferating cells were labeled with 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine-5′-monophosphate (brdurd) over 2-day periods before sacrificing animals 1, 2 or 3 weeks after ischemia. ischemia increased the incorporation of brdurd into cells in two neuroproliferative regions—the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus and the rostral subventricular zone. both effects were bilateral, but that in the subgranular zone was more prominent on the ischemic side. cells labeled with brdurd coexpressed the immature neuronal markers doublecortin and proliferating cell nuclear antigen but did not express the more mature cell markers neun and hu, suggesting that they were nascent neurons. these results support a role for ischemia-induced neurogenesis in what may be adaptive processes that contribute to recovery after stroke.
intradural prostate carcinoma metastatic lesion mimicking an exophytic ependymoma: case report the management of 10 patients with symptomatic localized intradural extramedullary spinal metastasis is reviewed. the single most common primary source was carcinoma of the breast (four cases). the initial symptom in nine patients was pain, with five patients reporting a characteristically severe cramping discomfort with radicular distribution. all patients underwent laminectomy decompression. at the time of surgery, six of the patients were weak but ambulatory and four were bedridden. following surgery, four patients enjoyed some measure of pain relief, seven patients became ambulatory, and three remained bedridden. two patients achieved a "satisfactory" result, and were walking and continent 6 months after surgery. secondary brain tumors were demonstrated or implicated in nine patients, supporting the concept that the spinal metastases represented tertiary deposits following dissemination via the cerebrospinal fluid. symptomatic intradural extramedullary spinal metastasis causes a virulent clinical syndrome with poor prognosis and disappointing outcome after treatment. given the high incidence of associated cerebral metastatic involvement, total neuraxis radiation and/or chemotherapy should be considered when symptomatic spinal metastasis is discovered to be intradural and extramedullary.
power efficiency of outer hair cell somatic electromotility 1. the microchamber method was used to examine the motile responses of isolated guinea pig outer hair cells to electrical stimulation. in the microchamber method, an isolated cell is drawn partway into a suction pipette and stimulated transcellularly. the relative position of the cell in the microchamber is referred to as the exclusion fraction. 2. the length changes of the included and excluded segments were compared for constant sinusoidal stimulus amplitude as functions of the exclusion fraction. both included and excluded segments showed maximal responses when the cell was excluded approximately halfway. both segments showed smaller or absent responses when the cell was almost fully excluded or almost fully included. 3. when the cell was near to, but not at, the maximum exclusion, the included segment response amplitude was zero, whereas the excluded segment response amplitude was nonzero. in contrast, when the cell was nearly fully included, the excluded segment response amplitude was zero, but the included segment response amplitude was still detectable. a simple model of outer hair cell motility based on these results suggests that the cell has finite-resistance terminations and that the motors are restricted to a region above the nucleus and below its ciliated apex (cuticular plate). 4. the function describing length change as a function of command voltage was measured for each segment as the exclusion fraction was varied. the functions were similar at midrange exclusions (i.e., when the segments were about equal length), showing nonlinearity and saturability. the functions were strikingly different when the segment lengths were different. the effects of exclusion on the voltage to length-change functions suggested that the nonlinearity and saturability are local properties of the motility mechanism. 5. the diameter changes of both segments were examined. the segment diameter changes were always antiphasic to the length changes. this finding implies that the motility mechanism has an active antiphasic diameter component. the diameter change amplitude was a monotonically increasing function of exclusion for the included segment, and a decreasing function for the excluded segment. 6. the voltage to length-change and voltage to diameter-change functions were measured for the same cell and exclusion fraction. the voltage to diameter-change function was smaller in amplitude than the voltage to length-change function. the functions were of opposite polarity to each other, but were otherwise similar in character. thus it is likely that the same motor mechanism is responsible for both axial and diameter deformations.
phosphoinositide binding by the toll adaptor dmyd88 controls antibacterial responses in drosophila. the toll signaling pathway is required for the innate immune response against fungi and gram-positive bacteria in drosophila. here we show that the endosomal proteins myopic (mop) and hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (hrs) are required for the activation of the toll signaling pathway. this requirement is observed in cultured cells and in flies, and epistasis experiments show that the mop protein functions upstream of the myd88 adaptor and the pelle kinase. mop and hrs, which are critical components of the escrt-0 endocytosis complex, colocalize with the toll receptor in endosomes. we conclude that endocytosis is required for the activation of the toll signaling pathway.
melatonin modulates neuronal cell death induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress under insulin resistance condition most protein phosphatases have little intrinsic substrate specificity, making selective pharmacological inhibition of specific dephosphorylation reactions a challenging problem. in a screen for small molecules that protect cells from endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress, we identified salubrinal, a selective inhibitor of cellular complexes that dephosphorylate eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit alpha (eif2alpha). salubrinal also blocks eif2alpha dephosphorylation mediated by a herpes simplex virus protein and inhibits viral replication. these results suggest that selective chemical inhibitors of eif2alpha dephosphorylation may be useful in diseases involving er stress or viral infection. more broadly, salubrinal demonstrates the feasibility of selective pharmacological targeting of cellular dephosphorylation events.
expert opinion and recommendations for the management of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in correctional facilities attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd) is a chronic, lifelong disorder with childhood-onset, which seriously impairs the affected adults in a variety of daily living functions like educational and occupational functioning, partnership and parenting.adhd is associated with a high percentage of comorbid psychiatric disorders in every lifespan. in adulthood between 65–89% of all patients with adhd suffer from one or more additional psychiatric disorders, above all mood and anxiety disorders, substance use disorders and personality disorders, which complicates the clinical picture in terms of diagnostics, treatment and outcome issues. the present overview provides information of comorbid psychiatric disorders in adults with adhd, underlying associations and clinical implications.
frugivore choice and escape from pre-dispersal seed predators: the case of dialium guianense and two sympatric primate species in southern mexico here we review all published articles and book chapters, as well as unpublished theses and data of ateles geoffroyi diet to (1) summarize the literature; (2) synthesize general feeding patterns; (3) document plant taxonomic similarity in diet across study sites; and (4) suggest directions for future research and conservation priorities. we found 22 samples from five countries: mexico, guatemala, el salvador, costa rica and panama. tropical wet forest is the most studied habitat (n=13 samples), followed by tropical dry forest (6) and tropical moist forest (3). most samples have been carried out in large protected forests. in spite of showing an overall high dietetic diversity (364 species, 76 families), a. geoffroyi concentrated the majority of feeding time on a few species in the families moraceae and fabaceae. at all study sites fruits were the most common food item in the diet followed by leaves. furthermore, a greater variety of food items and less fruit were consumed in forest fragments. these findings suggest that fruit shortage in fragments results in primates using foods of presumably lower energetic content such as leaves. similarity in diet was higher among groups geographically closer to each other than among distant groups, showing that the floristic and phenological characteristics of the forest can influence diet composition. we conclude that several years of data are required to fully describe the dietary list of a. geoffroyi at any one site, as studies of the same group over different years shared as little as 56% of species. as most populations of a. geoffroyi live in highly fragmented landscapes, it is crucial to carry out studies in these areas to evaluate (1) changes in diet and activity patterns that may negatively affect survival; and (2) habitat attributes that may favor their persistence in altered landscapes. am. j. primatol. 71:8–20, 2009. © 2008 wiley‐liss, inc.
regioselective carboxylation of 1,3-dihydroxybenzene by 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate decarboxylase of pandoraea sp. 12b-2 a nonoxidative decarboxylase, 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate decarboxylase, was found in agrobacterium tumefaciens iam12048. the enzyme activity was induced specifically by 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate. the purified enzyme was a homotetramer of identical 38 kda subunits. the purified decarboxylase catalyzed the nonoxidative decarboxylation of 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate without requiring any cofactors. in the presence of khco3, the enzyme also catalyzed the regioselective carboxylation of 1,3-dihydroxybenzene into 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate at a molar conversion ratio of 30%.
parallel input channels to mouse primary visual cortex from the moment the mouse model took center stage for studies of cortical arealization and map formation, there was an urgent need for methods to identify areal borders in the living animal. the need was met in part by intrinsic optical signal imaging, which has been successfully applied to map topographic representations in primary visual, auditory and somatosensory cortex. however, the challenge remains to register these maps to the underlying structure. this is especially important for studies of the mouse brain in which cortical areas are often only a few hundred microns across. here, we show that in visual cortex neuronal tracing with fluororuby and fluoroemerald can be used for transcranial imaging through the intact skull of callosal connections from the opposite side of the brain, and for mapping of topographic striate-extrastriate cortical pathways in living mice. because callosal connections are important landmarks for cortical areas, the new method will allow registration of functional maps to underlying structures and facilitate targeted single-unit recordings in identified cortical areas.
climatic forcing on channel profiles in the eastern cordillera of the coroico region, bolivia the bolivian andes flank one of earth’s major topographic features and dominate sediment input into the amazon basin. millennial-scale erosion rates and dominant controls on erosion patterns in this range are poorly known. to define these patterns, we present 48 erosion rate estimates, derived from analysis of in situ 10 be in quartz-bearing alluvium collected from the upper beni river basin. erosion rates, corrected for the non-uniform distribution of quartz in the sample basins, range from 0·04 mm a −1 to 1·35 mm a −1 and thus integrate over 10 2 ‐10 4 years. mean and modal values are 0·42 (standard deviation: 0·29) and 0·2‐0·4 mm a −1 respectively, within the range of long-term average erosion rates in this area derived from apatite fission track thermochronology (0·1‐0·6 mm a −1 ). hence, our data do not record any significant variation in erosion rate over the last several million years. mean and modal short-term erosion rates for the andes are an order of magnitude lower than rates in the ganges river headwaters in the high himalaya and an order of magnitude greater than rates typical of the european alps. in the upper beni river region of the bolivian andes, short-term, basin-averaged erosion rates correlate with normalized channel steepness index, a metric of relative channel gradient corrected for drainage area. neither normalized channel steepness index nor basin-averaged erosion rate shows strong correlation with mean basin hillslope gradient or mean basin local relief because many hillslopes in the upper beni river region are at threshold values of slope and local relief. patterns of normalized channel steepness index appear primarily to reflect tectonic patterns and transient adjustment to those patterns by channel networks. climate and lithology do not appear to exert first-order controls on patterns of basin-averaged erosion rates in the bolivian andes. copyright © 2005 john wiley & sons, ltd.
chemobrain experienced by breast cancer survivors: a meta-ethnography study investigating research and care implications aims and objectives to investigate women's awareness of chemotherapy-induced cognitive changes, their perception of cognitive limitations in carrying out daily tasks and subsequent return to work decisions and perceptions of work ability.   background evidence suggests that women diagnosed with breast cancer experience cognitive changes as a consequence of chemotherapy treatment. although these changes tend to be subtle deficits in memory, concentration and the ability to organise information, there has been no published research identifying how they can impact patient's ability to work and subsequent employment decisions.   design this was a qualitative study.   method data were collected from breast cancer survivors using semi-structured interviews with two focus groups (n = 6, n = 7). interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using template analysis.   results data were categorised into four main themes: (1) awareness of cognitive changes during and following chemotherapy, (2) cognitive ability and confidence in return to work, (3) impact of cognitive changes on work ability and (4) information on the cognitive side effects of chemotherapy.   conclusions the views and experiences of breast cancer survivors towards returning to work and subsequent work ability were affected by chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment. more specifically the appraisal of returning to work and ability to manage work were influenced by three interrelated factors: (1) actual cognitive ability following chemotherapy, (2) awareness of cognitive failures by the women and their families and (3) the subsequent impact on their confidence in carrying out daily tasks including work tasks.   relevance to clinical practice more information and support is needed to help patients with cancer to manage chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairments in home and workplace. nurses are increasingly asked about the impact of cancer and its treatment on work and are therefore well positioned to offer this advice. subsequently, nurses require additional knowledge and guidance to provide this information and support.
cancer and congenital abnormalities in asian children: a population-based study from the west midlands. we present here the results of the largest study of childhood cancer and ethnic group in britain, based on 7,658 children treated at paediatric oncology centres throughout the country. incidence rates could not be calculated and so relative frequencies were analysed by the log-linear modelling method of kaldor et al. (1990) with allowance made for regional variations in the ages and diagnostic groups of the children included in the study. children of asian (indian sub-continent) and west indian ethnic origin had similar patterns of incidence for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia to white caucasians. there was a significant excess of hodgkin's disease among asian children compared with caucasians with an estimated relative risk (rr) of 2.09; this excess was greatest in the 0-4 age group (rr = 6.67). there were significant deficits of wilms' tumour and rhabdomyosarcoma among asian children, each with a frequency around half that among caucasians, whereas west indians had a significant excess of wilms' tumour (rr = 2.55). asian and west indian children each had a non-significant twofold rr for unilateral retinoblastoma. the results suggest that the incidence of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is associated with environmental determinants in the country of residence which are most likely to relate to lifestyle factors. the occurrence of retinoblastoma, wilms' tumour and hodgkin's disease in early childhood is apparently related more to ethnicity than to geographical location and may reflect genetic factors or environmental exposures specific to the lifestyle of particular ethnic groups.
role of the glycanases exok and exsh in regulating the molecular weight of the rhizobium meliloti exopolysaccharide succinoglycan summarysymbiotic mutants of rhizobium meliloti were isolated following tn5 mutagenesis. besides four nodulation mutants (nod-) unable to induce nodule formation on alfalfa, five infection mutants (inf-), which induce the formation of root nodules without detectable infection threads or bacteroids, were obtained. the inf- mutants were subdivided into two classes. one class contains mutants which fail to synthesize acidic exopolysaccharide (eps-). the other class is comprised of mutants which produce excess amounts of acidic exopolysaccharide (eps*). 13c nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the exopolysaccharide isolated from one of the latter type of inf- mutant, 101.45, revealed that the side chain of the repeating octosaccharide unit lacks the terminal pyruvate residue. complementing cosmids were isolated for all inf- mutants. in the case of the inf- eps- mutants the complementing cosmids contain dna segments which overlap and are part of megaplasmid 2. for two mutants the mutations were found to map on a 7.8 kb ecori fragment. in the case of the inf- eps* mutants the complementing cosmids carry chromosomal dna. the mutations of two inf- eps* mutants were localized on a 6.4 kb ecori fragment. coinoculation of alfalfa plants with nod- and inf- eps- mutants resulted in effective symbiosis. the nodules appeared wild type and fixed nitrogen. in constrast, coinoculations with nod- mutants and the inf- eps* mutant 101.45 did not result in the formation of effective nodules.

anomalous glutamate/alkali cation symport in larval manduca sexta midgut. uptake of tritiated leucine, alanine, and phenylalanine was measured at the physiological ph of 10 by rapid filtration in brush-border membrane vesicles from the midgut of the larval tobacco hornworm, manduca sexta. a 20-fold excess of unlabeled leucine, isoleucine, methionine, valine, alanine, lysine, histidine, phenylalanine, and glutamine inhibited uptake of leucine and phenylalanine, and six of these amino acids inhibited uptake of alanine, by more than 50% both in the presence and absence of a potassium ion gradient. these inhibitory amino acids also drove countertransport of leucine, alanine, and phenylalanine with accumulation ratios exceeding 2. these results are consistent with the hypothesis that leucine, alanine, and phenylalanine share a common uptake system - a broad scope b type symporter - which interacts strongly with half of the commonly occurring amino acids, interacts moderately with an additional quarter of them, but does not interact with cysteine, arginine, glutamate, aspartate, or proline.
investigating factors influencing consumer willingness to buy gm food and nano-food nanotechnology is increasingly being employed in the areas of food production and packaging. public perception will be crucial to the realization of these technological advances. we examined how lay people (n=153) perceive nanotechnology foods and nanotechnology food packaging, and we examined the factors that influence willingness to buy these products. participants received some general information about nanotechnology, and specific information about four nanotechnology applications. overall, participants were hesitant to buy nanotechnology foods or food with nanotechnology packaging. results suggest, however, that nanotechnology packaging is perceived as being more beneficial than nanotechnology foods. results further suggest that social trust in the food industry is an important factor directly influencing the affect evoked by these new products. as suggested by the affect heuristic, affect had an impact on perceived benefits and perceived risks. perceived benefit seems to be the most important predictor for willingness to buy.
software quality economics for defect-detection techniques using failure prediction how can we determine the added value of software verification techniques over the more readily available conventional testing techniques? formal verification techniques introduce both added costs and potential benefits. can we show objectively when the benefits will outweigh the cost?
tick-borne encephalitis virus sequenced directly from questing and blood-feeding ticks reveals quasispecies variance tick-borne encephalitis virus (tbev) is a flavivirus with major impact on global health. the geographical tbev distribution is expanding, thus making it pivotal to further characterize the natural virus populations. in this study, we completed the earlier partial sequencing of a tbev pulled out of a pool of rna extracted from 115 ticks collected on torö in the stockholm archipelago. the total rna was sufficient for all sequencing of a tbev genome (torö-2003), without conventional enrichment procedures such as cell culturing or suckling mice amplification. to our knowledge, this is the first time that the genome of tbev has been sequenced directly from an arthropod reservoir. the torö-2003 sequence has been characterized and compared with other tbe viruses. in silico analyses of secondary rna structures formed by the two untranslated regions revealed a temperature-sensitive structural shift between a closed replicative form and an open aug accessible form, analogous to a recently described bacterial thermoswitch. additionally, novel phylogenetic conserved structures were identified in the variable part of the 3'-untranslated region, and their sequence and structure similarity when compared with earlier identified structures suggests an enhancing function on virus replication and translation. we propose that the thermo-switch mechanism may explain the low tbev prevalence often observed in environmentally sampled ticks. finally, we were able to detect variations that help in the understanding of virus adaptations to varied environmental temperatures and mammalian hosts through a comparative approach that compares rna folding dynamics between strains with different mammalian cell passage histories.
early motor balance and coordination training increased synaptophysin in subcortical regions of the ischemic rat brain neurons are specialized cells with a complex morphology that represent the functional unit of the nervous system. they are generated in remarkable numbers, particularly in higher vertebrates. in the human brain, for example, there may be ∼85 billion neurons (williams and herrup 1988). there is little cell division in the adult nervous system of vertebrates, and in most areas, the final number of neurons is determined early in development, at about the time when neurons extend axons (oppenheim 1991). neuronal numbers are controlled both by cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic programs. cell-intrinsic programs govern basic aspects of neuronal differentiation in vertebrates, and a number of transcription factors have been shown to be expressed in well-defined areas of the nervous system (for review, see rubenstein et al. 1998). cell-extrinsic mechanisms play a prominent role in vertebrates. they involve the secretion of diffusible molecules controlling the survival of neurons produced in excess early in development, a process thought to help match the size of neuronal populations with the territory they innervate (purves 1988; oppenheim 1991). however, much of the developmental growth of the animal must still take place by the time these numerical adjustments are completed (purves 1988). the neurons that have escaped elimination grow proportionally with the organism, enlarging their size by adding dendrites that grow out from the cell bodies. secreted proteins play a crucial role in the control of neuronal numbers and of dendritic growth. the best studied group is a family of structurally related molecules termed neurotrophins (barde 1990). the first neurotrophin identified was originally designated “the” nerve growth factor (ngf; levi-montalcini 1966). however, only very few neurons were found to be ngf responsive in the central nervous system (cns), and the isolation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) from the brain helped establish the concept that the fate and the shape of most vertebrate neurons can be regulated by diffusible growth factors (hofer and barde 1988). in the context of the regulation of neuronal shape, a particularly attractive and important feature of the neurotrophins is that they are synthesized and released by neurons and that both their biosynthesis and secretion depend on neuronal activity (thoenen 1995). in addition to ngf and bdnf, two other neurotrophin genes have been identified in mammals, neurotrophin-3 (nt3) and neurotrophin-4/5 (nt4/5). these four genes encode pre-pro-neurotrophins. the processed proteins have a size of ∼13,000 d, and they exist in solution as noncovalently linked homodimers (for review, see barde 1990; ibanez 1998). they all have very basic isoelectric points, a somewhat unusual property for secreted proteins, which may serve the purpose of limiting their range of action. the structural hallmark of the protomer is a characteristic arrangement of the disulfide bridges known as the cystine knot (mcdonald et al. 1991), later identified in other secreted proteins such as the plateletderived growth factors and the transforming growth factor– s (tgfs; mcdonald and hendrickson 1993). with the exception of nt4/5, neurotrophin sequences are highly conserved in mammals. in bony fishes, more neurotrophin and receptor genes have been isolated than in mammals (for review, see hallbook 1999). based on sequence comparisons and on the isolation of neurotrophin genes in various vertebrates, it is thought that ngf/nt3 and bdnf/nt4/5 evolved from separate duplication events (hallbook 1999). the most primitive neurotrophin genes have been isolated from jawless fishes, a river lamprey and the atlantic hagfish. the jawless fish lineage diverged about 460 million years ago in vertebrate history, and the neurotrophin receptors of the trk family (see below) seem to have coevolved with the neurotrophin genes (hallbook, 1999). so far, no neurotrophin-like sequences have been detected in invertebrates typically used by geneticists, and unlike other growth factors such as members of the wnt, fibroblast growth factor or tgffamilies, genes coding for neurotrophins and their receptors have not been identified in the genome of the nematode caenorhabditis elegans (bargmann 1998). clearly then, a nervous system can be put together in the absence of neurotrophins, including precise wiring, chemical neurotransmission, and the 1corresponding author. e-mail yves.barde@neuro.mpg.de; fax 49-89-8578-3749. article and publication are at www.genesdev.org/cgi/doi/10.1101/ gad.841400.
transdisciplinary teamwork: the experience of clinicians at a functional restoration program primary health care is undergoing significant organizational change, including the development of interdisciplinary health care teams. understanding how teams function effectively in primary care will assist training programs in teaching effective interprofessional practices. this study aimed to explore the views of members of primary health care teams regarding what constitutes a team, team effectiveness and the factors that affect team effectiveness in primary care. focus group consultations from six teams in the department of family medicine at queen's university were recorded and transcribed and qualitative analysis was used to identify themes. twelve themes were identified that related to the impact of dual goals/obligations of education and clinical/patient practice on team relationships and learners; the challenges of determining team membership including nonattendance of allied health professionals except nurses; and facilitators and barriers to effective team function. this study provides insight into some of the challenges of developing effective primary care teams in an academic department of family medicine. clear goals and attention to teamwork at all levels of collaboration is needed if effective interprofessional education is to be achieved. future research should clarify how best to support the changes required for increasingly effective teamwork.
a thiazole orange derivative targeting the bacterial protein ftsz shows potent antibacterial activity 3-methoxybenzamide (1) is a weak inhibitor of the essential bacterial cell division protein ftsz. alkyl derivatives of 1 are potent antistaphylococcal compounds with suboptimal drug-like properties. exploration of the structure−activity relationships of analogues of these inhibitors led to the identification of potent antistaphylococcal compounds with improved pharmaceutical properties.
microbial degradation of isosaccharinic acid at high ph abstract. six strains of denitrifying bacteria isolated from various oxic and anoxic habitats on different monocyclic aromatic substrates were characterized by sequencing 16s rrna genes, determining physiological and morphological traits, and dna-dna hybridization. according to these criteria, strains s100, sp and lg356 were identified as members of thauera aromatica. strains b5–1 and b5–2 were tentatively affiliated to the species azoarcus tolulyticus. strains b4p and s2 were only distantly related to each other and to other described thauera species. these two strains are proposed as the type strains of two new species, thauera phenylacetica sp. nov. and thauera aminoaromatica sp. nov., respectively. by 16s rrna gene analysis, strain u120 was highly related to the type strains of azoarcus evansii and azoarcusanaerobius, whereas corresponding dna-dna reassociation values indicated only a low degree of genomic relatedness. based upon a low dna similarity value and the presence of distinguishing physiological properties, strain u120 is proposed as the type strain of a new species, azoarcus buckelii sp. nov. almost all of the new isolates were obtained with different substrates. the highly varied substrate spectra of the isolates indicates that an even higher diversity of denitrifying bacteria degrading aromatic compounds would be discovered in the different habitats by using a larger spectrum of aromatic substrates for enrichment and isolation.
subcutaneous dissociative conscious sedation (sdcs) an alternative method for airway regional blocks: a new approach laparoscopy is an effective method of implantation for peritoneal dialysis (pd) catheters. use of the laparoscopic technique is increasing because of its potential advantages over other techniques. in most patients, selection for pd is based on negative criteria, and because of the need for general anesthesia, the laparoscopic technique can be life-threatening in these patients. on the other hand, local anesthesia is insufficient for laparoscopic catheter implantation. to avoid the need for general anesthesia and to achieve patient safety and satisfaction, we designed a type of conscious sedation (dissociative conscious sedation) and compared the efficacy of subcutaneous (sc) and intravenous (iv) ketamine added to narcotics in patients scheduled for laparoscopic implantation of a pd catheter. ♦ methods: our prospective randomized double-blind study enrolled 60 adult patients with chronic renal failure who were scheduled for laparoscopic implantation of a pd catheter. patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: one receiving iv ketamine, and the other receiving sc ketamine. in both groups, patients were premedicated with iv midazolam 0.015 mg/kg, fentanyl 1–2 μg/kg, and lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg. patients then received 0.6 mg/kg ketamine either intravenously (iv group) or by subcutaneous injection at the anterior aspect of the forearm (sc group). if systolic blood pressure (bp) increased more than 20% from baseline or exceeded 170 mmhg, iv nitroglycerine (tng) 50 μg was administered incrementally (repeated 50-μg doses). after a desirable level of conscious sedation was achieved, local anesthesia and nitrous oxide pneumoperitoneum were applied, and the pd catheter was implanted under laparoscopic guidance. heart rate and bp were measured throughout the procedure. adverse effects and recovery events were recorded. ♦ results: all patients tolerated the procedure well. administration of tng was significantly more frequent in the iv ketamine group. pain intensity during the surgery was similar in both groups. both groups were comparable with regard to heart rate, but patients in the sc ketamine group had a significantly lower systolic bp at the 2nd measurement and a lower rate–pressure product at the 2nd, 4th, and 5th measurements. all patients in the sc ketamine group were cooperative during surgery and experienced uneventful recoveries; mild hallucinations were observed in 5 patients in the iv ketamine group. in the iv ketamine group, 3 patients lost the ability to cooperate during surgery. all catheters were successfully placed. ♦ conclusions: dissociative conscious sedation is an acceptable alternative to general anesthesia in laparoscopic implantation of the pd catheter. ketamine by the sc route is as effective as, but safer than, iv ketamine.
kicking out the trolls - antecedents of social exclusion intentions in facebook groups we investigated how intentions to hide and unfriend facebook contacts were linked to perceived sender attractiveness and face-threating messages (ftas). intention to hide was higher than intention to unfriend contacts, implying that unfriending is harsher. low social attractiveness predicted hiding and unfriending intentions, but low physical attractiveness was only linked to hiding. disrespectful messages were linked to hiding contacts, while updates that made the receiver look bad were linked to unfriending. ftas also mediated the influence of social and physical attractiveness on hiding and unfriending contacts. overall, managing online relationships relied on independent and interdependent perceptual and behavioral processes.
efficient content authentication over distributed hash tables we define a new authentication tree in the symmetric key setting, which has the same computational time, storage and security parameters as the well known merkle authentication tree, but which unlike the latter, allows for all the cryptographic operations required for an update to be performed in parallel. as in merkle authentication trees, the cryptographic operations required for verification can also be parallelized. in particular, we show a provably secure scheme for incremental mac with partial authentication secure against substitution and replay attacks, which on total data of size 2n blocks, and given n cryptographic engines, can compute incremental macs and perform individual block authentication with a critical path of only one cryptographic operation
exposure to a histone deacetylase inhibitor has detrimental effects on human lymphocyte viability and function classical zinc-dependent histone deacetylases (hdacs) catalyse the removal of acetyl groups from histone tails and also from many non-histone proteins, including the transcription factor foxp3, a key regulator of the development and function of regulatory t cells. many hdac inhibitors are in cancer clinical trials, but a subset of hdac inhibitors has important anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive effects that might be of therapeutic benefit in immuno-inflammatory disorders or post-transplantation. at least some of these effects result from the ability of hdac inhibitors to enhance the production and suppressive functions of foxp3+ regulatory t cells. understanding which hdacs contribute to the regulation of the functions of regulatory t cells may further stimulate the development of new class- or subclass-specific hdac inhibitors with applications beyond oncology.

dermatological complications after solid organ transplantation background mycetoma is a chronic granulomatous infection involving cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues. it is endemic in tropical and subtropical areas, but sporadic cases have been reported also in countries of temperate climate. the purpose of this paper is to review the cases of mycetoma in european subjects (and presumably acquired in europe), to give an insight in the main factors associated with this condition, and to describe two previously unpublished cases observed at our centre. methods and findings pubmed was systematically searched for case reports and case series of mycetoma in europeans reported between 1980 and 2014, using specific search strategies. two further cases diagnosed by the authors are described. forty-two cases were collected. eleven cases were caused by scedosporium apiospermium, mainly in immunosuppressed patients from bulgaria, germany, the netherlands, portugal, slovenia, spain and the united kingdom. excluding all patients with immunosuppression, 29 cases remain. most of them were reported from bulgaria and in albanian patients (all diagnosed outside albania). in the bulgarian case series many different micro-organisms, both bacteria and fungi, were isolated, while all the 5 cases from albania were caused by actinomadura spp. other countries reporting cases were greece, italy and turkey. in general, actinomadura spp is the most frequent causative agent isolated, followed by nocardia spp and madurella mycetomatis. the foot was the most reported site involved. most patients were medically treated, but unfortunately a long-term follow up (at least one year) was available only in a few cases. conclusions our review and our own cases suggest that europeans without travel history can be affected by madura foot. the lack of a surveillance system is likely to cause an underreporting of cases. moreover, the unfamiliarity of western doctors with this peculiar infection may cause a mismanagement, including unnecessary amputations.
archetypal personalities of software engineers and their work preferences: a new perspective for empirical studies context: there is an increasing awareness among software engineering (se) researchers and practitioners that more focus is needed on understanding the engineers developing software. previous studies show significant associations between the personalities of software engineers and their work preferences. objective: various studies on personality in se have found large, small or no effects and there is no consensus on the importance of psychometric measurements in se. there is also a lack of studies employing other psychometric instruments or using larger datasets. we aim to evaluate our results in a larger sample, with software engineers in an earlier state of their career, using advanced statistics. method: an operational replication study where extensive psychometric data from 279 master level students have been collected in a se program at a swedish university. personality data based on the five-factor model, trait emotional intelligence questionnaire and self-compassion have been collected. statistical analysis investigated associations between psychometrics and work preferences and the results were compared to our previous findings from 47 se professionals. results: analysis confirms existence of two main clusters of software engineers; one with more "intense" personalities than the other. this corroborates our earlier results on se professionals. the student data also show similar associations between personalities and work preferences. however, for other associations there are differences due to the different population of subjects. we also found connections between the emotional intelligence and work preferences, while no associations were found for self-compassion. conclusion: the associations can help managers to predict and adapt projects and tasks to available staff. the results also show that the emotional intelligence instrument can be predictive. the research methods and analytical tools we employ can detect subtle associations and reflect differences between different groups and populations and thus can be important tools for future research as well as industrial practice.
ouabain protects mice against lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury ouabain, a potent inhibitor of the na+, k+-atpase, was identified as an endogenous substance. recently, ouabain was shown to affect various immunological processes. we have previously demonstrated the ability of ouabain to modulate inflammation, but little is known about the mechanisms involved. thus, the aim of the present work is to evaluate the immune modulatory role of ouabain on zymosan-induced peritonitis in mice. our results show that ouabain decreased plasma exudation (33%). after induction of inflammation, oua treatment led to a 46% reduction in the total number of cells, as a reflex of a decrease of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, which does not appear to be due to cell death. furthermore, oua decreased tnf-α (57%) and il-1β (58%) levels, without interfering with il-6 and il-10. also, in vitro experiments show that ouabain did not affect endocytic capacity. moreover, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (emsa) shows that zymosan treatment increased (85%) nf-κb binding activity and that ouabain reduced (30%) nf-κb binding activity induced by zymosan. therefore, our data suggest that ouabain modulated acute inflammatory response, reducing the number of cells and cytokines levels in the peritoneal cavity, as well as nfκb activation, suggesting a new mode of action of this substance.
light-dependent decomposition of ficz, an endogenous ligand of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor the physiological role of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (ahr), a member of the basic helix-loop-helix per-arnt-sim (pas) transcription factor family is not known. we have suggested that the ahr is involved in light signaling through binding of photoproducts with high ahr affinity. this suggestion is based on (i) the high ahr affinity of the tryptophan photoproduct formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (ficz), (ii) the induction of rapid and transient expression of ahr-regulated genes by ficz and by extracts of uv-irradiated tryptophan as well as (iii) the fact that light induces the ahr-regulated cytochrome p450s cyp1a1, cyp1b1 and cyp2s1. the transient mrna expression caused by light and tryptophan photoproducts suggests that the biotransformation enzymes induced by ahr activation take part in a metabolic degradation of the natural ahr ligand. this study aimed at identifying the involvement of phase i and phase ii enzymes in the metabolic degradation of ficz. a cytochrome p450-dependent metabolism of ficz giving rise to preferentially mono- and di-hydroxylated derivatives has earlier been reported. in the present study, rat and human hepatic s9 mixes were employed together with specific enzyme inhibitors and cofactors. compared to the aroclor-induced rat liver s9, the non-induced rat liver s9 and the human liver s9 caused a more complex metabolite profile of ficz. the cyp1a1 enzyme was confirmed to be the most important enzyme for the first step in the metabolism. cyp1a2 was found to have overlapping specificity with cyp1a1 being able to form the same major metabolites although with different kinetics. cyp1b1 turned out to be preferentially involved in the further metabolism of dihydroxylated metabolites. microsomal epoxide hydrolase, and as yet not identified forms of sulphotransferases and glucuronosyltransferases were also found to take part in the metabolic degradation of ficz. thus, tryptophan photoproducts fit into a model in which the ligand-activated ahr signaling is autoregulated by the induced metabolic enzymes.
analysis of intra-institutional research collaboration: a case of a serbian faculty of sciences a network is said to show assortative mixing if the nodes in the network that have many connections tend to be connected to other nodes with many connections. here we measure mixing patterns in a variety of networks and find that social networks are mostly assortatively mixed, but that technological and biological networks tend to be disassortative. we propose a model of an assortatively mixed network, which we study both analytically and numerically. within this model we find that networks percolate more easily if they are assortative and that they are also more robust to vertex removal.
the functional-morphological adaptive strategy of digestive organs of decapodiform cephalopods 1. the degestive mechanism has been investigated in loligo forbesii, l.vulgaris, alloteuthis media , and a. subulata . histology and morphology were examined on living and fixed material and the feeding of l.vulgaris was observed in the living animal. 2. the food is bitten by the jaws and rapidly swallowed; the radula has no rasing action. 3. preliminary digestion takes place in the stomach, which is cuticle-lined. 4. the caecum is a complex organ, containing the opening of the mid-gut gland. this opening is connected with the closing mechanism of the caeco-intestinal opening in such a way that the hepato-pancreatic secretion can be directed either to the caecum or to the stomach. the anterior part of the caecum contains a ciliary collecting mechanism whose main groove lads along the intestine towards the anus. 5. the posterior part of the caecum is a simple ciliated sac where digestion is competed, food absorbed, and pancreatic secretion stored between meals. solid food other than particulate is never found in the caecum. 6. the intestine is a short, straight tube, lined with a ciliated and mucous epithelium. absorption also takes place here, and continues after the caecum has ceased absorbing. 7. the junction of intestine and rectum is considered to be defined by the, replacement of the ciliated epithelium by one with a hyaline border. 8. the rectum is short; in the region of the rectal sphincter it is lined with cells bearing curious retractile processes, whose possible function is discussed. 9. the mid-gut gland secretes all digestive enzymes; it is divided into two unequal and markedly different glands: the so-called ‘liver’ and ‘pancreas’. these are connected in series, so that hepatic secretion flows through the main lumen of the pancreas to reach the caecum. 10. hepatic secretion is passed into the caecum only during digestion. the liver has a single type of cell in which food reserves also accumulate. the hepatic duct can be closed by a sphincter. 11. pancreatic secretion accumulates in the caecum between meals and apparently passes to the stomach during digestion. the structure and rhythm of the cells of the pancreas and the nature of its blood-supply suggest some second activity, possibly directed towards the blood-stream, alternating with that of enzyme-secretion. 12. food is not absorbed in the mid-gut gland. 13. the structural and functional peculiarities of the digestive system of these squids may be related to an exceptionally speedy and efficient digestive mechanism, well fitted to the life of a perpetually swimming, active predator.
axonal disruption in white matter underlying cortical sulcus tau pathology in chronic traumatic encephalopathy recognizing and managing the effects of cerebral concussion is very challenging, given the discrete symptomatology. most individuals with sports-related concussion will not score below 15 on the glasgow coma scale, but will present with rapid onset of short-lived neurological impairment, demonstrating no structural changes on traditional magnetic resonance imaging (mri) and computed tomography (ct) scans. the return-to-play decision is one of the most difficult responsibilities facing the physician, and so far this decision has been primarily based on neurological examination, symptom checklists, and neuropsychological (np) testing. diffusion tensor imaging (dti) may be a more objective tool to assess the severity and recovery of function after concussion. we assessed white matter (wm) fiber tract integrity in varsity level college athletes with sports-related concussion without loss of consciousness, who experienced protracted symptoms for at least 1 month after injury. evaluation of fractional anisotropy (fa) and mean diffusivity (md) of the wm skeleton using tract-based spatial statistics (tbss) revealed a large cluster of significantly increased md for concussed subjects in several wm fiber tracts in the left hemisphere, including parts of the inferior/superior longitudinal and fronto-occipital fasciculi, the retrolenticular part of the internal capsule, and posterior thalamic and acoustic radiations. qualitative comparison of average fa and md suggests that with increasing level of injury severity (ranging from sports-related concussion to severe traumatic brain injury), md might be more sensitive at detecting mild injury, whereas fa captures more severe injuries. in conclusion, the tbss analysis used to evaluate diffuse axonal injury of the wm skeleton seems sensitive enough to detect structural changes in sports-related concussion.
cell death induced by zinc and cadmium is mediated by clusterin in cultured mouse seminiferous tubules nuclear clusterin (nclu) is an ionizing radiation (ir)-inducible protein that binds ku70, and triggers apoptosis when overexpressed in mcf-7 cells. we demonstrate that endogenous nclu synthesis is a product of alternative splicing. reverse transcriptase-pcr analyses revealed that exon ii, containing the first aug and encoding the endoplasmic reticulum-targeting peptide, was omitted. exons i and iii are spliced together placing a downstream aug in exon iii as the first available translation start site. this shorter mrna produces the 49-kda precursor nclu protein. ku70 binding activity was localized to the c-terminal coiled-coil domain of nclu. leucine residues 357, 358, and 361 of nclu were necessary for ku70-nclu interaction. the n- and c-terminal coiled-coil domains of nclu interacted with each other, suggesting that the protein could dimerize or fold. mutation analyses indicate that the c-terminal nls was functional in nclu with the same contribution from n-terminal nls. the c-terminal coiled-coil domain of nclu was the minimal region required for ku binding and apoptosis. mcf-7 cells show nuclear as well as cytoplasmic expression of gfp-nclu in apoptotic cells. cytosolic aggregation of gfp-nclu was found in viable cells. these results indicate that an inactive precursor of nclu exists in the cytoplasm of non-irradiated mcf-7 cells, translocates into the nucleus following ir, and induces apoptosis.
concurrent search data structures can be blocking and practically wait-free mutual-exclusion locks are currently the most popular mechanism for interpro-cess synchronisation, largely due to their apparent simplicity and ease of implementation. in the parallel-computing environments that are increasingly commonplace in high-performance applications, this simplicity is deceptive: mutual exclusion does not scale well with large numbers of locks and many concurrent threads of execution. highly-concurrent access to shared data demands a sophisticated 'fine-grained' locking strategy to avoid serialising non-conflicting operations. such strategies are hard to design correctly and with good performance because they can harbour problems such as deadlock, priority inversion and convoying. lock manipulations may also degrade the performance of cache-coherent multiprocessor systems by causing coherency conflicts and increased interconnect traffic, even when the lock protects read-only data. in looking for solutions to these problems, interest has developed in lock-free data structures. by eschewing mutual exclusion it is hoped that more efficient and robust systems can be built. unfortunately the current reality is that most lock-free algorithms are complex, slow and impractical. in this dissertation i address these concerns by introducing and evaluating practical abstractions and data structures that facilitate the development of large-scale lock-free systems. firstly, i present an implementation of two useful abstractions that make it easier to develop arbitrary lock-free data structures. although these abstractions have been described in previous work, my designs are the first that can be practically implemented on current multiprocessor systems. secondly, i present a suite of novel lock-free search structures. this is interesting not only because of the fundamental importance of searching in computer science and its wide use in real systems, but also because it demonstrates the implementation issues that arise when using the practical abstractions i have developed. finally, i evaluate each of my designs and compare them with existing lock-based and lock-free alternatives. to ensure the strongest possible competition, several of the lock-based alternatives are significant improvements on the best-known solutions in the literature. these results demonstrate that it is possible to build useful data structures with all the perceived benefits of lock-freedom and with performance better than sophisticated lock-based designs. furthermore, and contrary to popular belief, this work shows that existing hardware primi-tives are sufficient to build practical lock-free implementations of complex data structures.
on the information propagation in mobile ad-hoc networks using epidemic routing mobile ad hoc routing protocols allow nodes with wireless adaptors to communicate with one another without any pre-existing network infrastructure. existing ad hoc routing protocols, while robust to rapidly changing network topology, assume the presence of a connected path from source to destination. given power limitations, the advent of short-range wireless networks, and the wide physical conditions over which ad hoc networks must be deployed, in some scenarios it is likely that this assumption is invalid. in this work, we develop techniques to deliver messages in the case where there is never a connected path from source to destination or when a network partition exists at the time a message is originated. to this end, we introduce epidemic routing, where random pair-wise exchanges of messages among mobile hosts ensure eventual message delivery. the goals of epidemic routing are to: i) maximize message delivery rate, ii) minimize message latency, and iii) minimize the total resources consumed in message delivery. through an implementation in the monarch simulator, we show that epidemic routing achieves eventual delivery of 100% of messages with reasonable aggregate resource consumption in a number of interesting scenarios.
a seed-based cross-modal comparison of brain connectivity measures the ability to generate intentional behavior is undeniably at the core of what makes us acting subjects. intentional actions consist of at least 2 components (brass m, haggard p. 2008. the what, when, whether model of intentional action. neuroscientist. 14:319-325.): choosing an appropriate behavior (what) and selecting the moment of execution (when). the aim of this study was to identify differing and overlapping neural networks underlying the "what" and "when" of intentional movement initiation. while scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging, 35 healthy subjects performed self-initiated and reactive, that is, internally and externally triggered movements of the right or left index finger in 3 experimental conditions: 1) "free choice" (free timing: when/choice of hand: what), 2) "timed choice" (external timing/choice of hand: what), and 3) "no choice" (external timing/cued hand). the what-component specifically employed the presupplementary motor area (sma) and dorsal premotor cortex bilaterally. the when-network consisted of superior sma together with insula and area 44 bilaterally as well as bilateral anterior putamen, globus pallidus, and left cerebellum subcortically. these 2 components recruited different networks, pointing to a partially distinct neuronal realization of the relating functions. finally, the more intentional components were involved, the higher was activity in the anterior midcingulate cortex, which highlighted its role in intentional initiation of behavior.
the ethics of community-based research with people who use drugs: results of a scoping review substance-using women who exchange sex for money, drugs or shelter as a means of basic subsistence (ie. survival sex) have remained largely at the periphery of hiv and harm reduction policies and services across canadian cities. this is notwithstanding global evidence of the multiple harms faced by this population, including high rates of violence and poverty, and enhanced vulnerabilities to hiv transmission among women who smoke or inject drugs. in response, a participatory-action research project was developed in partnership with a local sex work agency to examine the hiv-related vulnerabilities, barriers to accessing care, and impact of current prevention and harm reduction strategies among women in survival sex work. this paper provides a brief background of the health and drug-related harms among substance-using women in survival sex work, and outlines the development and methodology of a community-based hiv prevention research project partnership. in doing so, we discuss some of the strengths and challenges of community-based hiv prevention research, as well as some key ethical considerations, in the context of street-level sex work in an urban setting.
finite element modeling of short-wavelength folding on venus: implications for the plume hypothesis for crustal plateau formation crustal plateaus on venus constitute one of that planet’s most intriguing tectonic features. they host so-called “tessera” terrain, or deformed crust exhibiting two or more sets of intersecting tectonic lineaments, which comprises»8% of venus’ surface. major questions surrounding crustal plateaus and tessera terrain include: (1) what is the nature of crustal plateau deformation? what structures are present, and what are their spatial and temporal relations? (2) what is the global distribution of tessera terrain? does it form a global layer under the regional plains, cropping out in crustal plateaus, or is it confined to crustal plateaus? and (3) what are the implications of (1) and (2) for understanding the processes responsible for formation and deformation of crustal plateaus? structural and kinematic analyses reveal that deformation at ovda regio, venus largest crustal plateau, is characterized by linear shallow steep-sided troughs (ribbons), long arcuate long-wavelength folds, short mid-wavelength folds, and wide complex graben. temporal relations between structures lead to a three-phase regional strain history consisting of (1) layer-normal flattening of a thin competent membrane resulting in radially oriented, distributed extension (ribbon formation); (2) modest contraction of a thicker layer (concentric folding at plateau margins, interference folding in the plateau interior); and (3) limited extension localized at fold crests (graben formation). wavelength analysis of ribbons and folds places limits on the thickness of the competent layer during each stage of deformation and reflects an early shallow brittle‐ductile transition (bdt) that deepened with time. ovda’s deformation, topography, and gravity are all spatially correlated, strongly suggesting a genetic relationship between surface deformation and processes causing crustal thickening and plateau uplift. thus tessera terrain at ovda regio is likely confined to the topographically high plateau and does not extend beneath the surrounding regional plains. similar patterns persist at other crustal plateaus, indicating that tessera terrain is in general confined to crustal plateaus and does not form a globally continuous layer. ovda’s structures, their spatial and temporal relations, the resulting strain history, and the behavior of the bdt through time support a model of mantle plume upwelling in a thin lithospheric regime for crustal plateau formation and contradict previous downwelling models. similarities between structural and kinematic trends at ovda regio and other crustal plateaus lend support to this idea. c ∞ 1999 academic press
a three-dimensional (3d) organotypic microfluidic model for glioma stem cells - vascular interactions. metastatic cancer is regarded as one of the largest contributors to disease-related deaths worldwide. poor patient prognosis and treatment outcome is tied to the lack of efficacious anti-cancer therapies, which is due in part to the lack of physiologically relevant in vitro screening systems that can mimic the native tumor microenvironment. conventional drug-screening platforms, which are often used in the pharmaceutical industry, are either two-dimensional (2d) assays or three-dimensional (3d) hydrogel-based matrices that lack precise control over cell distribution, matrix architecture, and organization. despite the significance of in vivo models, they have limitations as it is difficult to control and analyze the influence of specific variables within their tumor microenvironment. thus, there is still a crucial need to develop tumor models that enable precise control of microenvironmental cues (e.g. matrix composition, soluble factors, cellular organization) to assess the efficacy of anti-cancer drugs. herein, we report the development and validation of a 3d microfluidic invasion platform for anti-cancer drug studies. our platform allowed for compartmentalization of tumor and stromal fibroblasts in a defined architecture, thereby enabling pharmacokinetic drug transport to a cell-dense tumor region. we analyzed the effect of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (saha), a histone deacetylase (hdac) inhibitor, on the behavior of sum159 breast cancer cells. many hdac inhibitors, including saha, have been a subject of controversy with highly conflicting results for the treatment of solid tumors in vitro as well as in clinical trials. we found that saha significantly inhibited cellular migration/proliferation, and decreased microtubule polarization.
reconstruction, classification, and segmentation for computational microscopy a novel graph theoretic approach for data clustering is presented and its application to the image segmentation problem is demonstrated. the data to be clustered are represented by an undirected adjacency graph g with arc capacities assigned to reflect the similarity between the linked vertices. clustering is achieved by removing arcs of g to form mutually exclusive subgraphs such that the largest inter-subgraph maximum flow is minimized. for graphs of moderate size ( approximately 2000 vertices), the optimal solution is obtained through partitioning a flow and cut equivalent tree of g, which can be efficiently constructed using the gomory-hu algorithm (1961). however for larger graphs this approach is impractical. new theorems for subgraph condensation are derived and are then used to develop a fast algorithm which hierarchically constructs and partitions a partially equivalent tree of much reduced size. this algorithm results in an optimal solution equivalent to that obtained by partitioning the complete equivalent tree and is able to handle very large graphs with several hundred thousand vertices. the new clustering algorithm is applied to the image segmentation problem. the segmentation is achieved by effectively searching for closed contours of edge elements (equivalent to minimum cuts in g), which consist mostly of strong edges, while rejecting contours containing isolated strong edges. this method is able to accurately locate region boundaries and at the same time guarantees the formation of closed edge contours. >
concise review of recent studies in vitiligo vitiligo is an acquired pigmentary disorder of unknown etiology that is clinically characterized by the development of white macules related to the selective loss of melanocytes. the prevalence of the disease is around 1% in the united states and in europe, but ranges from less than 0.1% to greater than 8% worldwide. a recorded predominance of women may reflect their greater willingness to express concern about cosmetically relevant issues. half of all patients develop the disease before 20 years of age. onset at an advanced age occurs but is unusual, and should raise concerns about associated diseases, such as thyroid dysfunction, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, and alopecia areata. generalized vitiligo is the most common clinical presentation and often involves the face and acral regions. the course of the disease is unpredictable and the response to treatment varies. depigmentation may be the source of severe psychological distress, diminished quality of life, and increased risk of psychiatric morbidity. part i of this two-part series describes the clinical presentation, histopathologic findings, and various hypotheses for the pathogenesis of vitiligo based on past and current research.
facet joint violation during pedicle screw insertion: a cadaveric study of the adult lumbosacral spine comparing the two pedicle screw insertion techniques twenty-one burst fractures of the thoracolumbar junction were stabilized with a transpedicular fixator by surgeons experienced in this technique. screws 5 or 6 mm in diameter were used. after the removal of the device 1 year postsurgery, axial ct scans were obtained of the instrumented vertebrae. eighty-two pedicles were examined. in 16 pedicles, medial or lateral cortical defects were found. five screws had intruded into the spinal canal by a maximum of 3.5 mm. in 48 pedicles a correlative comparison with the preoperative examinations was possible. compared with the dimensions of the pedicles on the preoperative ct scans, 31 had increased in width, and 14 showed deformation indicative of fractures of the lateral pedicle wall. when the screw diameter exceeded 65% of the pedicles' outer diameter, 85% of the pedicles expanded. one of four screws had penetrated the anterior wall of the vertebra. pedicle screw penetration on the left side above l2 poses potential risk of erosion of the aorta. the use of pedicle screws at the thoracolumbar junction by experienced surgeons carries some risk for malplacement and neurological damage. mismatch between pedicle dimension and screw size results in pedicle expansion and lateral wall fractures, probably during screw insertion. preoperative ct examinations should be used to help in choosing appropriate screw diameter presurgery.
cep290 interacts with the centriolar satellite component pcm-1 and is required for rab8 localization to the primary cilium. bbs4 is one of several proteins that cause bardet-biedl syndrome (bbs), a multisystemic disorder of genetic and clinical complexity. here we show that bbs4 localizes to the centriolar satellites of centrosomes and basal bodies of primary cilia, where it functions as an adaptor of the p150glued subunit of the dynein transport machinery to recruit pcm1 (pericentriolar material 1 protein) and its associated cargo to the satellites. silencing of bbs4 induces pcm1 mislocalization and concomitant deanchoring of centrosomal microtubules, arrest in cell division and apoptotic cell death. expression of two truncated forms of bbs4 that are similar to those found in some individuals with bbs had a similar effect on pcm1 and microtubules. our findings indicate that defective targeting or anchoring of pericentriolar proteins and microtubule disorganization contribute to the bbs phenotype and provide new insights into possible causes of familial obesity, diabetes and retinal degeneration.
higher education dominance and siloed knowledge: a systematic review of flipped classroom research recent calls for educational reform highlight ongoing concerns about the ability of current curricula to equip aspiring health care professionals with the skills for success. whereas a wide range of proposed solutions attempt to address apparent deficiencies in current educational models, a growing body of literature consistently points to the need to rethink the traditional in-class, lecture-based course model. one such proposal is the flipped classroom, in which content is offloaded for students to learn on their own, and class time is dedicated to engaging students in student-centered learning activities, like problem-based learning and inquiry-oriented strategies. in 2012, the authors flipped a required first-year pharmaceutics course at the university of north carolina eshelman school of pharmacy. they offloaded all lectures to self-paced online videos and used class time to engage students in active learning exercises. in this article, the authors describe the philosophy and methodology used to redesign the basic pharmaceutics ii course and outline the research they conducted to investigate the resulting outcomes. this article is intended to serve as a guide to instructors and educational programs seeking to develop, implement, and evaluate innovative and practical strategies to transform students’ learning experience. as class attendance, students’ learning, and the perceived value of this model all increased following participation in the flipped classroom, the authors conclude that this approach warrants careful consideration as educators aim to enhance learning, improve outcomes, and fully equip students to address 21st-century health care needs.
pathway of toll-like receptor 7/b cell activating factor/b cell activating factor receptor plays a role in immune thrombocytopenia in vivo increased levels of b lymphocyte stimulator (blys) are associated with systemic autoimmunity in animal models of spontaneous autoimmune disease, and transgenic animals expressing blys develop typical autoimmune disease. here, we demonstrate significant elevations of blys in the patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (sle). the blys isolated from the sera of sle patients had the same m.w. as the natural soluble form and was able to stimulate b cell activation in vitro. increased blys in sle patients was partially associated with higher levels of anti-dsdna ab of the igg, igm, and iga classes, but not associated with the disease activity. our results suggest that blys may be a useful marker for early activation of an autoimmune diathesis and likely plays a critical role in triggering activation of self-ag-driven autoimmune b cells in human sle. blys may provide an effective therapeutic target in systemic autoimmunity.
efficacy and safety of sunitinib on metastatic renal cell carcinoma: a single-institution experience background mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene vhl cause oversecretion of vascular endothelial growth factor by clear-cell renal carcinomas. we conducted a clinical trial to evaluate bevacizumab, a neutralizing antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor, in patients with metastatic renal-cell carcinoma.   methods a randomized, double-blind, phase 2 trial was conducted comparing placebo with bevacizumab at doses of 3 and 10 mg per kilogram of body weight, given every two weeks; the time to progression of disease and the response rate were primary end points. crossover from placebo to antibody treatment was allowed, and survival was a secondary end point.   results minimal toxic effects were seen, with hypertension and asymptomatic proteinuria predominating. the trial was stopped after the interim analysis met the criteria for early stopping. with 116 patients randomly assigned to treatment groups (40 to placebo, 37 to low-dose antibody, and 39 to high-dose antibody), there was a significant prolongation of the time to progression of disease in the high-dose--antibody group as compared with the placebo group (hazard ratio, 2.55; p<0.001). there was a small difference, of borderline significance, between the time to progression of disease in the low-dose--antibody group and that in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.26; p=0.053). the probability of being progression-free for patients given high-dose antibody, low-dose--antibody, and placebo was 64 percent, 39 percent, and 20 percent, respectively, at four months and 30 percent, 14 percent, and 5 percent at eight months. at the last analysis, there were no significant differences in overall survival between groups (p>0.20 for all comparisons).   conclusions bevacizumab can significantly prolong the time to progression of disease in patients with metastatic renal-cell cancer.
secondary metabolite profiling, growth profiles and other tools for species recognition and important aspergillus mycotoxins a secondary metabolite is a chemical compound produced by a limited number of fungal species in a genus, an order, or even phylum. a profile of secondary metabolites consists of all the different compounds a fungus can produce on a given substratum and includes toxins, antibiotics and other outward-directed compounds. chemotaxonomy is traditionally restricted to comprise fatty acids, proteins, carbohydrates, or secondary metabolites, but has sometimes been defined so broadly that it also includes dna sequences. it is not yet possible to use secondary metabolites in phylogeny, because of the inconsistent distribution throughout the fungal kingdom. however, this is the very quality that makes secondary metabolites so useful in classification and identification. four groups of organisms are particularly good producers of secondary metabolites: plants, fungi, lichen fungi, and actinomycetes, whereas yeasts, protozoa, and animals are less efficient producers. therefore, secondary metabolites have mostly been used in plant and fungal taxonomy, whereas chemotaxonomy has been neglected in bacteriology. lichen chemotaxonomy has been based on few biosynthetic families (chemosyndromes), whereas filamentous fungi have been analysed for a wide array of terpenes, polyketides, non-ribosomal peptides, and combinations of these. fungal chemotaxonomy based on secondary metabolites has been used successfully in large ascomycete genera such as alternaria, aspergillus, fusarium, hypoxylon, penicillium, stachybotrys, xylaria and in few basidiomycete genera, but not in zygomycota and chytridiomycota.
analytical evaluation of switching characteristics in five-phase drives with discontinuous space vector pulse width modulation techniques using an expanded reference frame transformation expressed in the complex-variable form, the possibilities offered by multi-phase converters, using carrier-based, sine-triangle pulse-width modulation to generate voltages of different frequencies to actuate multi-phase electric machines are set forth. the generalized expressions for the modulation signals, including the neutral voltage component to be compared with the high frequency triangle waveform to synthesize reference voltages for both five and six-phase converter-electric machines are determined. how the inclusion of the neutral voltage affects the modulation signals and the voltage gain and waveform quality is discussed. some experimental results of synthesized five phase converter voltage waveforms are provided to validate the voltage waveform synthesis using carrier-based generalized (dis)continuous pulse-width modulation for operation in both the under and over- modulation regimes.
allochthonous and autochthonous carbon sources for fish in floodplain lagoons of an australian dryland river the use of stable isotopes to solve biogeochemical problems in ecosystem analysis is increasing rapidly because stable isotope data can contribute both source-sink (tracer) and process information: the elements c, n, s, h, and all have more than one isotope, and isotopic compositions of natural materials can be measured with great precision with a mass spectrometer. isotopic compositions change in predictable ways as elements cycle through the biosphere. these changes have been exploited by geochemists to understand the global elemental cycles. ecologists have not until quite recently employed these techniques. the reasons for this are, first, that most ecologists do not have the background in chemistry and geochemistry to be fully aware of the possibilities for exploiting the natural variations in stable isotopic compositions, and second, that stable isotope ratio measurements require equipment not normally available to ecologists. this is unfortunate because some of the more intractable problems in ecology can be profitably addressed using stable isotope measurements. stable isotopes are ideally suited to increase our understanding of element cycles in ecosystems. this review is written for ecologists who would like to learn more about how stable isotope analyses have been and can be used in ecosystem studies. we begin with an explanation of isotope terminology and fractionation, then summarize isotopic distributions in the c, n, and s biogeochemical cycles, and conclude with five case studies that show how stable isotope measurements can provide crucial information for ecosystem analysis. we restrict this review to studies of natural variations in c, n, and s isotopic abundances, cxcluding from consideration ~5n enrichment studies and hydrogen and oxygen isotope studies. our focus on c, n, and s derives in part from our
cell-mediated immune responses in tuberculosis. il-17 is a cytokine that induces neutrophil-mediated inflammation, but its role in protective immunity against intracellular bacterial infection remains unclear. in the present study, we demonstrate that il-17 is an important cytokine not only in the early neutrophil-mediated inflammatory response, but also in t cell-mediated ifn-γ production and granuloma formation in response to pulmonary infection by mycobacterium bovis bacille calmette-guérin (bcg). il-17 expression in the bcg-infected lung was detected from the first day after infection and the expression depended on il-23. our observations indicated that γδ t cells are a primary source of il-17. lung-infiltrating t cells of il-17-deficient mice produced less ifn-γ in comparison to those from wild-type mice 4 wk after bcg infection. impaired granuloma formation was also observed in the infected lungs of il-17-deficient mice, which is consistent with the decreased delayed-type hypersensitivity response of the infected mice against mycobacterial ag. these data suggest that il-17 is an important cytokine in the induction of optimal th1 response and protective immunity against mycobacterial infection.
frequency-dependent modes of synaptic vesicle endocytosis and exocytosis at adult mouse neuromuscular junctions this paper compares the activity of hindlimb motor units from muscles mainly composed of fast-twitch muscle fibers (medial and lateral gastrocnemius: mg/lg, tibialis anterior: ta) to motor units from a muscle mainly composed of slow-twitch muscle fibers (soleus: sol) during unrestrained walking in the conscious rat. several differences in the activation profiles of motor units from these two groups of muscles were observed. for example, motor units from fast muscles (e.g., mg/lg and ta) fired at very high mean frequencies of discharge, ranging from 60 to 100 hz, and almost always were recruited with initial doublets or triplets, i.e., initial frequencies >/=100 hz. in contrast, the majority of sol units fired at much lower mean rates of discharge, approximately 30 hz, and had initial frequencies of only 30-60 hz (i.e., there were no initial doublets/triplets >/=100 hz). thus the presence of initial doublet or triplets was dependent on the intrinsic properties of the motor unit, i.e., faster units were recruited with a doublet/triplet more often than slower units. moreover, in contrast to units from the slow sol muscle, the activity of single motor units from the fast mg/lg muscle, especially units recruited midway or near the end of a locomotor burst, was unrelated to the activity of the remainder of the motoneuron pool, as measured by the corresponding gross-electromyographic (emg) signal. this dissociation of activity was suggested to arise from a compartmentalized recruitment of the mg/lg motoneuron pool by the rhythm-generating networks of the spinal cord. in contrast, when comparing the rate modulation of simultaneously recorded motor units within a single lg muscle compartment, the frequency profiles of unit pairs were modulated in a parallel fashion. this suggested that the parent motoneurons were responsive to changes in synaptic inputs during unrestrained walking, unlike the poor rate modulation that occurs during locomotion induced from brain stem stimulation. in summary, data from this study provide evidence that the firing behavior of motor units during unrestrained walking is influenced by both the intrinsic properties of the parent motoneuron and by synaptic inputs from the locomotor networks of the spinal cord. in addition, it also provides the first extensive description of motor-unit activity from different muscles during unrestrained walking in the conscious rat.
the association between individual snps or haplotypes of matrix metalloproteinase 1 and gastric cancer susceptibility, progression and prognosis purpose matrix metalloproteinase-1 (mmp-1) is likely to be involved in invasion and metastasis of several tumors by degrading the extracellular matrix. a single guanine insertion polymorphism (2g) in the mmp-1 promoter region creates an ets binding site causing the elevation of transcriptional level and local expression of mmp-1. the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of this 2g insertion type polymorphism on invasion and metastasis of colorectal cancer (crc).   experimental design we genotyped for this 1g/2g polymorphism 60 patients, who were operated on for crc and followed for 6-30 months (median: 21). a control population of 164 age- and sex-matched tumor-free subjects was also genotyped for the same polymorphism.   results the proportion of 2g homozygotes was higher in the crc group than in the controls (p = 0.014; odds ratio, 2.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-4.16). the crc group was divided in a group without metastasis (m-) and a group that had developed metastasis (m+). at the time of diagnosis, 2g homozygotes were more represented in the m+ group than in m- (p = 0.0082; odds ratio, 4.73; 95% confidence interval, 1.46-15.26). the difference between m- patients and controls did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.52).   conclusions our results suggest that the presence of 2g polymorphism at the mmp-1 promoter region may favor the growth and the metastatic process in crc patients and could be looked at as a risk factor for a worse prognosis.
cep290 interacts with the centriolar satellite component pcm-1 and is required for rab8 localization to the primary cilium. bbs4 is one of several proteins that cause bardet-biedl syndrome (bbs), a multisystemic disorder of genetic and clinical complexity. here we show that bbs4 localizes to the centriolar satellites of centrosomes and basal bodies of primary cilia, where it functions as an adaptor of the p150glued subunit of the dynein transport machinery to recruit pcm1 (pericentriolar material 1 protein) and its associated cargo to the satellites. silencing of bbs4 induces pcm1 mislocalization and concomitant deanchoring of centrosomal microtubules, arrest in cell division and apoptotic cell death. expression of two truncated forms of bbs4 that are similar to those found in some individuals with bbs had a similar effect on pcm1 and microtubules. our findings indicate that defective targeting or anchoring of pericentriolar proteins and microtubule disorganization contribute to the bbs phenotype and provide new insights into possible causes of familial obesity, diabetes and retinal degeneration.
genetic studies of complex human diseases: characterizing snp-disease associations using bayesian networks summary. we consider the problem of comparing complex hierarchical models in which the number of parameters is not clearly defined. using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure pd for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. in general pd approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the ‘hat’ matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. its properties in exponential families are explored. the posterior mean deviance is suggested as a bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. adding pd to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. the procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative bayesian and classical proposals. throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a markov chain monte carlo analysis.
rheumatologic emergencies background: primary cns vasculitis (pcnsv) is an uncommon disease in which lesions are limited to the brain and spinal cord. our objective was to evaluate the frequency, clinical features, and outcome of spinal cord involvement in pcnsv. methods: we retrospectively identified 101 consecutive patients with pcnsv. spinal cord involvement was documented for five. clinical findings, laboratory studies, and outcomes of patients with spinal cord involvement were assessed and compared with those without spinal cord manifestations. results: spinal cord symptoms developed before cerebral symptoms in one patient, concurrently in two, and after cerebral symptoms in two. cns biopsy specimens showed necrotizing vasculitis in three patients and granulomatous vasculitis in two. mri of the spinal cord showed enhanced thoracic lesions in all five. cerebral angiograms from four patients had normal findings. one patient had a fatal clinical course. the other four had relapses during follow-up but responded well to therapy and had favorable overall outcomes. at the last follow-up (median, 19 months after diagnosis), the four patients had recovered with slight or moderate residual disability. no significant differences in clinical and laboratory features were observed when comparing patients with or without spinal cord involvement. cerebral angiograms with evidence of vasculitis were significantly more frequent for patients without spinal cord involvement (p = 0.002). conclusion: spinal cord involvement was documented in 5% of patients with primary cns vasculitis. the thoracic cord was the predominantly affected site. other than myelopathy, clinical characteristics were similar to those of the patients without spinal cord involvement. glossary: atm = acute transverse myelitis; esr = erythrocyte sedimentation rate; nd = no data; pcnsv = primary cns vasculitis; wbc = white blood cells.
the mechanism of decrease in dynamic mitral regurgitation during heart failure treatment: importance of reduction in the regurgitant orifice size. the proximal flow convergence method, a quantitative color doppler flow technique, has been validated recently for calculating regurgitant flow and orifice area. we investigated the potential of the method as a tool to study different pathophysiological mechanisms of mitral valve incompetence by assessing the time course of regurgitant flow and orifice area and analyzed the implications for quantification of mitral regurgitation. methods and resultsfifty-six consecutive patients with mitral regurgitation of different etiologies were studied. the instantaneous regurgitant flow rate q(t) was computed from color m-mode recordings of the proximal flow convergence region and divided by the corresponding orifice velocity v(t) to obtain the instantaneous orifice area at). regurgitant stroke volume (rsv) was obtained by integrating q(t). mean regurgitant flow rate qm was calculated by rsv divided by regurgitation time. peak-to-mean regurgitant flow rates qp/qm and orifice areas a(p)/am were calculated to assess the phasic character of qt)and a(t). in the first 24 patients (group 1), computation of qm and rsv from the color doppler recordings was compared with the conventional pulsed doppler method (r = .94, see=29.4 ml/s and r = .95, see=9.7 ml) as well as with angiography (r,=.93 and r,=.94, p < .001). the temporal variation of q(t) and a(t) was studied in the next 32 patients (group 2): in functional regurgitation in dilated cardiomyopathy (n= 12), there was a constant decrease in at) throughout systole with an increase during left ventricular relaxation; ap/am was 5.49±3.17. in mitral valve prolapse n=6), a(t) was small in early systole, increasing substantially in midsystole, and decreasing mildly during left ventricular relaxation; ap/am was 2.48±0.26. in rheumatic mitral regurgitation n= 14), a roughly constant regurgitant orifice area during most of systole was found in 4 patients. in the other patients there was significant variation of ast) and the time of its maximum; ap/am was 1.81 ±0.56. anova demonstrated that the differences in ap/am were related to the etiology of mitral regurgitation (p < .0001). to verify that the calculated variation in regurgitant orifice area during the cardiac cycle reflects an actual variation, the ability of the method to predict a constant orifice area throughout systole was tested experimentally in a canine model of mitral regurgitation. five flow stages were produced by implanting fixed grommet orifices of different sizes into the anterior mitral leaflet. a constant regurgitant orifice area was correctly predicted throughout systole with a mean percent error of −1.8±4% (from −6.9% to ±5.8%); the standard deviation of the individual curves calculated at 10% intervals during systole averaged 13.3% (from 3.6% to 19.6%). in addition, functional mitral regurgitation caused by ventricular dysfunction was produced pharmacologically in five dogs, and the color m-mode recordings of the proximal flow convergence region were obtained with the transducer placed directly on the heart instead of the chest, thus ruling out a significant effect of translational motion on the observed flow pattern. the pattern of regurgitant flow variation was identical to that observed in patients. conclusionsthe proximal flow convergence method demonstrates that regurgitant flow and orifice area vary throughout systole in distinct patterns characteristic of the underlying mechanism of mitral incompetence. therefore, in addition to the potential of the method as a tool to quantify mitral regurgitation, it allows analysis of the pathophysiology of regurgitation in the individual patient, which may be helpful in clinical decision making. calculating mitral regurgitant flow rate and volume from the time-varying proximal flow field (ie, without assuming a constant orifice area that would produce overestimation in individual patients) provides excellent agreement with independent techniques and agrees well with angiography.
the second wave of the controlled antenatal thyroid screening (cats ii) study: the cognitive assessment protocol objective the purpose of this study was to determine whether routine screening for subclinical hypothyroidism during pregnancy would be cost-effective.   study design we developed a decision analysis model to compare the cost-effectiveness of 2 screening strategies during pregnancy for subclinical hypothyroidism: (1) no routine screening of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) levels (standard) and (2) routine screening of tsh levels. in the latter, women with subclinical hypothyroidism received thyroid hormone replacement. we assumed that thyroid hormone replacement could reduce the incidence of an offspring iq < 85 for pregnancies with subclinical hypothyroidism. the main outcome measure was marginal cost per quality-adjusted life year (qaly) gained.   results our model predicts that universal screening is the dominant strategy. for every 100,000 pregnant women who were screened, $8,356,383 are saved, and 589.3 qalys are gained. when subclinical hypothyroidism prevalence is reduced to 0.25%, screening remains cost-effective at $21,664/qaly gained.   conclusion screening for subclinical hypothyroidism in pregnancy will be a cost-effective strategy under a wide range of circumstances.
molecular analysis of spinal muscular atrophy: a genotyping protocol based on taqman® real-time pcr abstract. spinal muscular atrophy (sma) is one of the most common autosomal recessive diseases, affecting approximately 1 in 10,000 live births, and with a carrier frequency of approximately 1 in 50. because of gene deletion or conversion, smn1 exon 7 is homozygously absent in approximately 94% of patients with clinically typical sma. approximately 30 small intragenic smn1 mutations have also been described. these mutations are present in many of the approximately 6% of sma patients who do not lack both copies of smn1, whereas sma of other patients without a homozygous absence of smn1 is unrelated to smn1. a commonly used polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) assay can be used to detect a homozygous absence of smn1 exon 7. smn gene dosage analyses, which can determine the copy numbers of smn1 and smn2 (an smn1 homolog and a modifier for sma), have been developed for sma carrier testing and to confirm that smn1 is heterozygously absent in symptomatic individuals who do not lack both copies of smn1. in conjunction with smn gene dosage analysis, linkage analysis remains an important component of sma genetic testing in certain circumstances. genetic risk assessment is an essential and integral component of sma genetic testing and impacts genetic counseling both before and after genetic testing is performed. comprehensive sma genetic testing, comprising pcr-rflp assay, smn gene dosage analysis, and linkage analysis, combined with appropriate genetic risk assessment and genetic counseling, offers the most complete evaluation of sma patients and their families at this time. new technologies, such as haploid analysis techniques, may be widely available in the future.
screening for body dysmorphic disorder in a dermatology outpatient setting at a tertiary care centre learning objectives: after studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. identify the diagnostic criteria and clinical features of body dysmorphic disorder. 2. describe the prevalence of body dysmorphic disorder in cosmetic populations. 3. identify appropriate treatment strategies for body dysmorphic disorder. background: body dysmorphic disorder is a relatively common psychiatric disorder among persons who seek cosmetic surgical and minimally invasive treatments. methods: this article reviews the history of the diagnosis and the current diagnostic criteria. etiologic theories, clinical and demographic characteristics, and comorbidity, including the relationship of body dysmorphic disorder to obsessive-compulsive spectrum and impulse control disorders, are discussed. the prevalence of body dysmorphic disorder in cosmetic populations is highlighted. treatments for body dysmorphic disorder, including medical, psychiatric, and psychological interventions, are reviewed. results: body dysmorphic disorder is an often severe, impairing disorder. among patients presenting for cosmetic treatments, 7 to 15 percent may suffer from the condition. retrospective outcome studies suggest that persons with body dysmorphic disorder typically do not benefit from cosmetic procedures. pharmacotherapy and cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy, in contrast, appear to be effective treatments for body dysmorphic disorder. conclusions: because of the frequency with which persons with body dysmorphic disorder pursue cosmetic procedures, providers of cosmetic surgical and minimally invasive treatments may be able to identify and refer these patients for appropriate mental health care. directions for future research are suggested.
particle simulation approach for subcellular dynamics and interactions of biological molecules adaptors are modular proteins implicated in the orchestration of intracellular signalling pathways. studies of adaptors specifically expressed in immune cells have provided clear examples of the importance of adaptor molecules in normal mammalian biology. moreover, they have led to the identification of naturally occurring mutations in adaptors that can be linked to human diseases. lastly, they have highlighted the plasticity of protein-protein interaction modules, and have shed light onto the mechanisms dictating the specificity of adaptor-mediated signals.
markers of lutein and zeaxanthin status in two age groups of men and women: dietary intake, serum concentrations, lipid profile and macular pigment optical density age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in the elderly, is a degenerative condition of the macula characterized by death or dysfunction of the photoreceptors. with the aging population growing, the incidence of age-related macular degeneration is expected to increase. this raises concern about the future of visual dysfunction related falls and the resulting injuries in the elderly population. lutein and zeaxanthin are macular pigments that may play a role in reducing the development and progression of age-related macular degeneration. evidence is accumulating on the consumption of lutein and zeaxanthin (in whole food or supplemental form), the resulting concentrations in the serum, and tissue distribution throughout the body, particularly in the retina. lutein and zeaxanthin intake increases serum concentrations which in turn increases macular pigment density. existing literature focuses on factors affecting macular pigment density, functions of lutein and zeaxanthin as blue-light filters and antioxidants, and risk factors associated with age-related macular degeneration. few studies have focused on the impact of dietary lutein and zeaxanthin on retinal function and the potential to preserve vision and prevent further degeneration. this presents an opportunity for further research to determine an effective dose that delays the progression of age-related macular degeneration.
global stability analysis of competitive neural networks with mixed time-varying delays and discontinuous neuron activations this paper introduces a general class of neural networks with arbitrary constant delays in the neuron interconnections, and neuron activations belonging to the set of discontinuous monotone increasing and (possibly) unbounded functions. the discontinuities in the activations are an ideal model of the situation where the gain of the neuron amplifiers is very high and tends to infinity, while the delay accounts for the finite switching speed of the neuron amplifiers, or the finite signal propagation speed. it is known that the delay in combination with high-gain nonlinearities is a particularly harmful source of potential instability. the goal of this paper is to single out a subclass of the considered discontinuous neural networks for which stability is instead insensitive to the presence of a delay. more precisely, conditions are given under which there is a unique equilibrium point of the neural network, which is globally exponentially stable for the states, with a known convergence rate. the conditions are easily testable and independent of the delay. moreover, global convergence in finite time of the state and output is investigated. in doing so, new interesting dynamical phenomena are highlighted with respect to the case without delay, which make the study of convergence in finite time significantly more difficult. the obtained results extend previous work on global stability of delayed neural networks with lipschitz continuous neuron activations, and neural networks with discontinuous neuron activations but without delays.
the mechanisms of detoxification of as(iii), dimethylarsinic acid (dma) and as(v) in the microalga chlorella vulgaris. the synthesis of phytochelatins (pcs) in a marine alga, dunalliela tertiolecta, is strongly induced by zn. pretreatment of the cells with zn enhances the tolerance toward toxic heavy metals such as cd, hg, cu, pb, and arsenate. moreover, the pretreatment also increases the tolerance toward oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide or paraquat. in vitro analysis shows that pc is a stronger scavenger of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radical than glutathione. these results suggest that pcs inducibly synthesized by zn treatment could play a role not only in detoxification of heavy metals but also in mitigation of oxidative stress.
descriptor ensemble: an unsupervised approach to descriptor fusion in the homography space in this paper, we compare the performance of descriptors computed for local interest regions, as, for example, extracted by the harris-affine detector [mikolajczyk, k and schmid, c, 2004]. many different descriptors have been proposed in the literature. it is unclear which descriptors are more appropriate and how their performance depends on the interest region detector. the descriptors should be distinctive and at the same time robust to changes in viewing conditions as well as to errors of the detector. our evaluation uses as criterion recall with respect to precision and is carried out for different image transformations. we compare shape context [belongie, s, et al., april 2002], steerable filters [freeman, w and adelson, e, setp. 1991], pca-sift [ke, y and sukthankar, r, 2004], differential invariants [koenderink, j and van doorn, a, 1987], spin images [lazebnik, s, et al., 2003], sift [lowe, d. g., 1999], complex filters [schaffalitzky, f and zisserman, a, 2002], moment invariants [van gool, l, et al., 1996], and cross-correlation for different types of interest regions. we also propose an extension of the sift descriptor and show that it outperforms the original method. furthermore, we observe that the ranking of the descriptors is mostly independent of the interest region detector and that the sift-based descriptors perform best. moments and steerable filters show the best performance among the low dimensional descriptors.
screening for inhalational anthrax due to bioterrorism: evaluating proposed screening protocols. context in the event of a bioterrorist attack, it may be difficult to distinguish inhalational anthrax from viral respiratory tract disease. contribution this synthesis compares reported symptoms of 28 patients with inhalational anthrax and 4694 patients with viral respiratory tract illnesses. fever and cough were common in both infections. mental confusion or loss of consciousness, shortness of breath, and nausea and vomiting more often indicated anthrax, whereas sore throat and runny nose more often indicated viral infection. implications several symptoms, including neurologic and gastrointestinal symptoms and shortness of breath, may help distinguish inhalational anthrax from respiratory viral illness. the editors the 2001 anthrax attacks in the united states, in which 11 people developed the inhalational form of the disease and 5 died, exposed a weakness in the u.s. medical response to bioterrorism (1). despite heroic efforts on behalf of the victims, physicians were largely unprepared to recognize the early symptoms and signs of this extremely rare and rapidly progressive infection in ambulatory patients (2). initially, 4 of the 11 patients were sent home after being seen as outpatients or in an emergency department with diagnoses that included viral syndrome, bronchitis, and gastroenteritis (3, 4). physicians first considered a diagnosis of anthrax in 2 of these patients (both postal workers) on their second visits to the emergency department and then only after hearing media reports of illness among other postal employees (3). inhalation of anthrax spores leads to clinical disease from elaboration of two toxins, a calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase known as edema factor and a zinc metalloproteinase called lethal factor, by phagocytosed bacteria in the mediastinal lymph nodes and bloodstream (5). classic pathologic findings include hemorrhagic mediastinitis and hemorrhagic meningitis; primary anthrax pneumonia is rare (6, 7). without prompt treatment, death occurs rapidly from a combination of shock and respiratory compromise. anthrax has been classified by the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention as one of six category a bioterrorist agents posing the greatest risk to civilian populations (8). a large-scale anthrax attack has the potential to cause casualties on a scale that would quickly overwhelm local and regional health care treatment capacity (6). the emergency response to such an attack would probably include the establishment of multiple mass prophylaxis centers physically distinct from hospital emergency departments (to prevent overcrowding and potential contamination) for rapid dispensing of prophylactic antibiotics to exposed populations and for identifying individuals suspected of having inhalational anthrax (9). presumptive cases would be transferred to established or temporary medical care facilities for rapid definitive testing and initiation of combination antimicrobial treatment, which may improve outcomes (10-12). efficient management of this limited medical care capacity is an important secondary goal of outpatient triage during a bioterrorism response (13, 14). screening and triage protocols used in these settings would need to rely on presenting symptoms and signs because laboratory or radiographic testing will probably not be feasible in high-volume mass prophylaxis centers (15). we sought to establish an evidence base for developing a screening protocol for inhalational anthrax. the utility of such a protocol, which improves both case detection and case exclusion, would also extend beyond the immediate mass prophylaxis setting because large numbers of individuals outside the exposure zone will probably seek reassurance from health care providers for symptomatic illnesses in the aftermath of a major attack. providing scientific evidence on which to base these discussions may decrease postattack anxiety and inappropriate utilization of health care resources (16). methods clinical data on the 11 inhalational anthrax cases of 2001 are now widely available (3, 4, 17-20). because of the small number of cases in the contemporary attack, we performed a systematic literature review to identify additional original case reports of inhalational anthrax in the english-language medical literature. we searched two computerized databases (medline and web of science) for adult human case reports of anthrax infection between 1960 and 2000 using the keywords anthrax and case report. this yielded 44 references; 4 contained sufficient clinical data on inhalational anthrax to permit comparison with the 11 contemporary cases (21-24). tracing bibliographies of these articles and a recent review article (25) produced an additional 7 articles that were appropriate for inclusion, for a total of 11 reports on 17 cases (26-32). two of the cases involved patients from outside of the united states (22, 24). we interpreted lack of mention of a specific symptom or abnormal sign in these reports as indicating the absence of that finding from the patient's clinical presentation. we compared proportions of symptoms and signs in historical and contemporary cases using the fisher exact test; clinical features that had consistent prevalence rates in earlier and contemporary cases were candidates for comparison with viral respiratory tract disease. viral respiratory tract infections, such as with influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), parainfluenza, and rhinoviruses or coronaviruses, are appropriate comparison conditions for this study because of their prevalence and potential similarity to inhalational anthrax (15, 33). we searched medline for descriptive epidemiologic reports of presenting clinical features of laboratory-confirmed influenza and noninfluenza viral respiratory illnesses in ambulatory adults; we found five published studies that met the search criteria (34-38). we did not include studies that describe samples of mixed influenza and noninfluenza cases (39-42) or that present data already reported in these five studies (43). we did not compare anthrax cases with asymptomatic persons (because they would not present a screening dilemma) or with acutely ill patients (because they would probably not participate in mass screening). since there are no reports of inhalational anthrax in pediatric patients, we limited our comparison sample to adult patients. finally, we also compared anthrax cases to ambulatory patients with community-acquired pneumonia to highlight the difficulty of distinguishing these two conditions (44). we calculated positive likelihood ratios with 95% cis for the presence of selected signs and symptoms in inhalational anthrax versus influenza, influenza-like illness, and ambulatory community-acquired pneumonia. the positive likelihood ratio is defined here as the prevalence of a symptom or sign among inhalational anthrax cases divided by the prevalence of the same symptom or sign in the influenza, influenza-like illness, or pneumonia comparison groups. the positive likelihood ratio is the multiplicative factor that increases or decreases the odds of having inhalational anthrax as opposed to one of these comparison diseases, given the presence of a clinical finding (45). therefore, the post-test probability of having inhalational anthrax is influenced by both the magnitude of the positive likelihood ratio and the pretest probability of having the disease (46). in the appropriate clinical setting (that is, when the pretest probability of having the target disease is not zero), likelihood ratios greater than 3 or less than 0.3 are considered clinically important (47). the general approach used heredeveloping diagnostic algorithms for rare diagnoses by using likelihood ratios and by establishing hypothetical comparison groups populated by common medical conditionshas been previously described (46, 48, 49). the study sponsors had no role in the design, conduct, and reporting of the data or in the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. results presenting symptoms and signs and radiographic results for the 11 deliberately infected contemporary cases and 17 occupationally or environmentally infected historical cases were similar, although contemporary patients reported significantly more fever/chills and fatigue or malaise (table 1). all but 1 of the 28 patients (including 100% of the contemporary patients) had fever, chills, or cough on presentation. (the single exception was a patient who presented with impending shock, which limited the ability to record a complete history.) other symptoms that affected more than half of all patients included dyspnea (68%), chest discomfort or pain (61%), and nausea or vomiting (61%). more than half of current case-patients and 43% of the combined sample presented with neurologic symptoms other than headache, including confusion, blurred vision, and dizziness. only a few patients with inhalational anthrax reported sore throat (18%) or rhinorrhea (14%). table 1. summary of symptoms and signs at initial presentation: historical versus contemporary patients with inhalational anthrax eighty-one percent of patients presented with abnormalities on lung auscultation, including rales or rhonchi (65%) and dullness or decreased breath sounds (58%). respiratory symptoms often did not match findings on lung physical examination. four of the five patients with no respiratory symptoms had positive findings (rales), whereas 8 of the 23 patients with respiratory symptoms had no abnormality on lung examination. outcomes differed significantly between historical and contemporary patients: 16 of the 17 historical patients died compared with only 5 of the 11 contemporary patients. the presenting clinical features of the 28 patients can be divided into nine symptom complexes involving respiratory; gastrointestinal; ear, nose, and throat; and nonheadache neurologic problems (figure 1). the single most common presentation was a combination of respirato
relationship between hyperemesis gravidarum and small-for-gestational-age in the japanese population: the japan environment and children’s study (jecs) objective to study perinatal outcomes in pregnancies complicated by hyperemesis gravidarum (hg) as compared to controls.   study design between 1984 and 1991, 138 patients were diagnosed with hg according to fairweather's criteria. subjects were stratified into groups of mild and severe hg according to the presence of at least one of the following criteria: ketonuria, increased blood urea nitrogen and hematocrit, and/or abnormal electrolytes. all patients without hg on whom records were available and who delivered during the study period were included as controls. multiple gestations and stillbirths were excluded from the analysis. student's t test and x2 were used for statistical analysis.   results demographic data were not significantly different between the groups. forty patients were diagnosed as having mild hg and 98 patients as having severe; 12,335 patients were defined as controls. mean fetal birth weights were 3,110, 3,093, and 3,160 g in the mild, severe and control groups, respectively. the incidence of congenital anomalies was 2.5%, 2.0% and 1.6%, respectively. the incidence of prematurity was 17.5%, 11.2% and 10.7% in mild and severe hg and controls, respectively. none of the outcome variables for mild or severe hg were significantly different as compared to the controls. differences in other neonatal outcomes, including frequency of five-minute apgar score < 7 and neonatal intensive care unit admissions, were not significantly different between the three groups.   conclusion in contrast to previous reports, this study demonstrated that fetuses of gravidas admitted for hg are not at increased risk of growth retardation, congenital anomalies or prematurity. no beneficial effect on pregnancy outcome was detected.
kicking out the trolls - antecedents of social exclusion intentions in facebook groups we investigated how intentions to hide and unfriend facebook contacts were linked to perceived sender attractiveness and face-threating messages (ftas). intention to hide was higher than intention to unfriend contacts, implying that unfriending is harsher. low social attractiveness predicted hiding and unfriending intentions, but low physical attractiveness was only linked to hiding. disrespectful messages were linked to hiding contacts, while updates that made the receiver look bad were linked to unfriending. ftas also mediated the influence of social and physical attractiveness on hiding and unfriending contacts. overall, managing online relationships relied on independent and interdependent perceptual and behavioral processes.
interaction of human arylamine n-acetyltransferase 1 with different nanomaterials arylamine n-acetyltransferases (ec 2.3.1.5) (nats) catalyse the biotransformation of many primary arylamines, hydrazines and their n-hydroxylated metabolites, thereby playing an important role in both the detoxification and metabolic activation of numerous xenobiotics. the recently published crystal structure of the salmonella typhimurium nat (stnat) revealed the existence of a cysteine protease-like (cys-his-asp) catalytic triad. in the present study, a three-dimensional homology model of human nat1, based upon the crystal structure of stnat [sinclair, sandy, delgoda, sim and noble (2000) nat. struct. biol. 7, 560-564], is demonstrated. alignment of stnat and nat1, together with secondary structure predictions, have defined a consensus region (residues 29-131) in which 37% of the residues are conserved. homology modelling provided a good quality model of the corresponding region in human nat1. the location of the catalytic triad was found to be identical in stnat and nat1. comparison of active-site structural elements revealed that a similar length loop is conserved in both species (residues 122-131 in nat1 model and residues 122-133 in stnat). this observation may explain the involvement of residues 125, 127 and 129 in human nat substrate selectivity. our model, and the fact that cysteine protease inhibitors do not affect the activity of nat1, suggests that human nats may have adapted a common catalytic mechanism from cysteine proteases to accommodate it for acetyl-transfer reactions.
a deep learning approach to detect snp interactions comprehensive high-resolution structural maps are central to functional exploration and understanding in biology. for the nervous system, in which high resolution and large spatial extent are both needed, such maps are scarce as they challenge data acquisition and analysis capabilities. here we present for the mouse inner plexiform layer—the main computational neuropil region in the mammalian retina—the dense reconstruction of 950 neurons and their mutual contacts. this was achieved by applying a combination of crowd-sourced manual annotation and machine-learning-based volume segmentation to serial block-face electron microscopy data. we characterize a new type of retinal bipolar interneuron and show that we can subdivide a known type based on connectivity. circuit motifs that emerge from our data indicate a functional mechanism for a known cellular response in a ganglion cell that detects localized motion, and predict that another ganglion cell is motion sensitive.
alternative interventions to prevent oxidative damage following ischemia/reperfusion oxidative stress is considered a major contributor to etiology of both “normal” senescence and severe pathologies with serious public health implications. mitochondria generate reactive oxygen species (ros) that are thought to augment intracellular oxidative stress. mitochondria possess at least nine known sites that are capable of generating superoxide anion, a progenitor ros. mitochondria also possess numerous ros defense systems that are much less studied. studies of the last three decades shed light on many important mechanistic details of mitochondrial ros production, but the bigger picture remains obscure. this review summarizes the current knowledge about major components involved in mitochondrial ros metabolism and factors that regulate ros generation and removal. an integrative, systemic approach is applied to analysis of mitochondrial ros metabolism, which is now dissected into mitochondrial ros production, mitochondrial ros removal, and mitochondrial ros emission. it is suggested that mitochondria augment intracellular oxidative stress due primarily to failure of their ros removal systems, whereas the role of mitochondrial ros emission is yet to be determined and a net increase in mitochondrial ros production in situ remains to be demonstrated.
uv-b signaling pathways and fluence rate dependent transcriptional regulation of ariadne12. constitutively photomorphogenic1 (cop1) is a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis in arabidopsis thaliana. cop1 functions as an e3 ubiquitin ligase, targeting select proteins for proteasomal degradation in plants as well as in mammals. among its substrates is the basic domain/leucine zipper (bzip) transcription factor elongated hypocotyl5 (hy5), one of the key regulators of photomorphogenesis under all light qualities, including uv-b responses required for tolerance to this environmental threat. here, we report that, in contrast with the situation in visible light, cop1 is a critical positive regulator of responses to low levels of uv-b. we show that in the cop1-4 mutant, flavonoid accumulation and genome-wide expression changes in response to uv-b are blocked to a large extent. cop1 is required for hy5 gene activation, and both cop1 and hy5 proteins accumulate in the nucleus under supplementary uv-b. suppressor of phytochrome a-105 family proteins (spa1 to spa4) that are required for cop1 function in dark and visible light are not essential in the response to uv-b. we conclude that cop1 performs a specific and novel role in the plants' photomorphogenic response to uv-b, coordinating hy5-dependent and -independent pathways, which eventually results in uv-b tolerance.
actigraph accelerometer-defined boundaries for sedentary behaviour and physical activity intensities in 7 year old children objective this study was designed to validate accelerometer-based activity monitors against energy expenditure (ee) in children; to compare monitor placement sites; to field-test the monitors; and to establish sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous threshold counts.   research methods and procedures computer science and applications actigraph (csa) and mini-mitter actiwatch (mm) monitors, on the hip or lower leg, were validated and calibrated against 6-hour ee measurements by room respiration calorimetry, activity by microwave detector, and heart rate by telemetry in 26 children, 6 to 16 years old. during the 6 hours, the children performed structured activities, including resting metabolic rate (rmr), nintendo, arts and crafts, aerobic warm-up, tae bo, treadmill walking and running, and games. activity energy expenditure (aee) computed as ee - rmr was regressed against counts to derive threshold counts.   results the mean correlations between ee or aee and counts were slightly higher for mm-hip (r = 0.78 +/- 0.06) and mm-leg (r = 0.80 +/- 0.05) than csa-hip (r = 0.66 +/- 0.08) and csa-leg (r = 0.73 +/- 0.07). csa and mm performed similarly on the hip (inter-instrument r = 0.88) and on the lower leg (inter-instrument r = 0.89). threshold counts for the csa-hip were <800, <3200, <8200, and > or = 8200 for sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous categories, respectively. for the mm-hip, the threshold counts were <100, <900, <2200, and > or = 2200, respectively.   discussion the validation of the csa and mm monitors against aee and their calibration for sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous thresholds certify these monitors as valid, useful devices for the assessment of physical activity in children.
lox-1 and tlr4 affect each other and regulate the generation of ros in a. fumigatus keratitis. the recognition of microbial pathogens by the innate immune system involves toll-like receptors (tlrs), which recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns. different tlrs recognize different pathogen-associated molecular patterns, with tlr-4 mediating the response to lipopolysaccharide from gram-negative bacteria. all tlrs have a toll/il-1 receptor (tir) domain, which is responsible for signal transduction. myd88 is one such protein that contains a tir domain. it acts as an adapter, being involved in tlr-2, tlr-4 and tlr-9 signalling; however, our understanding of how tlr-4 signals is incomplete. here we describe a protein, mal (myd88-adapter-like), which joins myd88 as a cytoplasmic tir-domain-containing protein in the human genome. mal activates nf-κb, jun amino-terminal kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 and -2. mal can form homodimers and can also form heterodimers with myd88. activation of nf-κb by mal requires irak-2, but not irak, whereas myd88 requires both iraks. mal associates with irak-2 by means of its tir domain. a dominant negative form of mal inhibits nf-κb, which is activated by tlr-4 or lipopolysaccharide, but it does not inhibit nf-κb activation by il-1ri or il-18r. mal associates with tlr-4. mal is therefore an adapter in tlr-4 signal transduction.
sugar intake is associated with progression from islet autoimmunity to type 1 diabetes: the diabetes autoimmunity study in the young objective a comparison of a parent-completed willett food-frequency questionnaire (ffq) and a self-completed youth/adolescent questionnaire (yaq) has not yet been conducted.   setting in the diabetes autoimmunity study in the young (daisy), parents report their child's diet on the ffq annually from birth until age 10 years, when the child begins to report their own diet using the yaq.   subjects to determine the comparability of these collection methods, 89 children aged 10-17 years and their parents completed the yaq and ffq, respectively, for the child's previous year's diet.   design we compared reported intakes for energy, the macronutrients and a variety of micronutrients of interest to the daisy study.   results bland-altman plots of energy-adjusted differences between questionnaire responses against their means suggested that the two collection methods gave similar results. the average spearman correlation coefficient of all energy-adjusted nutrient intakes was 0.50, and did not differ significantly by gender (males, r=0.48; females, r=0.46) or age (10-11 years, r=0.49; 12-17 years, r=0.51). while correlated, the nutrient values from the ffq were higher than the nutrient values from the yaq.   conclusions while reported nutrient intakes are correlated, an indicator variable defining which survey method a nutrient was collected with should be included in any longitudinal data analyses examining nutrient intakes collected with the yaq and the ffq as independent predictors of a disease outcome.
arachnoid cyst accompanied by proptosis and unilateral high myopia ipsilateral glaucoma developed in a 51-year-old man with a left-sided temporal lobe arachnoidal cyst. ultrasonic examination disclosed a cystic orbital lesion adjacent to the optic nerve. following intracranial decompensation of the arachnoidal cyst, the intraocular pressure dropped markedly. ultrasonography showed a collapse of the presumed optic nerve sheath cyst. while the exact mechanism producing glaucoma in this patient remains unclear, there was an apparent relationship between the elevated intraocular pressure and the arachnoidal cyst.
topological relations between random areal objects within gis this paper presents a model for describing the positional error of line segments in geographical information systems (gis). the model is based on stochastic process theory with the assumptions that the errors of the endpoints of a line segment follow two-dimensional normal distributions. the distribution and density functions of the line segments are derived statistically. the uncertainty information matrix of line segments is derived to indicate the error of an arbitrary point on the line segment. this model covers the cases where two-end points are correlated to each other and points on the line segment are stochastically continuous to each other. the model is a more generic error band model than those previously developed and is called the g-band model.
qualitative approximate behavior composition temporal logic comes in two varieties: linear-time temporal logic assumes implicit universal quantification over all paths that are generated by the execution of a system; branching-time temporal logic allows explicit existential and universal quantification over all paths. we introduce a third, more general variety of temporal logic: alternating-time temporal logic offers selective quantification over those paths that are possible outcomes of games, such as the game in which the system and the environment alternate moves. while linear-time and branching-time logics are natural specification languages for closed systems, alternating-time logics are natural specification languages for open systems. for example, by preceding the temporal operator "eventually" with a selective path quantifier, we can specify that in the game between the system and the environment, the system has a strategy to reach a certain state. the problems of receptiveness, realizability, and controllability can be formulated as model-checking problems for alternating-time formulas. depending on whether or not we admit arbitrary nesting of selective path quantifiers and temporal operators, we obtain the two alternating-time temporal logics atl and atl*.atl and atl* are interpreted over concurrent game structures. every state transition of a concurrent game structure results from a choice of moves, one for each player. the players represent individual components and the environment of an open system. concurrent game structures can capture various forms of synchronous composition for open systems, and if augmented with fairness constraints, also asynchronous composition. over structures without fairness constraints, the model-checking complexity of atl is linear in the size of the game structure and length of the formula, and the symbolic model-checking algorithm for ctl extends with few modifications to atl. over structures with weak-fairness constraints, atl model checking requires the solution of 1-pair rabin games, and can be done in polynomial time. over structures with strong-fairness constraints, atl model checking requires the solution of games with boolean combinations of büchi conditions, and can be done in pspace. in the case of atl*, the model-checking problem is closely related to the synthesis problem for linear-time formulas, and requires doubly exponential time.
analytical study on improving lookup performance of distributed hash table systems under churn we describe a peer-to-peer distributed hash table with provable consistency and performance in a fault-prone environment. our system routes queries and locates nodes using a novel xor-based metric topology that simplifies the algorithm and facilitates our proof. the topology has the property that every message exchanged conveys or reinforces useful contact information. the system exploits this information to send parallel, asynchronous query messages that tolerate node failures without imposing timeout delays on users.
behavioral responses in mice selectively bred for high and low levels of open-field thigmotaxis an overview of ethologically-based animal models suitable for investigating the pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders is presented. the dsm-iiir classification provides a framework for the discussion. the limitations of the models in current use are considered. it is suggested that there is a need for a greater emphasis on animal models of anxiety with an etiological basis.
techniques for shared resource management in systems with throughput processors our analysis shows that many "big-memory" server workloads, such as databases, in-memory caches, and graph analytics, pay a high cost for page-based virtual memory. they consume as much as 10% of execution cycles on tlb misses, even using large pages. on the other hand, we find that these workloads use read-write permission on most pages, are provisioned not to swap, and rarely benefit from the full flexibility of page-based virtual memory.  to remove the tlb miss overhead for big-memory workloads, we propose mapping part of a process's linear virtual address space with a direct segment, while page mapping the rest of the virtual address space. direct segments use minimal hardware---base, limit and offset registers per core---to map contiguous virtual memory regions directly to contiguous physical memory. they eliminate the possibility of tlb misses for key data structures such as database buffer pools and in-memory key-value stores. memory mapped by a direct segment may be converted back to paging when needed.  we prototype direct-segment software support for x86-64 in linux and emulate direct-segment hardware. for our workloads, direct segments eliminate almost all tlb misses and reduce the execution time wasted on tlb misses to less than 0.5%.
contribution of vesicular glutamate transporters to stress response and related psychopathologies: studies in vglut3 knockout mice abstract: gaba and glutamate play a major role in central integration of hypothalamo‐pituitary‐adrenocortical (hpa) stress responses. recent work in our group has focused on mechanisms whereby gabaergic and glutamatergic circuits interact with parvocellular paraventricular nucleus (pvn) neurons controlling the hpa axis. gabaergic neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, preoptic area, and hypothalamus can directly inhibit pvn outflow and thereby reduce acth secretion. in contrast, glutamate activates the hpa axis, presumably by way of hypothalamic and brainstem projections to the pvn. these inhibitory and excitatory pvn‐projecting neurons are controlled by descending information from limbic forebrain structures, including glutamatergic neurons of the ventral subiculum, prefrontal cortex, and gabaergic cells from the amygdala and perhaps septum. lesion studies indicate that the ventral subiculum and prefrontal cortex are involved in inhibition of hpa axis responses to psychogenic stimuli, whereas the amygdala is positioned to enhance hormone secretion by way of gaba‐gaba disinhibitory connections. thus, it seems the psychogenic responses to stress are gated by discrete sets of gabaergic neurons in the basal forebrain and hypothalamus. as such, these neurons are positioned to summate limbic inputs into net inhibitory tone on the pvn and may thus play a major role in hpa dysfunction seen in affective disease states and aging.
prediction and production of simple mathematical equations: evidence from visual world eye-tracking abstract the incremental approach to language production assumes that the production system interleaves planning and articulation processes. two experiments examined this assumption. in the first, participants stated the sums of two two-digit numbers in one of three different kinds of utterances, the sum by itself, the sum followed by the sequence “is the answer,” or the frame “the answer is” followed by the sum. problem difficulty was manipulated as well, so that in some conditions, speakers could (in principle) state the tens component of the sum while planning the ones. latencies to begin to speak were the same for all three utterance types and were affected by the difficulty of the problem as a whole. utterance durations were unaffected by problem difficulty. in the second experiment, participants were induced to speak incrementally through the use of a deadline procedure. both latencies and utterance durations were influenced by the difficulty of the problem. this latter finding supports a basic premise of the incremental approach: speakers sometimes speak and plan simultaneously. nevertheless, the language production system appears not to be architecturally incremental; instead, the extent to which people speak incrementally is under strategic control.
the properties and utility of the core measure of melancholia. background several studies have recognized that depression is a multidimensional construct, although the scales that are currently available have been shown to be limited in terms of the ability to investigate the multidimensionality of depression. the objective of this study is to integrate information from instruments that measure depression from different perspectives–a self-report symptomatic scale, a clinician-rated scale, and a clinician-rated scale of depressive signs–in order to investigate the multiple dimensions underlying the depressive construct. methods a sample of 399 patients from a mood disorders outpatient unit was investigated with the beck depression inventory (bdi), the hamilton depression rating scale (hdrs), and the core assessment of psychomotor change (core). exploratory factor analysis (efa) and confirmatory factor analysis (cfa) were used to investigate underlying dimensions of depression, including item level analysis with factor loadings and item thresholds. results a solution of six depression dimensions has shown good-fit to the data, with no cross-loading items, and good interpretability. item-level analysis revealed that the multidimensional depressive construct might be organized into a continuum of severity in the following ascending order: sexual, cognitive, insomnia, appetite, non-interactiveness/motor retardation, and agitation. conclusion an integration of both signs and symptoms, as well as the perspectives of clinicians and patients, might be a good clinical and research alternative for the investigation of multidimensional issues within the depressive syndrome. as predicted by theoretical models of depression, the melancholic aspects of depression (non-interactiveness/motor retardation and agitation) lie at the severe end of the depressive continuum.
tendon fascicles exhibit a linear correlation between poisson's ratio and force during uniaxial stress relaxation. a transversely isotropic biphasic mixture model was applied to tendon in uniaxial tension. parametric analyses were performed and the sensitivity in predicting material parameters was evaluated. our results provide quantitative evidence for fluid flow as a mechanism that contributes to tendon viscoelasticity. transversely isotropic material properties were calculated for mouse tail tendon fascicles. the average transverse modulus (e(1)) was 0.046 mpa, the fiber-aligned poisson's ratio (v(31)) was 2.73, and the transverse poisson's ratio [(v(21)) was 0.96; these properties were not strain-dependent. the fiber-aligned modulus (e(s)) was strain-dependent and was 20.7 mpa in the toe region and 86.1 mpa in the linear region. these solid matrix properties were consistent with previously published tendon tissue and fascicle data. the fascicle permeability was strain-dependent and was 5.5 x 10(-18)m(4)/ns in the toe region and 0.32 x 10(-18)m(4)/ns in the linear region, similar to previously reported meniscus permeability in tension. the similar permeabilities of both fascicle and tissue-level samples suggest that fluid flow from individual fascicles, not the packing of multiple fascicles together, may be the primary barrier to fluid flow in tendon and thus the primary mechanism for viscoelasticity.
performance of quantiferon-tb gold and tuberculin skin test relative to subjects' risk of exposure to tuberculosis. objectives to compare the sensitivity and the specificity of the quantiferon-tb gold (qft-g) and quantiferon-tb gold in tube (qft-git) diagnostic tests for mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.   methods one-hundred patients with culture and/or pcr confirmed m. tuberculosis infection and 168 volunteers with no risk factors for m. tuberculosis infection were tested to estimate sensitivity and specificity, respectively.   results analysis of data from the tuberculosis (tb) patients with valid results found the sensitivity of qft-git (92.6%, 87/94) to be significantly higher than that for the qft-g test (81.4%, 79/97; p=0.023). the specificity of both qft-git and qft-g was 98.8% (ci: 95.1%-99.8%) with 2 of the 160 low risk subjects with valid results for both tests being positive. data analysis confirmed the manufacturer's recommended test cut-off as being optimal, but identified higher sensitivity could be obtained by using a lower cut-off, with only a moderate decrease in specificity.   conclusions the qft-git test had enhanced sensitivity for detection of m. tuberculosis infection over the qft-g test, whilst maintaining equivalent high specificity. the logistic benefits of the qft-git test format, as well as its higher sensitivity, should enable enhanced tb control.
a new twist on an old idea part 2: cyclosporine preserves normal mitochondrial but not cardiomyocyte function in mini‐swine with compensated heart failure background heart failure in patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function (hfpef) is a prevalent disease characterized by exercise intolerance with poorly understood pathophysiology. we hypothesized that recruitable contractility is impaired in hfpef, accounting for the appearance of symptoms with exertion.   methods and results echocardiographic analysis of myocardial performance was performed at baseline and after a modified dobutamine protocol (max dose 16 μg/kg/min) in participants with known hfpef and age- and gender-matched controls. the primary outcome variable was change in contractile reserve, measured as a change in ejection fraction (ef). recruitable contractility was decreased in hfpef participants compared with control subjects (hfpef 0.4 ± 1.9% vs control 19.0 ± 1.4%; p < .001). during dobutamine infusion, velocities increased in control participants but remained unchanged in the hfpef group, yielding a significant difference between groups (p < .05) for both longitudinal displacement and velocity.   conclusions patients with hfpef have an impaired contractile response to adrenergic stimulation. the blunted response to adrenergic stimulation in the hfpef group suggests that these patients may be unable to respond to periods of increased cardiac demand. this inability to increase contractility appropriately suggests abnormalities of systolic function in this disease and may contribute to exertional intolerance in hfpef.
‘ballroom itself can either make you or break you’ – black gbt youths’ psychosocial development in the house ball community objectives i incorporated qualitative methods to explore how hiv-related stigma functions in new york city's house and ball community (hbc).   methods from january through march 2009, i conducted 20 in-depth 1-on-1 interviews with a diverse sample of new york city hbc members. interviews addressed perceptions of hiv-related stigma, the treatment of hiv-positive members in the community, and the potential impact of hiv-related stigma on risk behaviors.   results hiv-related stigma contributes to a loss of moral experience for hbc members. moral experience (i.e., threats to what really matters in a community) disrupts established social connections and hinders the attainment of "ball status" (i.e., amassing social recognition) in the local world of these individuals.   conclusions my recommendations address hiv-related stigma in the new york city hbc from the vantage of moral experience and highlight the need for longitudinal studies of individual house members and for the implementation of stigma-focused interventions in the community that utilize the unique ball status hierarchy and hbc network to influence social norms surrounding the treatment of hiv-positive community members.
who does not participate in telehealth trials and why? a cross-sectional survey backgroundhome telehealth has the potential to benefit heart failure (hf) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) patients, however large-scale deployment is yet to be achieved.purposethe aim of this review was to assess levels of uptake of home telehealth by patients with hf and copd and the factors that determine whether patients do or do not accept and continue to use telehealth.methodsthis research performs a narrative synthesis of the results from included studies.resultsthirty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria. studies that reported rates of refusal and/or withdrawal found that almost one third of patients who were offered telehealth refused and one fifth of participants who did accept later abandoned telehealth. seven barriers to, and nine facilitators of, home telehealth use were identified.conclusionsresearch reports need to provide more details regarding telehealth refusal and abandonment, in order to understand the reasons why patients decide not to use telehealth.
biomedical factors associated with hospitalization of older adults: the bambuí health and aging study (bhas). background the aims of the study were to describe the pattern of hospital utilization (acute and mental health sectors) of the paisley-renfrew midspan cohort and assess the influence of biological, behavioural and social 'risk factors' (established at the time of screening) on subsequent hospital admissions.   method a cohort analysis was carried out in paisley and renfrew, two post-industrial towns in west central scotland. this used a linked data set covering a 23 year follow-up period to combine original 'risk'-related data with subsequent routine hospital admissions data. the subjects were 8349 women and 7057 men, aged 45-64 in the early to mid-1970s, and representing approximately 80 per cent of the eligible population. the main outcome measures were patterns of hospital utilization (acute and mental health sectors), 'any acute hospital admission', 'a serious acute hospital admission' and 'death' (relative risks of each outcome were calculated for all risk factors).   results the following patterns of hospital utilization were found. only 5 per cent experienced a mental health admission but mean stay was long (265 bed days per cohort member admitted). in contrast, 79 per cent experienced at least one acute hospital stay. the age-specific proportions of cohort members requiring admission increased over time but the growth in acute episodes was even higher (suggesting increasing rates of multiple admission). for non-survivors, 42 per cent of all acute episodes (55 per cent of bed days) took place during the 12 months before death. analysis of risk factors (using cox's proportional hazards model) of 'any admission' and 'a serious admission' showed forced expiratory volume (fev1), age, sex, smoking status, blood pressure, blood sugar, body mass index, cholesterol and deprivation category to be important predictors.   conclusions despite the desirability of alternative settings of care for the chronically ill and dying, a high proportion of hospital bed days were required near the time of death. the absolute size of the demand for hospital services within the cohort was strikingly large and increasing over time. strategies to address the tide of rising admissions will have to confront the increasing proportion of individuals requiring admission as well as the growth in multiple admissions. those who were at higher risk of admission were the older members of the cohort (especially men), those with low fev1, smokers, those who were underweight or obese, the small number with abnormal levels of blood sugar, those with high blood pressure and those who lived in the most deprived areas. thus, programmes which affect these determinants of ill health may be useful in reducing age-specific admission rates.
a genome-wide survey of hd-zip genes in rice and analysis of drought-responsive family members hahb-4 is a member of the helianthusannuus (sunflower) subfamily i of hd-zip proteins that is transcriptionally regulated by water availability and abscisic acid. transgenic arabidopsis thaliana plants overexpressing this transcription factor (tf) exhibit a characteristic phenotype that includes a strong tolerance to water stress. here we show that this tf is a new component of ethylene signalling pathways, and that it induces a marked delay in senescence. plants overexpressing hahb-4 are less sensitive to external ethylene, enter the senescence pathway later and do not show the typical triple response. furthermore, transgenic plants expressing this gene under the control of its own inducible promoter showed an inverse correlation between ethylene sensitivity and hahb-4 levels. potential targets of hahb-4 were identified by comparing the transcriptome of hahb-4-transformed and wild-type plants using microarrays and quantitative rt-pcr. expression of this tf has a major repressive effect on genes related to ethylene synthesis, such as aco and sam, and on genes related to ethylene signalling, such as erf2 and erf5. expression studies in sunflower indicate that hahb-4 transcript levels are elevated in mature/senescent leaves. expression of hahb-4 is induced by ethylene, concomitantly with several genes homologous to the targets identified in the transcriptome analysis (ha-acoa and ha-acob). transient transformation of sunflower leaves demonstrated the action of hahb-4 in the regulation of ethylene-related genes. we propose that hahb-4 is involved in a novel conserved mechanism related to ethylene-mediated senescence that functions to improve desiccation tolerance.
social determinants of under-five mortality in ethiopia: event history analysis using evidence from ethiopian demographic and health survey (edhs) while a number of studies have examined gender preferences for children by studying behavioral measures, such as skewed sex ratios, sex imbalance in infant mortality, and sibling size/order; attitudinal measures have been analyzed less systematically. using 50 demographic and health surveys conducted between 2000 and 2008, this paper seeks to advance our understanding of gender preferences in developing countries by examining attitudinal measures cross-nationally. this study’s findings show that, while balance preference is the most common type of preference in the vast majority of countries, countries/regions vary in the prevalence of son and daughter preferences. a preference for sons is not always found; and, indeed, a preference for daughters is shown to prevail in many societies.
laparoscopic stripping of endometriomas: a randomized trial on different surgical techniques. part i: clinical results. the management of large endometriomas was described in a series of 814 patients. combined therapy using gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (gnrha) and carbon dioxide laser laparoscopy was proposed. drainage and gnrha for 12 weeks provoked a reduction of the endometrioma size up to 50% of the initial value. after vaporization of the internal wall, a cumulative pregnancy of 51% after 1 year was achieved. a recurrence rate of 8% was observed for a follow-up of 2-11 years. histological data demonstrated that the epithelium covering the ovary which is the mesothelium can invaginate in the ovarian cortex. some of the invaginations were seen to be continuous with endometrial tissue, strongly suggesting the metaplasia theory in the pathogenesis of ovarian endometrioma.
a functional vipa-vipb interaction is required for the type vi secretion system activity of vibrio cholerae o1 strain a1552 the bacterium vibrio cholerae, like other human pathogens that reside in environmental reservoirs, survives predation by unicellular eukaryotes. strains of the o1 and o139 serogroups cause cholera, whereas non-o1/non-o139 strains cause human infections through poorly defined mechanisms. using dictyostelium discoideum as a model host, we have identified a virulence mechanism in a non-o1/non-o139 v. cholerae strain that involves extracellular translocation of proteins that lack n-terminal hydrophobic leader sequences. accordingly, we have named these genes “vas” genes for virulence-associated secretion, and we propose that these genes encode a prototypic “type vi” secretion system. we show that vas genes are required for cytotoxicity of v. cholerae cells toward dictyostelium amoebae and mammalian j774 macrophages by a contact-dependent mechanism. a large number of gram-negative bacterial pathogens carry genes homologous to vas genes and potential effector proteins secreted by this pathway (i.e., hemolysin-coregulated protein and vgrg). mutations in vas homologs in other bacterial species have been reported to attenuate virulence in animals and cultured macrophages. thus, the genes encoding the vas-related, type vi secretion system likely play an important conserved function in microbial pathogenesis and represent an additional class of targets for vaccine and antimicrobial drug-based therapies.
applications of shunt facts controller for voltage stability improvment in allusion to the “on-line beforehand decision-making, real time matching”, this paper proposes the stability control flow based on pmu for interconnected power system, which is a real-time stability control. in this scheme, preventive control, emergency control and corrective control are designed to a closed-loop rolling control process, it will protect the stability of power system. then it ameliorates the corrective control process, and presents a new control method which is based on pmu and eeac method. this scheme can ensure the real-time quality and advance the veracity for the corrective control.
mvlfda-based video preference estimation using complementary properties of features in computer vision and multimedia search, it is common to use multiple features from different views to represent an object. for example, to well characterize a natural scene image, it is essential to find a set of visual features to represent its color, texture, and shape information and encode each feature into a vector. therefore, we have a set of vectors in different spaces to represent the image. conventional spectral-embedding algorithms cannot deal with such datum directly, so we have to concatenate these vectors together as a new vector. this concatenation is not physically meaningful because each feature has a specific statistical property. therefore, we develop a new spectral-embedding algorithm, namely, multiview spectral embedding (mse), which can encode different features in different ways, to achieve a physically meaningful embedding. in particular, mse finds a low-dimensional embedding wherein the distribution of each view is sufficiently smooth, and mse explores the complementary property of different views. because there is no closed-form solution for mse, we derive an alternating optimization-based iterative algorithm to obtain the low-dimensional embedding. empirical evaluations based on the applications of image retrieval, video annotation, and document clustering demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
anomalous behaviour detection using spatiotemporal oriented energies, subset inclusion histogram comparison and event-driven processing this paper presents an approach to representing and analyzing spatiotemporal information in support of making qualitative, yet semantically meaningful distinctions at the earliest stages of processing. a small set of primitive classes of spatiotemporal structure are proposed that correspond to categories of stationary, coherently moving, incoherently moving, flickering, scintillating and "too unstructured to support further inference". it is shown how these classes can be represented and distinguished in a uniform fashion in terms of oriented energy signatures. further, empirical results are presented that illustrate the use of the approach in application to natural imagery. the importance of the described work is twofold: (i) from a theoretical point of view a semantically meaningful decomposition of spatiotemporal information is developed. (ii) from a practical point of view, the developed approach has the potential to impact real world image understanding and analysis applications. as examples: the approach could be used to support early focus of attention and cueing mechanisms that guide subsequent activities by an intelligent agent; the approach could provide the representational substrate for indexing video and other spatiotemporal data.
prostate-specific membrane antigen associates with anaphase-promoting complex and induces chromosomal instability we reported previously that the disappearance of cyclin b at the end of mitosis in early drosophila embryos starts at centrosomes and spreads into the spindle [1]. here, we used a novel mutation, centrosome fall off (cfo), to investigate whether centrosomes are required to initiate the disappearance of cyclin b from the spindle. in embryos laid by homozygous cfo mutant mothers, the centrosomes co-ordinately detached from the mitotic spindle during mitosis, and the centrosomeless spindles arrested at anaphase. cyclin b levels decreased on the detached centrosomes, but not on the arrested centrosomeless spindles, presumably explaining why the spindles arrest in anaphase in these embryos. we found that the expression of a non-degradable cyclin b in embryos also caused an anaphase arrest, but most centrosomes remained attached to the arrested spindles, and non-degradable cyclin b levels remained high on both the centrosomes and spindles. these findings suggest that the disappearance of cyclin b from centrosomes and spindles is closely linked to its destruction, and that a connection between centrosomes and spindles is required for the proper destruction of the spindle-associated cyclin b in early drosophila embryos. these results may have important implications for the mechanism of the spindle-assembly checkpoint, as they suggest that unattached kinetochores may arrest cells in mitosis, at least in part, by signalling to centrosomes to block the initiation of cyclin b destruction.
variation in avian vocalizations during the non-breeding season in response to traffic noise this article presents a unifying theory of soundscape ecology, which brings the idea of the soundscape—the collection of sounds that emanate from landscapes—into a research and application focus. our conceptual framework of soundscape ecology is based on the causes and consequences of biological (biophony), geophysical (geophony), and human-produced (anthrophony) sounds. we argue that soundscape ecology shares many parallels with landscape ecology, and it should therefore be considered a branch of this maturing field. we propose a research agenda for soundscape ecology that includes six areas: (1) measurement and analytical challenges, (2) spatial-temporal dynamics, (3) soundscape linkage to environmental covariates, (4) human impacts on the soundscape, (5) soundscape impacts on humans, and (6) soundscape impacts on ecosystems. we present case studies that illustrate different approaches to understanding soundscape dynamics. because soundscapes are our auditory link to nature, we also argue for their protection, using the knowledge of how sounds are produced by the environment and humans.
endoplasmic reticulum stress: relevance and therapeutics in central nervous system diseases previously we reported that amyloid-β (aβ) leads to endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress in cultured cortical neurons and that er-mitochondria ca(2+) transfer is involved in aβ-induced apoptotic neuronal cell death. in cybrid cells which recreate the defect in mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (cox) activity observed in platelets from alzheimer's disease (ad) patients, we have shown that mitochondrial dysfunction affects the er stress response triggered by aβ. here, we further investigated the impact of cox inhibition on aβ-induced er dysfunction using a neuronal model. primary cultures of cortical neurons were challenged with toxic concentrations of aβ upon chemical inhibition of cox with potassium cyanide (kcn). er ca(2+) homeostasis was evaluated under these conditions, together with the levels of er stress markers, namely the chaperone grp78 and xbp-1, a mediator of the er unfolded protein response (upr). we demonstrated that cox inhibition potentiates the aβ-induced depletion of er ca(2+) content. kcn pre-treatment was also shown to enhance the rise of cytosolic ca(2+) levels triggered by aβ and thapsigargin, a widely used er stressor. this effect was reverted in the presence of dantrolene, an inhibitor of er ca(2+) release through ryanodine receptors. similarly, the increase in grp78 and xbp-1 protein levels was shown to be higher in neurons treated with aβ or thapsigargin in the presence of kcn in comparison with levels determined in neurons treated with the neurotoxins alone. although the decrease in cell survival, the activation of caspase-9- and -3-mediated apoptotic cell death observed in aβ- and thapsigargin-treated neurons were also potentiated by kcn, this effect is less pronounced than that observed in ca(2+) signalling and upr. furthermore, in neurons treated with aβ, the potentiating effect of the cox inhibitor in cell survival and death was not prevented by dantrolene. these results show that inhibition of mitochondrial cox activity potentiates aβ-induced er dysfunction and, to a less extent, neuronal cell death. furthermore, data supports that the effect of impaired cox on aβ-induced cell death occurs independently of ca(2+) release through er ryanodine receptors. together, our data demonstrate that mitochondria dysfunction in ad enhances the neuronal susceptibility to toxic insults, namely to aβ-induced er stress, and strongly suggest that the close communication between er and mitochondria can be a valuable future therapeutic target in ad.
individual comparisons of the levels of (e)-3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid, an axillary odor-related compound, in japanese. the axillary microflora of 229 subjects was characterized quantitatively and the results correlated with whether the odor was pungent body odor or instead a faint "acid odor". the axillary flora was found to be a stable mixture of micrococcaceae, aerobic diphtheroids and propionibacteria. significantly higher numbers of bacteria were recovered from the axilla of those with pungent axillary odor than in those with acid odor. aerobic diphtheroids in high numbers were recovered in all subjects having typical body odor. these included lipophilic as well as large-colony diphtheroids. when droplets of apocrine sweat placed on the forearm were inoculated with various bacteria which reside in the axilla, only diphtheroids generated typical body odor. cocci produced a sweaty odor attributable to isovaleric acid.
resident fibroblast lineages mediate pressure overload-induced cardiac fibrosis. understanding the origins and roles of cardiac progenitor cells is important for elucidating the pathogenesis of congenital and acquired heart diseases. moreover, manipulation of cardiac myocyte progenitors has potential for cell-based repair strategies for various myocardial disorders. here we report the identification in mouse of a previously unknown cardiac myocyte lineage that derives from the proepicardial organ. these progenitor cells, which express the t-box transcription factor tbx18, migrate onto the outer cardiac surface to form the epicardium, and then make a substantial contribution to myocytes in the ventricular septum and the atrial and ventricular walls. tbx18-expressing cardiac progenitors also give rise to cardiac fibroblasts and coronary smooth muscle cells. the pluripotency of tbx18 proepicardial cells provides a theoretical framework for applying these progenitors to effect cardiac repair and regeneration.
the effects of accessory stimuli on information processing: evidence from electrophysiology and a diffusion model analysis although sensory perception and neurobiology are traditionally investigated one modality at a time, real world behaviour and perception are driven by the integration of information from multiple sensory sources. mounting evidence suggests that the neural underpinnings of multisensory integration extend into early sensory processing. this article examines the notion that neocortical operations are essentially multisensory. we first review what is known about multisensory processing in higher-order association cortices and then discuss recent anatomical and physiological findings in presumptive unimodal sensory areas. the pervasiveness of multisensory influences on all levels of cortical processing compels us to reconsider thinking about neural processing in unisensory terms. indeed, the multisensory nature of most, possibly all, of the neocortex forces us to abandon the notion that the senses ever operate independently during real-world cognition.
association of the breast cancer antiestrogen resistance protein 1 (bcar1) and bcar3 scaffolding proteins in cell signaling and antiestrogen resistance* the adapter molecule p130cas (cas) plays a role in cellular processes such as proliferation, survival, cell adhesion, and migration. the ability of cas to promote migration has been shown to be dependent upon its carboxyl terminus, which contains a bipartite binding site for the protein tyrosine kinase c-src (src). the association between src and cas enhances src kinase activity, and like cas, src plays an important role in cell proliferation and migration. in this study, we show that src and cas function cooperatively to promote cell migration in a manner that depends upon kinase-active src. another carboxyl-terminal binding partner of cas, and-34/bcar3 (and-34), functions synergistically with cas to enhance src activation and cell migration. the carboxyl-terminal guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain of and-34, as well as the activity of its putative target rap1, contribute to these events. a mechanism through which and-34 may regulate cas-dependent cell migration is suggested by the finding that cas becomes redistributed from focal adhesions to lamellipodia located at the leading edge of and-34 overexpressing cells. these data thus provide insight into how cas and and-34 may function together to stimulate src signaling pathways and promote cell migration.
comparison between overground and dynamometer manual wheelchair propulsion. objective to investigate pushrim forces and joint kinetics during wheelchair propulsion and to discuss the differences between inexperienced and experienced wheelchair users.   design cohort study.   setting human engineering laboratory at a state university.   subjects four men who use manual wheelchairs for mobility and four nondisabled men who did not have extensive experience pushing a wheelchair; all subjects were asymptomatic for upper extremity pain or injury.   methods subjects pushed a commonly used wheelchair fitted with a force-sensing pushrim on a stationary wheelchair dynamometer. video and force data were collected for 5 strokes at one speed of propulsion. pushrim forces and net joint forces and moments were analyzed.   main outcome measures pushrim forces, radial (fr) and tangential (ft), were analyzed and compared for both groups in relation to peak values and time to peak values and as ratios of overall forces generated. net joint forces and moments were analyzed in a similar fashion.   results pushrim forces and joint moments were similar to those previously reported, with radial forces averaging between 34 and 39n and tangential forces ranging on average between 66 and 95n. tangential forces were higher than radial forces, and mean ratios of tangential forces to the resultant force were approximately 75%, whereas mean radial force ratios were approximately 22%. all subjects showed higher joint moments at the shoulder than at the elbow or wrist. a large component of vertical reaction force was seen at the shoulder. significant differences (p < .05) were found between groups for peak tangential force and time to peak tangential and peak vertical forces, with wheelchair users having lower values and longer times to reach the peak values.   conclusions discrete variables from the force-time curves can be used to distinguish between wheelchair users and nonusers. the experienced users tended to push longer, used forces with lower peaks, and took longer time to reach peak values. this propulsive pattern may have been developed to reduce the chance of injury by minimizing the forces at the joints, as a means of maximizing efficiency or as a combination of these factors. more work investigating 3-dimensional forces and the influence of seating position and various conditions of propulsion such as speed changes, ramps, and directional changes on injury mechanisms needs to be completed.
west nile virus ecology in a tropical ecosystem in guatemala. objectives west nile virus (flavivirus: flaviviridae; wnv) has spread rapidly throughout the caribbean basin since its initial detection there in 2001. this report summarizes our current knowledge of wnv transmission in tropical america.   methods we reviewed the published literature and consulted with key public health officials to obtain unpublished data.   results west nile virus infections first appeared in human residents of the cayman islands and the florida keys in 2001, and in apparently healthy jamaican birds sampled early in 2002. serologic evidence of wnv infection in 2002 was detected in horses, chickens and resident free-ranging birds in guadeloupe, the dominican republic, and eastern mexico. in 2003, wnv spread in mexico and northern central america, and serologic evidence was detected in the bahamas, puerto rico and cuba. in 2004, the first serologic evidence of wnv activity in south american ecosystems surfaced in september-october in colombia and trinidad, where domestic animals circulated wnv-neutralizing antibodies.   conclusions the sparse reports of equine, human and avian disease in latin america and the caribbean is puzzling. isolates are needed to evaluate viral attenuation or other possible explanations for reduced disease burden in tropical ecosystems.
switchgrass genomic diversity, ploidy, and evolution: novel insights from a network-based snp discovery protocol backgroundrelatively little information is available for sequence variation in the pig. we previously used a combination of short read (25 base pair) high-throughput sequencing and reduced genomic representation to discover > 60,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (snp) in cattle, but the current lack of complete genome sequence limits this approach in swine. longer-read pyrosequencing-based technologies have the potential to overcome this limitation by providing sufficient flanking sequence information for assay design. swine snp were discovered in the present study using a reduced representation of 450 base pair (bp) porcine genomic fragments (approximately 4% of the swine genome) prepared from a pool of 26 animals relevant to current pork production, and a gs-flx instrument producing 240 bp reads.resultsapproximately 5 million sequence reads were collected and assembled into contigs having an overall observed depth of 7.65-fold coverage. the approximate minor allele frequency was estimated from the number of observations of the alternate alleles. the average coverage at the snps was 12.6-fold. this approach identified 115,572 snps in 47,830 contigs. comparison to partial swine genome draft sequence indicated 49,879 snp (43%) and 22,045 contigs (46%) mapped to a position on a sequenced pig chromosome and the distribution was essentially random. a sample of 176 putative snps was examined and 168 (95.5%) were confirmed to have segregating alleles; the correlation of the observed minor allele frequency (maf) to that predicted from the sequence data was 0.58.conclusionthe process was an efficient means to identify a large number of porcine snp having high validation rate to be used in an ongoing international collaboration to produce a highly parallel genotyping assay for swine. by using a conservative approach, a robust group of snps were detected with greater confidence and relatively high maf that should be suitable for genotyping in a wide variety of commercial populations.
metabolic alterations in the anterior cingulate cortex and related cognitive deficits in late adolescent methamphetamine users adolescence is a period of heightened vulnerability both to addictive behaviors and drug-induced brain damage. yet, only limited information exists on the brain mechanisms underlying these adolescent-specific characteristics. moreover, distinctions in brain correlates between predisposition to drug use and effects of drugs in adolescents are unclear. using cortical thickness and diffusion tensor image analyses, we found greater and more widespread gray and white matter alterations, particularly affecting the frontostriatal system, in adolescent methamphetamine (ma) users compared with adult users. among adolescent-specific gray matter alterations related to ma use, smaller cortical thickness in the orbitofrontal cortex was associated with family history of drug use. our findings highlight that the adolescent brain, which undergoes active myelination and maturation, is more vulnerable to ma-related alterations than the adult brain. furthermore, ma-use-related executive dysfunction was greater in adolescent ma users than in adult users. these findings may provide explanation for the severe behavioral complications and relapses that are common in adolescent-onset drug addiction. additionally, these results may provide insights into distinguishing the neural mechanisms that underlie the predisposition to drug addiction from effects of drugs in adolescents.
arabidopsis thaliana high-affinity phosphate transporters exhibit multiple levels of posttranslational regulation[c][w] functional genomic technologies are generating vast amounts of data describing the presence of transcripts or proteins in plant cells. together with classical genetics, these approaches broaden our understanding of the gene products required for specific responses. looking to the future, the focus of research must shift to the dynamic aspects of biology: molecular mechanisms of function and regulation. phosphorylation is a key regulatory factor in all aspects of plant biology; but it is difficult, if not impossible, for most researchers to identify in vivo phosphorylation sites within their proteins of interest. we have developed a large-scale strategy for the isolation of phosphopeptides and identification by mass spectrometry (nühse et al., 2003b). here, we describe the identification of more than 300 phosphorylation sites from arabidopsis thaliana plasma membrane proteins. these data will be a valuable resource for many fields of plant biology and overcome a major impediment to the elucidation of signal transduction pathways. we present an analysis of the characteristics of phosphorylation sites, their conservation among orthologs and paralogs, and the existence of putative motifs surrounding the sites. these analyses yield general principles for predicting other phosphorylation sites in plants and provide indications of specificity determinants for responsible kinases. in addition, more than 50 sites were mapped on receptor-like kinases and revealed an unexpected complexity of regulation. finally, the data also provide empirical evidence on the topology of transmembrane proteins. this information indicates that prediction programs incorrectly identified the cytosolic portion of the protein in 25% of the transmembrane proteins found in this study. all data are deposited in a new searchable database for plant phosphorylation sites maintained by plantsp (http://plantsp.sdsc.edu) that will be updated as the project expands to encompass additional tissues and organelles.
equilibrium in a two dimensional queueing game: when inspecting the queue is costly the notion ofs-modularity was developed by glasserman and yao [9] in the context of optimal control of queueing networks.s-modularity allows the objective function to be supermodular in some variables and submodular in others. it models both compatible and conflicting incentives, and hence conveniently accommodates a wide variety of applications. in this paper, we introduces-modularity into the context ofn-player noncooperative games. this generalizes the well-known supermodular games of topkis [22], where each player maximizes a supermodular payoff function (or equivalently, minimizes a submodular payoff function). we illustrate the theory through a variety of applications in queueing systems.
phylogeographical patterns shed light on evolutionary process in south america the making of amazonian diversity the biodiversity of the amazon basin is legendary, but the processes by which it has been generated have been debated. in the late 20th century the prevalent view was that the engine of diversity was repeated contraction and expansion of forest refugia during the past 3 million years or so. hoorn et al. (p. 927) analyze findings from a diverse range of disciplines, including molecular phylogeny, ecology, sedimentology, structural geology, and palaeontology, to offer an overview of the entire history of this region during the cenozoic era (66 million years ago). the uplift of the andes was a pivotal event in the evolution of amazonian landscapes because it continually altered river drainage patterns, which in turn put a variety of pressures on organisms to adapt to changing conditions in a multiplicity of ways. hence, the diversity of the modern biota of the amazon has more ancient origins than previously thought. the amazonian rainforest is arguably the most species-rich terrestrial ecosystem in the world, yet the timing of the origin and evolutionary causes of this diversity are a matter of debate. we review the geologic and phylogenetic evidence from amazonia and compare it with uplift records from the andes. this uplift and its effect on regional climate fundamentally changed the amazonian landscape by reconfiguring drainage patterns and creating a vast influx of sediments into the basin. on this “andean” substrate, a region-wide edaphic mosaic developed that became extremely rich in species, particularly in western amazonia. we show that andean uplift was crucial for the evolution of amazonian landscapes and ecosystems, and that current biodiversity patterns are rooted deep in the pre-quaternary.
comparison of antioxidant capability after isopropanol salting-out pretreatment and n-butanol partition extraction, and identification and evaluation of antioxidants of sedum formosanum n.e.br. in our screening program for antioxidants with dpph radical scavenging activity we tested several flavonoids isolated from the leaves of licania licaniaeflora (chrysobalanaceae family) and identified by spectroscopic evidence, particularly with 1h and 13c nmr. all the isolated compounds exhibited dpph radical scavenging activity: quercetin derivatives showed the strongest action, while the flavanone 8-hydroxy-naringenin and kaempferol 3-o-alpha-rhamnoside had the lowest.
the changing epidemiology of ebstein’s anomaly and its relationship with maternal mental health conditions: a european registry-based study the european surveillance of congenital anomalies (eurocat) is a network of population-based congenital anomaly registries in europe, funded by the european union, which has been in operation for more than 30 years. it currently surveys more than 1.7 million births per year, including 31% of births in the european union, and includes almost all population-based european congenital anomaly registries as its members. eurocat member registries collect data, ascertained from multiple sources, on all major structural congenital and chromosomal anomalies. eurocat surveillance relates to three areas: prevalence, primary prevention, and prenatal screening. this article describes the history of eurocat and gives an overview of the current methodology and work of eurocat covering the database content and management, coding and classification of anomalies, core surveillance, prevalence tables, statistical monitoring. the monitoring of new developments in prenatal diagnosis, medication during pregnancy, use of folic acid, and investigation of clusters and exposures are overseen by working groups responsible for organizing research and producing regular reports. the eurocat web site includes current data on prevalence rates and prenatal detection rates-an example of information useful to clinicians, public health service managers, and patients.
feasibility of proton beam therapy for chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the skull base. charged particle beams are ideal for treating skull base and cervical spine tumors: dose can be focused in the target, while achieving significant sparing of the brain, brain stem, cervical cord, and optic nerves and chiasm. for skull base tumors, 10-year local control rates with combined proton-photon therapy are highest for chondrosarcomas, intermediate for male chordomas, and lowest for female chordomas (94%, 65%, and 42%, respectively). for cervical spine tumors, 10-year local control rates are not significantly different for chordomas and chondrosarcomas (54% and 48%, respectively), nor is there any difference in local control between males and females. observed treatment-related morbidity has been judged acceptable, in view of the major morbidity and mortality which accompany uncontrolled tumor growth.
scp160p is required for translational efficiency of codon-optimized mrnas in yeast the yeast spindle pole body (spb), the functional equivalent of mammalian centrosome, duplicates in g1/s phase of the cell cycle and then becomes inserted into the nuclear envelope. here we describe a link between spb duplication and targeted translation control. when insertion of the newly formed spb into the nuclear envelope fails, the sesa network comprising the gyf domain protein smy2, the translation inhibitor eap1, the mrna-binding protein scp160 and the asc1 protein, specifically inhibits initiation of translation of pom34 mrna that encodes an integral membrane protein of the nuclear pore complex, while having no impact on other mrnas. in response to sesa, pom34 mrna accumulates in the cytoplasm and is not targeted to the er for cotranslational translocation of the protein. reduced level of pom34 is sufficient to restore viability of mutants with defects in spb duplication. we suggest that the sesa network provides a mechanism by which cells can regulate the translation of specific mrnas. this regulation is used to coordinate competing events in the nuclear envelope.
referential choices in a collaborative storytelling task: discourse stages and referential complexity matter in this study, children, young adults and elderly adults were tested in production and comprehension tasks assessing referential choice. our aims were (1) to determine whether speakers egocentrically base their referential choice on the preceding linguistic discourse or also take into account the perspective of a hypothetical listener and (2) whether the possible impact of perspective taking on referential choice changes with increasing age, with its associated changes in cognitive capacity. in the production task, participants described picture-based stories featuring two characters of the same gender, making it necessary to use unambiguous forms; in the comprehension task, participants interpreted potentially ambiguous pronouns at the end of similar orally presented stories. young adults (aged 18–35) were highly sensitive to the informational needs of hypothetical conversational partners in their production and comprehension of referring expressions. in contrast, children (aged 4–7) did not take into account possible conversational partners and tended to use pronouns for all given referents, leading to the production of ambiguous pronouns that are unrecoverable for a listener. this was mirrored in the outcome of the comprehension task, where children were insensitive to the shift of discourse topic marked by the speaker. the elderly adults (aged 69–87) behaved differently from both young adults and children. they showed a clear sensitivity to the other person's perspective in both production and comprehension, but appeared to lack the necessary cognitive capacities to keep track of the prominence of discourse referents, producing more potentially ambiguous pronouns than young adults, though fewer than children. in conclusion then, referential choice seems to depend on perspective taking in language, which develops with increasing linguistic experience and cognitive capacity, but also on the ability to keep track of the prominence of discourse referents, which is gradually lost with older age.
tradeoffs between the axial resolution and the signal-to-noise ratio in elastography this paper presents a theoretical framework for performance characterization in strain estimation, which includes the effect of signal decorrelation, quantization errors due to the finite temporal sampling rate, and electronic noise. an upper bound on the performance of the strain estimator in elastography is obtained from a strain filter constructed using these limits. the strain filter is a term used to describe the nonlinear filtering process in the strain domain (due to the ultrasound system and signal processing parameters) that allows the elastographic depiction of a limited range of strains from the compressed tissue. the strain filter predicts the elastogram quality by specifying the elastographic signal-to-noise ratio (snr/sub e/), sensitivity, and the strain dynamic range at a given resolution. the dynamic range is limited by decorrelation errors for large tissue strain values, and electronic noise for low strain values. tradeoffs between different techniques used to enhance elastogram image quality may also be analyzed using the strain filter.
embryoid body formation of human amniotic fluid stem cells depends on mtor the target of rapamycin (tor) is a conserved ser/thr kinase that regulates cell growth and metabolism in response to environmental cues. here, highlighting contributions from studies in model organisms, we review mammalian tor complexes and the signaling branches they mediate. tor is part of two distinct multiprotein complexes, tor complex 1 (torc1), which is sensitive to rapamycin, and torc2, which is not. the physiological consequences of mammalian torc1 dysregulation suggest that inhibitors of mammalian tor may be useful in the treatment of cancer, cardiovascular disease, autoimmunity, and metabolic disorders.
characterization of bacterial communities in sediments receiving various wastewater effluents with high-throughput sequencing analysis the intentional use of biological agents as weapons could result in deaths in numbers comparable to those expected from the use of nuclear weapons. it is one of the most significant terrorism threats ([16][1], [82][2]) and has the potential to catalyze a general breakdown of society through a loss
the synthetic cannabinoid win55212‐2 decreases the intraocular pressure in human glaucoma resistant to conventional therapies we used reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to detect the expression of the central and peripheral cannabinoid receptors (cb1 and cb2, respectively) mrna, and western blotting to show the presence of the cb1 protein in subregions of the human eye. cb2 mrna transcripts were undetectable, while levels of cb1 mrna were significantly expressed in the human retina (25.8 ± 2.46%), ciliary body (210 ± 11.55%) and iris (62.7 ± 5.94%) when compared with those of the normalizing reference gene β2 microglobulin. the cb1 gene encodes a functional protein which is detected in its glycosylated (63 kda) and unglycosylated (54 kda) form in the same areas by a specific purified antibody raised against the amino terminus (residues 1–77) of the cb1 receptor. these results further support the proposed role of the cb1 receptor in controlling intraocular pressure, helping to explain the antiglaucoma properties of marijuana.
arthritis induced by adjuvant in spontaneously hypertensive and normotensive rats: endogenous glucocorticoid effects on inflammatory response evidence is presented that a single injection of bacterial antigen in oil into a footpad of rats of 5 strains induced different clinical forms of adjuvant disease in the individual rat strains. rats were injected with 300 micrograms heat-killed mycobacterium tuberculosis in 50 microliters paraffin. inflammatory lesions and clinical features were recorded on skeletal charts at frequent intervals after injection; methods of charting and quantifying the features are described. by individually marking the rats and using one or more charts per rat we obtained an objective record of the course of disease in each animal and thus a means of distinguishing clinical features from manifestations of disease severity. evaluation of these records showed that there was a pattern of joint involvement and associated physical and clinical features specific to each strain and that such strain specificity was reproducible in groups of rats injected over periods up to 3 1/2 years. these results suggest that the clinical form of adjuvant disease developing in each rat in response to the injection of mycobacteria in oil is genetically determined, and that there are additional factors that interact with genetic ones to allow adjuvant disease to develop in a particular rat.
molecular markers associated with aluminium tolerance in sorghum bicolor aluminum (al) toxicity is the major limiting factor of crop production on acid soils, but some plant species have evolved ways of detoxifying al. here, we report a c2h2-type zinc finger transcription factor art1 (for al resistance transcription factor 1), which specifically regulates the expression of genes related to al tolerance in rice (oryza sativa). art1 is constitutively expressed in the root, and the expression level is not affected by al treatment. art1 is localized in the nucleus of all root cells. a yeast one-hybrid assay showed that art1 has a transcriptional activation potential and interacts with the promoter region of star1, an important factor in rice al tolerance. microarray analysis revealed 31 downstream transcripts regulated by art1, including star1 and 2 and a couple of homologs of al tolerance genes in other plants. some of these genes were implicated in both internal and external detoxification of al at different cellular levels. our findings shed light on comprehensively understanding how plants detoxify aluminum to survive in an acidic environment.
layer-specific interference with cholinergic signaling in the prefrontal cortex by smoking concentrations of nicotine adolescence is a critical period of brain development during which maturation of areas involved in cognitive functioning, such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mpfc), is still ongoing. tobacco smoking during this age can compromise the normal course of prefrontal development and lead to cognitive impairments in later life. recently, we reported that nicotine exposure during adolescence results in a short-term increase and lasting reduction in synaptic mglur2 levels in the rat mpfc, causing attention deficits during adulthood. it is unknown how changed synaptic mglur2 levels after adolescent nicotine exposure affect the ability of mpfc synapses to undergo long-term synaptic plasticity. here, we addressed this question. to model nicotine exposure, adolescent (p34–p43) or adult (p60–p69) rats were treated with nicotine injections three times per day for 10 d. we found that, both during acute activation of nicotinic receptors in the adolescent mpfc as well as immediately following nicotine treatment during adolescence, long-term plasticity in response to timed presynaptic and postsynaptic activity (tltp) was strongly reduced. in contrast, in the mpfc of adult rats 5 weeks after they received nicotine treatment during adolescence, but not during adulthood, tltp was increased. short- and long-term adaptation of mpfc synaptic plasticity after adolescent nicotine exposure could be explained by changed mglur2 signaling. blocking mglur2s augmented tltp, whereas activating mglur2s reduced tltp. our findings suggest neuronal mechanisms by which exposure to nicotine during adolescence alters the rules for spike timing-dependent plasticity in prefrontal networks that may explain the observed deficits in cognitive performance in later life.
cytogenetic analysis of giant oocytes and zygotes to assess their relevance for the development of digynic triploidy. the data using a maximum‐likelihood method was that 66.4 yo of the triploids were the result of dispermy, 23.6 % the result of fertilization of a haploid ovum by a diploid sperm formed by failure of the first meiotic division in the male and 10 % the result of a diploid egg formed by failure of the first maternal meiotic division. the possible sources of error inherent in the technique me reviewed and our results compared with previously published data.
bidirectional associations between parental warmth, callous unemotional behavior, and behavior problems in high-risk preschoolers seven hundred thirty-one income-eligible families in 3 geographical regions who were enrolled in a national food supplement program were screened and randomized to a brief family intervention. at child ages 2 and 3, the intervention group caregivers were offered the family check-up and linked parenting support services. latent growth models on caregiver reports at child ages 2, 3, and 4 revealed decreased behavior problems when compared with the control group. intervention effects occurred predominantly among families reporting high levels of problem behavior at child age 2. families in the intervention condition improved on direct observation measures of caregivers' positive behavior support at child ages 2 and 3; improvements in positive behavior support mediated improvements in children's early problem behavior.
effects of the prospective payment system on anemia management in maintenance dialysis patients: implications for cost and site of care background in 2011, medicare implemented a prospective payment system (pps) covering an expanded bundle of services that excluded blood transfusions. this led to concern about inappropriate substitution of transfusions for other anemia management methods.   study design medicare claims were used to calculate transfusion rates among dialysis patients pre- and post-pps. linear probability regressions adjusted transfusion trends for patient characteristics.   setting & participants dialysis patients for whom medicare was the primary payer between 2008 and 2012.   predictor pre-pps (2008-2010) versus post-pps (2011-2012).   outcomes & measurements monthly and annual probability of receiving one or more blood transfusions.   results monthly rates of one or more transfusions varied from 3.8%-4.8% and tended to be lowest in 2010. annual rates of transfusion events per patient were -10% higher in relative terms post-pps, but the absolute magnitude of the increase was modest (-0.05 events/patient). a larger proportion received 4 or more transfusions (3.3% in 2011 and 2012 vs 2.7%-2.8% in prior years). controlling for patient characteristics, the monthly probability of receiving a transfusion was significantly higher post-pps (β = 0.0034; p < 0.001), representing an -7% relative increase. transfusions were more likely for females and patients with more comorbid conditions and less likely for blacks both pre- and post-pps.   limitations possible underidentification of transfusions in the medicare claims, particularly in the inpatient setting. also, we do not observe which patients might be appropriate candidates for kidney transplantation.   conclusions transfusion rates increased post-pps, but these increases were modest in both absolute and relative terms. the largest increase occurred for patients already receiving several transfusions. although these findings may reduce concerns regarding the impact of medicare's pps on inappropriate transfusions that impair access to kidney transplantation or stress blood bank resources, transfusions should continue to be monitored.
the gene encoding the alternative thymidylate synthase thyx is regulated by sigma factor sigb in corynebacterium glutamicum atcc 13032. a rapid method for the identification of lipids characteristic of the genera corynebacterium, mycobacterium, nocardia, and the "rhodochrous group" has been developed. modifications of previously described methods make this procedure suitable for use in the clinical laboratory. thin-layer chromatography is used to demonstrate the presence of the lipid characteristic of nocardia spp. (type a) in some corynebacteria, nocardias, and members of the "rhodochrous group." precipitation in ether and ethanol is used to demonstrate the presence of mycobacterial mycolic acids. since this procedure can be carried out in less than 2 days and the lipids are extracted from the same batch of cells grown for diaminopimelic acid and whole-cell sugar analyses, it can readily be added to the battery of tests performed in reference laboratories that deal with aerobic actinomycetes and related bacteria.
mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from reed canary grass in paludiculture: effect of groundwater level northern peatland methane (ch4) budgets are important for global ch4 emissions. this study aims to determine the ecosystem ch4 budget and specifically to quantify the importance of phalaris arundinacea by using different chamber techniques in a temperate wetland. annually, roughly 70 ± 35% of ecosystem ch4 emissions were plant-mediated, but data show no evidence of significant diurnal variations related to convective gas flow regardless of season or plant growth stages. therefore, despite a high percentage of arenchyma, p. arundinacea-mediated ch4 transport is interpreted to be predominantly passive. thus, diurnal variations are less important in contrast to wetland vascular plants facilitating convective gas flow. despite of plant-dominant ch4 transport, net ch4 fluxes were low (– 0.005–0.016 μmol m−2 s−1) and annually less than 1% of the annual c-co2 assimilation. this is considered a result of an effective root zone oxygenation resulting in increased ch4 oxidation in the rhizosphere at high water levels. this study shows that although ch4, having a global warming potential 25 times greater than co2, is emitted from this p. arundinacea wetland, less than 9% of the c sequestered counterbalances the ch4 emissions to the atmosphere. it is concluded that p. arundinacea-dominant wetlands are an attractive c-sequestration ecosystem.
targeting cd22 with the monoclonal antibody epratuzumab modulates human b-cell maturation and cytokine production in response to toll-like receptor 7 (tlr7) and b-cell receptor (bcr) signaling introductioncytokines produced by b cells are believed to play important roles in autoimmune diseases. cd22 targeting by epratuzumab has been demonstrated to inhibit phosphorylation of b cell receptor (bcr) downstream signaling in b cells. it has been shown that other sialoadhesin molecules related to cd22 have immunoregulatory functions; therefore, in the present study, we addressed the role of epratuzumab on the production of key cytokines by b cells of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) and of healthy donors (hd).methodsperipheral blood b cells were purified and activated by bcr with or without toll-like receptor 9 (tlr9) stimulation in the presence or absence of epratuzumab. cytokine production by b cells (interleukin [il]-6, tumor necrosis factor [tnf]-α and il-10) in the supernatant and the induction of il-10+ b cells from patients with sle and hd were analyzed.resultsthe secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines tnf-α and il-6 by anti-bcr and bcr- and/or tlr9-activated b cells from hd and patients with sle was inhibited by epratuzumab. in contrast, the production of il-10 by b cells was not affected by epratuzumab under either stimulation condition. consistently, the induction of il-10–producing b cells in culture was not affected by epratuzumab.conclusionsepratuzumab, by targeting cd22, was able to inhibit the production of the proinflammatory cytokines il-6 and tnf-α by b cells, in contrast to il-10, in vitro. these data suggest that targeting cd22 alters the balance between proinflammatory cytokines (tnf-α, il-6) and the regulatory cytokine il-10 as another b cell effector mechanism.
ultra-fast three dimensional imaging of hyperpolarized 13c in vivo a method of obtaining very large nuclear-spin polarizations is proposed and illustrated by density-operator calculations. the prediction is that chemical reaction and rf irradiation can convert the scalar parahydrogen state into polarization of order unity on the nuclear spins of the products of molecular-hydrogen addition reactions. a means of extending the resultant sensitivity enhancement to other spins is proposed in which the transfer of order occurs through population differences not associated with magnetization.
linguistic database summaries using fuzzy logic: towards a human-consistent data mining tool we present the use of fuzzy logic for the derivation of linguistic summaries of data (databases) for providing efficient and human consistent means for the analysis of large amounts of data to be used for a more realistic business decision support. we concentrate on the issue of how to measure the goodness of a linguistic summary, and on how to embed data summarization within the fuzzy querying environment, for an effective and efficient computer implementation. finally, we present an implementation for deriving linguistic summaries of a sales database at a small-to-medium size computer retailer. by analyzing the linguistic summaries obtained we indicate how they can help make decisions by the business owner.
the conversion to metered-dose inhaler with valved holding chamber to administer inhaled albuterol: a pediatric hospital experience. the aim of this study was to compare albuterol delivery in a neonatal ventilated lung model, using three delivery methods: 1) jet nebulizer; 2) chlorofluorocarbon‐pressurized metered dose inhaler (cfc‐mdi) actuated into an ace® spacer; and 3) hydrofluoroalkane‐pressurized mdi (hfa‐mdi) actuated into an ace® spacer. the bench model consisted of a mechanically ventilated infant test lung with ventilator settings to simulate a very low birth weight neonate with moderate lung disease. albuterol solution (0.5%) was nebulized at the humidifier and temperature port, 125 cm and 30 cm from the y‐piece, respectively. albuterol metered dose inhalers (mdis) were actuated into an ace® spacer that was tested in two positions: 1) inline between the endotracheal (et) tube and the y‐piece; and 2) attached to the et tube and administered by manual ventilation. albuterol was collected on a filter at the distal end of the et tube and was quantitatively analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography.
investigation of the roles of exosomes in colorectal cancer liver metastasis. resistance to apoptosis is a recurrent theme in colon cancer. we have shown previously that the 7-transmembrane spanning receptor ox1r for orexins promotes robust apoptosis in the human colon cancer cell line ht29 through an entirely novel mechanism involving phosphorylation of tyrosine-based motifs in ox1r. here, we investigated the status of ox1r in a large series of human colorectal tumors and hepatic metastases. all primary colorectal tumors regardless of their localization and duke's stages and all hepatic metastases tested expressed ox1r mrna and/or protein. in sharp contrast, adjacent normal colonocytes or hepatocytes as well as control normal tissues were negative. next, we showed that nine human colon cancer cell lines established from primary tumors or metastases expressed ox1r mrna and underwent important apoptosis on orexin-a challenge. most interestingly, orexin-a also promoted robust apoptosis in cells that are resistant to the most commonly used drug in colon cancer chemotherapy, 5-fluorouracil. when human colon cancer cells were xenografted in nude mice, orexin-a administered at day 0 strongly slowed the tumor growth and even reversed the development of established tumors when administered 7 days after cell inoculation. orexin-a also acts by promoting tumor apoptosis in vivo because caspase-3 is activated in tumors on orexin treatment of nude mice. these findings support that ox1r is an achilles heel of colon cancers, even after metastasis or chemoresistance. they suggest that ox1r agonists might be novel candidates for colon cancer therapy.
electroencephalographic characteristics of cognitive-specific alerting attention in verbal learning: iii. localized characteristics of eeg spatial synchronization electroencephalograms (eegs) were recorded in 19 standard derivations in 88 subjects (students) in states of: rest with the eyes open; memorization (learning) of verbal bilingual semantic pairs (latin and russian); and recollection (control) of the memorized information. estimates of eeg coherence in these states were compared using statistical methods for the frequency bands θ, α1, α2, β1, β2, and γ. the results of this comparison showed that transition from the state of rest to those of memorization and recollection was accompanied by numerous changes in coherence in all the frequency bands. these changes varied in intensity and embrace practically the entire convexital cerebral cortex. decrease in eeg coherence was predominant during the transition to the memorization state in various frequency bands, whereas during the transition from the rest state to that of recollection, eeg coherence increased in most of the frequency bands except for the band α2. the reproducibility of this pattern of changes in eeg coherence is confirmed by the results in the subgroups formed by randomly subdividing the subjects into two groups. we think that the observed intense rearrangement of the spatial synchronization of the cortex electrical activity reflects the reorganization of the functional systems of neuronal ensembles to provide efficient memorization and recollection, respectively.

early postnatal respiratory viral infection alters hippocampal neurogenesis, cell fate, and neuron morphology in the neonatal piglet the realization, in the past decade or so, that bidirectional communication between the central nervous system and the immune system was likely has sparked an explosion of interest in the roles certain cytokines, particularly the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 beta (il-1 beta), might play in the brain. the observation that il-1 type i receptor was expressed in highest density in the hypothalamus was of significance in identifying a role for il-1 beta in neuroendocrine modulation. however, the finding that receptor expression was also high in the hippocampus, an area of the brain which plays a pivotal role in memory and learning, has led to uncovering a role for il-1 beta in cognitive function. there is now a great deal of evidence suggesting that il-1 beta plays a significant role in hippocampal synaptic function, and the possibility that il-1 beta may trigger some of the detrimental changes in certain neurodegenerative diseases is currently being assessed. the review addresses some of the issues relating to the role of il-1 beta in the brain, specifically in the hippocampus.
clinical and molecular characterization of turkish patients with familial hypomagnesaemia: novel mutations in trpm6 and cldn16 genes. magnesium plays an essential role in many biochemical and physiological processes. homeostasis of magnesium is tightly regulated and depends on the balance between intestinal absorption and renal excretion. during the last decades, various hereditary disorders of magnesium handling have been clinically characterized and genetic studies in affected individuals have led to the identification of some molecular components of cellular magnesium transport. in addition to these hereditary forms of magnesium deficiency, recent studies have revealed a high prevalence of latent hypomagnesemia in the general population. this finding is of special interest in view of the association between hypomagnesemia and common chronic diseases such as diabetes, coronary heart disease, hypertension, and asthma. however, valuable methods for the diagnosis of body and tissue magnesium deficiency are still lacking. this review focuses on clinical and genetic aspects of hereditary disorders of magnesium homeostasis. we will review primary defects of epithelial magnesium transport, disorders associated with defects in ca2+/ mg2+ sensing, as well as diseases characterized by renal salt wasting and hypokalemic alkalosis, with special emphasis on disturbed magnesium homeostasis.
maternal age, parity and isolated birth defects: a population-based case-control study in shenzhen, china among the many physiological factors which have been hypothesized as associated with elevated blood pressure levels and increased incidence of hypertension, the possible effect of pregnancy in the production of these conditions has proven to be among the more elusive to quantitate and evaluate. at the same time, the possible association is among the more interesting from an epidemiological standpoint, not only because of the importance of the primal question of whether or not pregnancy is a factor in the etiology of hypertension, but also because of the component parts represented by those pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia. age is considered by many observers to be an important factor in the production of residual hypertension, and the statistical association of age with increased blood pressure levels is probably the most pronounced and easily demonstrated phenomenon observable in any study population. a moderate decline in average diastolic blood pressure among the general population after age 55 is an exception to this, and is less frequently evaluated. body measurements, race, and several other variables may be cited as also being correlated with blood pressure levels, however, their effect is much less significant than that observable for age.
the canonical e-box motif: a target for glucocorticoid action that drives rhythmic mouse pai-1 transcription in vitro. plasminogen activator inhibitor‐1 (pai‐1) is a key factor of fibrinolytic activity. the activity and mrna abundance show a daily rhythm. to elucidate the mechanism of daily pai‐1 gene expression, the expression of pai‐1 and several clock genes was examined in the heart of homozygous clock mutant (clock/clock) mice. damping of the daily oscillation of pai‐1 gene expression in clock/clock mice was accompanied with damped or attenuated oscillations of mper1, mper2, mbmal1, and mnpas2 mrna. daily restricted feeding induced a daily mrna rhythm of all clock genes and pai‐1 mrna in clock/clock mice as well as wild‐type mice. the peaks of clock genes and pai‐1 mrna were phase‐advanced in the heart of both genotypes after 6 days of restricted feeding. the present results demonstrate that daily pai‐1 gene expression depends on clock gene expression in the heart and that a functional clock gene is not required for restricted feeding‐induced resetting of the peripheral clock.
a novel synthetic smoothened antagonist transiently inhibits pancreatic adenocarcinoma xenografts in a mouse model a smooth(ened) path to drug resistance the hedgehog (hh) signaling pathway has emerged as a key contributor to the growth of medulloblastoma, an aggressive brain tumor. gdc-0449, a drug that ramps down this signaling pathway by binding to the hh pathway component smoothened, was recently shown to induce rapid and dramatic tumor regression in a patient with metastatic medulloblastoma, but the tumor eventually developed resistance to the drug. yauch et al. (p. 572, published online 3 september) show that resistance arose because the tumor acquired a mutation in smoothened that disrupts binding of the drug. identification of this resistance mechanism may facilitate the design of next-generation drugs for this type of cancer. a mutation that prevents binding of a promising drug lead to its target protein confers resistance in a human brain tumor. the hedgehog (hh) signaling pathway is inappropriately activated in certain human cancers, including medulloblastoma, an aggressive brain tumor. gdc-0449, a drug that inhibits hh signaling by targeting the serpentine receptor smoothened (smo), has produced promising anti-tumor responses in early clinical studies of cancers driven by mutations in this pathway. to evaluate the mechanism of resistance in a medulloblastoma patient who had relapsed after an initial response to gdc-0449, we determined the mutational status of hh signaling genes in the tumor after disease progression. we identified an amino acid substitution at a conserved aspartic acid residue of smo that had no effect on hh signaling but disrupted the ability of gdc-0449 to bind smo and suppress this pathway. a mutation altering the same amino acid also arose in a gdc-0449–resistant mouse model of medulloblastoma. these findings show that acquired mutations in a serpentine receptor with features of a g protein–coupled receptor can serve as a mechanism of drug resistance in human cancer.
effects of early-fruit removal on endogenous cytokinins and abscisic acid in relation to leaf senescence in cotton leaf senescence varies greatly among cotton cultivars, possibly due to their root characteristics, particularly the root-sourced cytokinins and abscisic acid (aba). early-senescence (k1) and late-senescence (k2) lines, were reciprocally or self-grafted to examine the effects of rootstock on leaf senescence and endogenous hormones in both leaves and xylem sap. the results indicate that the graft of k1 scion onto k2 rootstock (k1/k2) alleviated leaf senescence with enhanced photosynthetic (pn) rate, increased levels of chlorophyll (chl) and total soluble protein (tsp), concurrently with reduced malondialdehyde (mda) contents in the fourth leaf on the main-stem. the graft of k2 scion onto k1 rootstock enhanced leaf senescence with reduced pn, chl, and tsp, and increased mda, compared with their respective self-grafted control plants (k1/k1 and k2/k2). reciprocally grafted plants differed significantly from their self-grafted control plants in levels of zeatin and its riboside (z+zr), isopentenyl and its adenine (ip+ipa), and aba, but not in those of dihydrozeatin and its riboside (dhz+dhzr) in leaves in late season, which was consistent with variations in leaf senescence between reciprocally and self-grafted plants. the results suggest that leaf senescence is closely associated with reduced accumulation of z+zr, and ip+ipa rather than dhz+dhzr, or enhanced aba in leaves of cotton. genotypic variation in leaf senescence may result from the difference in root characteristics, particularly in z+zr, ip+ipa, and aba which are regulated by the root system directly or indirectly.
drivers of risk perceptions about the invasive non-native plant japanese knotweed in domestic gardens using bioengineering techniques to restore areas invaded by fallopia japonica shows promising results. planting tree cuttings could allow both rapidly re-establishing a competitive native plant community and reducing f. japonica performance. however, f. japonica has been shown to affect native plant species through different mechanisms such as allelopathy. this article investigates the phytotoxic effect of f. japonica on the resprouting capacity and the growth of three salicaceae species with potential value for restoration. an experimental design which physically separates donor pots containing either an individual from f. japonica or bare soil from target pots containing cuttings of populus nigra, salix atrocinerea or salix viminali was used. leachates from donor pots were used to water target pots. the effects of leachates were evaluated by measuring the final biomass of the cuttings. f. japonica leachates inhibited the growth of cuttings, and this effect is linked to the emission of polyphenol compounds by f. japonica. leachates also induced changes in soil nitrogen composition. these results suggest the existence of allelopathic effects, direct and/or indirect, of f. japonica on the growth of salicaceae species cuttings. however, the three species were not equally affected, suggesting that the choice of resistant species could be crucial for restoration success.
psychosocial correlates of depression in children and adolescents with epilepsy in a nigeria neuro-psychiatric hospital patients with epilepsy are at high risk for depression because of an incompletely understood combination of factors that may be both psychosocial and neurological. interictal depression in patients with epilepsy is an undertreated condition, in part because of concern regarding drug interactions and the risk of exacerbating seizures with antidepressant treatment. bipolar disorder is not described as occurring with a higher than expected frequency in the population with epilepsy, but high rates of depression and suicide are well recognised, highlighting the need for more emphasis on antidepressive treatment in this group of at-risk patients.neurological factors, including site and lateralisation of seizure focus, may be important for the development of depression, with left-sided seizure foci having a higher association with depressive symptoms. forced normalisation may be a factor in the paradoxical onset of depression in patients with epilepsy whose seizures suddenly become well controlled by anti-seizure treatment. lowering of folic acid levels by some antiepileptic drugs (aeds) may also influence the expression of depression in patients with epilepsy.new aeds continue to emerge as beneficial treatments themselves for mood disorders, with lamotrigine, gabapentin and, to a lesser extent, topiramate having clinical trials data to support their use in patients with bipolar disease. similar positive data are available for vagal nerve stimulation. mood effects of aeds can be complicated, however, as many of these drugs (e.g. tiagabine) have also been reported to cause depression as an adverse effect. electroconvulsive therapy in depressed patients with epilepsy requires special consideration.the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) and antidepressants that act at multiple receptors (e.g. nefazodone, venlafaxine) are the most appropriate treatments for depressed patients with epilepsy. among these agents, citalopram has a low risk of interactions with aeds. bupropion, clomipramine and maprotiline are associated with a greater risk of seizures compared with other antidepressants and consequently should be used with caution in the treatment of depression in patients with epilepsy.

assessing biodiversity integrity for the conservation of grazed and burnt grassland systems: avian field metabolic rates as a rapid assessment tool in this study, we investigated the responses of two faunal groups, birds and arthropods, to varying degrees of disturbance caused by fire and grazing in south africa, eight study sites of varying fire frequency and stocking density were studied over two summer seasons (october–march). bird assemblages reflected habitat disturbance in a diversity of ways, driven by factors ranging from direct disturbance to changes in habitat structure and functioning, and shifts in food availability. similarly, arthropod diversity and abundance changed seasonally in response to management practices. fire frequency drives faunal assemblage structure and abundance and, in most cases, overrides the effects of grazing at all taxonomic levels. in particular, fire frequency strongly influenced grassland-breeding birds because farms are burnt in the territory-forming stage of the breeding cycle. insectivores and nectarivores were disproportionately impacted by intensive commercial management. of particular concern in this system is the yellow-breasted pipit (anthus chloris), which is regionally and globally vulnerable because of habitat loss. this species is sensitive to any form of habitat disturbance, highlighting the need for conservation attention in these grasslands. of the ten arthropod orders present in the study area, only orthoptera responded positively to burning. however, orthopterans made up on average 78% of arthropod biomass in moist highland grasslands, resulting in high grasshopper biomass on annually burnt farms: this high biomass in turn supports an abundance of insectivores. this reinforces the importance of process-oriented data where a measure of performance, such as reproductive success, is considered in assessing ecosystem condition.
recognizing player goals in open-ended digital games with markov logic networks goal recognition for dialogue systems needs to be fast, make early predictions, and be portable. we present initial work which shows that using statistical, corpus-based methods to build goal recognizers may be a viable way to meet those needs. our goal recognizer is trained on data from apian corpus and then used to determine the agent's most likely goal based on that data. the algorithm is linear in the number of goals, and performs very well in terms of accuracy and early prediction. in addition, it is more easily portable to new domains as does not require a hand-crafted plan library.
switchgrass genomic diversity, ploidy, and evolution: novel insights from a network-based snp discovery protocol backgroundrelatively little information is available for sequence variation in the pig. we previously used a combination of short read (25 base pair) high-throughput sequencing and reduced genomic representation to discover > 60,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (snp) in cattle, but the current lack of complete genome sequence limits this approach in swine. longer-read pyrosequencing-based technologies have the potential to overcome this limitation by providing sufficient flanking sequence information for assay design. swine snp were discovered in the present study using a reduced representation of 450 base pair (bp) porcine genomic fragments (approximately 4% of the swine genome) prepared from a pool of 26 animals relevant to current pork production, and a gs-flx instrument producing 240 bp reads.resultsapproximately 5 million sequence reads were collected and assembled into contigs having an overall observed depth of 7.65-fold coverage. the approximate minor allele frequency was estimated from the number of observations of the alternate alleles. the average coverage at the snps was 12.6-fold. this approach identified 115,572 snps in 47,830 contigs. comparison to partial swine genome draft sequence indicated 49,879 snp (43%) and 22,045 contigs (46%) mapped to a position on a sequenced pig chromosome and the distribution was essentially random. a sample of 176 putative snps was examined and 168 (95.5%) were confirmed to have segregating alleles; the correlation of the observed minor allele frequency (maf) to that predicted from the sequence data was 0.58.conclusionthe process was an efficient means to identify a large number of porcine snp having high validation rate to be used in an ongoing international collaboration to produce a highly parallel genotyping assay for swine. by using a conservative approach, a robust group of snps were detected with greater confidence and relatively high maf that should be suitable for genotyping in a wide variety of commercial populations.
rapid development of adaptive, climate-driven clinal variation in seed mass in the invasive annual forb echium plantagineum l. biological invasions may expose populations to strong selection for local adaptation along geographical gradients in climate. however, evolution during contemporary timescales can be constrained by low standing genetic variation and genetic correlations among life-history traits. we examined limits to local adaptation associated with northern migration of the invasive wetland plant purple loosestrife (lythrum salicaria) using a selection model incorporating a trade-off between flowering time and size at reproduction, and common garden experiments of populations sampled along a latitudinal transect of approximately 1200 km in eastern north america. a strong trade-off between flowering time and size at reproduction caused early-flowering plants to be smaller with reduced seed production in northern populations. northward spread was associated with a decline in genetic variance within populations and an increase in genetic skew for flowering time and size, with limited genetic variation for small, early-flowering genotypes. these patterns were predicted by our selection model of local adaptation to shorter growing seasons and were not consistent with expectations from non-adaptive processes. reduced fecundity may limit population growth and rates of spread in northern populations. identifying genetic constraints on key life-history traits can provide novel insights into invasion dynamics and the causes of range limits in introduced species.
effects of early-fruit removal on endogenous cytokinins and abscisic acid in relation to leaf senescence in cotton leaf senescence varies greatly among cotton cultivars, possibly due to their root characteristics, particularly the root-sourced cytokinins and abscisic acid (aba). early-senescence (k1) and late-senescence (k2) lines, were reciprocally or self-grafted to examine the effects of rootstock on leaf senescence and endogenous hormones in both leaves and xylem sap. the results indicate that the graft of k1 scion onto k2 rootstock (k1/k2) alleviated leaf senescence with enhanced photosynthetic (pn) rate, increased levels of chlorophyll (chl) and total soluble protein (tsp), concurrently with reduced malondialdehyde (mda) contents in the fourth leaf on the main-stem. the graft of k2 scion onto k1 rootstock enhanced leaf senescence with reduced pn, chl, and tsp, and increased mda, compared with their respective self-grafted control plants (k1/k1 and k2/k2). reciprocally grafted plants differed significantly from their self-grafted control plants in levels of zeatin and its riboside (z+zr), isopentenyl and its adenine (ip+ipa), and aba, but not in those of dihydrozeatin and its riboside (dhz+dhzr) in leaves in late season, which was consistent with variations in leaf senescence between reciprocally and self-grafted plants. the results suggest that leaf senescence is closely associated with reduced accumulation of z+zr, and ip+ipa rather than dhz+dhzr, or enhanced aba in leaves of cotton. genotypic variation in leaf senescence may result from the difference in root characteristics, particularly in z+zr, ip+ipa, and aba which are regulated by the root system directly or indirectly.
the role of n-glycosylation in folding, trafficking, and functionality of lysosomal protein cln5 neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (ncls) represent a group of children's inherited neurodegenerative disorders caused by mutations in at least eight different genes. mutations in the cln5 gene result in the finnish variant late infantile ncl characterized by gradual loss of vision, epileptic seizures, and mental deterioration. the cln5 gene encodes a lysosomal glycoprotein of unidentified function. in this study, we have used both transient and stable expression systems for the characterization of cln5, focusing on the localization, processing, and intracellular trafficking. we show that cln5 is proteolytically cleaved, and that the mature polypeptide is transported to the lysosomes. our data provide the first evidence that soluble cln5 protein can also undergo mannose‐6‐phosphate receptor‐independent trafficking to the lysosomes. we studied the localization and maturation of the cln5 carrying the previously uncharacterized vlincl disease causing mutations in hela cells. all analyzed disease mutations disturb the lysosomal trafficking of the mutated cln5 proteins. the level of lysosomal targeting does not correlate, however, to disease onset, indicating that cln5 may also function outside lysosomes. this study furthers our understanding of the basic properties of the cln5 protein, necessary for the characterization of the consequences of disease mutations and for the planning of future therapies for vlincl. hum mutat 31:356–365, 2010. © 2010 wiley‐liss, inc.
effects of the exotic invader musculista senhousia on benthic communities of two mediterranean lagoons synopsis. non-indigenous species (nis) are increasingly conspicuous in marine and estuarine habitats throughout the world, as the number, variety, and effects of these species continue to accrue. most of these nis invasions result from anthropogenic dispersal. although the relative importance of different dispersal mechanisms varies both spatially and temporally, the global movement of ballast water by ships appears to be the largest single vector for nis transfer today, and many recent invasions have resulted from this transfer. the rate of new invasions may have increased in recent decades, perhaps due to changes in ballast water transport. estuaries have been especially common sites of invasions, accumulating from tens to hundreds of nis per estuary that include most major taxonomic and trophic groups. we now know of approximately 400 nis along the pacific, atlantic and gulf coasts of the u.s., and hundreds of marine and estuarine nis are reported from other regions of the world. although available information about invasions is limited to a few regions and underestimates the actual number of nis invasions, there are apparent differences in the frequency of nis among sites. mechanisms responsible for observed patterns among sites likely include variation in supply of nis, and perhaps variation in properties of recipient or donor communities, but the role of these mechanisms has not been tested. although our present knowledge about the extent, patterns and mechanisms of marine invasions is still in its infancy, it is clear that nis are a significant force of change in marine and especially estuarine communities globally. taxonomically diverse nis are having significant effects on many, if not most, estuaries that fundamentally alter population, community, and ecosystems processes. the impacts of most nis remain unknown, and the predictability of their direct and indirect effects remains uncertain. nonetheless, based upon the documented extent of nis invasions and scope of then* effects, studies of marine communities that do not include nis are increasingly incomplete.
ethanol-lock technique for persistent bacteremia of long-term intravascular devices in pediatric patients. bacteria that adhere to implanted medical devices or damaged tissue can encase themselves in a hydrated matrix of polysaccharide and protein, and form a slimy layer known as a biofilm. antibiotic resistance of bacteria in the biofilm mode of growth contributes to the chronicity of infections such as those associated with implanted medical devices. the mechanisms of resistance in biofilms are different from the now familiar plasmids, transposons, and mutations that confer innate resistance to individual bacterial cells. in biofilms, resistance seems to depend on multicellular strategies. we summarise the features of biofilm infections, review emerging mechanisms of resistance, and discuss potential therapies.
the combination of mln2238 (ixazomib) with interferon-alpha results in enhanced cell death in melanoma purpose: the success of bortezomib therapy for treatment of multiple myeloma (mm) led to the development of structurally and pharmacologically distinct novel proteasome inhibitors. in the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of one such novel orally bioactive proteasome inhibitor mln9708/mln2238 in mm using well-established in vitro and in vivo models. experimental design: mm cell lines, primary patient cells, and the human mm xenograft animal model were used to study the antitumor activity of mn2238. results: treatment of mm cells with mln2238 predominantly inhibits chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome and induces accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. mln2238 inhibits growth and induces apoptosis in mm cells resistant to conventional and bortezomib therapies without affecting the viability of normal cells. in animal tumor model studies, mln2238 is well tolerated and inhibits tumor growth with significantly reduced tumor recurrence. a head-to-head analysis of mln2238 versus bortezomib showed a significantly longer survival time in mice treated with mln2238 than mice receiving bortezomib. immununostaining of mm tumors from mln2238-treated mice showed growth inhibition, apoptosis, and a decrease in associated angiogenesis. mechanistic studies showed that mln2238-triggered apoptosis is associated with activation of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9; increase in p53, p21, noxa, puma, and e2f; induction of endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress response proteins bip, phospho-eif2-α, and chop; and inhibition of nuclear factor kappa b. finally, combining mln2238 with lenalidomide, histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, or dexamethasone triggers synergistic anti-mm activity. conclusion: our preclinical study supports clinical evaluation of mln9708, alone or in combination, as a potential mm therapy. clin cancer res; 17(16); 5311–21. ©2011 aacr.
provenance-based reproducibility in the semantic web through technologies such as rss (really simple syndication), web services, and ajax (asynchronous javascript and xml), the internet has facilitated the emergence of applications that are composed from a variety of services and data sources. through tools such as yahoo pipes, these “mash-ups” can be composed in a dynamic, just-in-time manner from components provided by multiple institutions (i.e., google, amazon, your neighbor). however, when using these applications, it is not apparent where data comes from or how it is processed. thus, to inspire trust and confidence in mash-ups, it is critical to be able to analyze their processes after the fact. these trailing analyses, in particular the determination of the provenance of a result (i.e., the process that led to it), are enabled by process documentation, which is documentation of an application's past process created by the components of that application at execution time. in this article, we define a generic conceptual data model that supports the autonomous creation of attributable, factual process documentation for dynamic multi-institutional applications. the data model is instantiated using two internet formats, owl and xml, and is evaluated with respect to questions about the provenance of results generated by a complex bioinformatics mash-up.
region-based correspondence between 3d shapes via spatially smooth biclustering the problem of mapping between two non‐isometric surfaces admits ambiguities on both local and global scales. for instance, symmetries can make it possible for multiple maps to be equally acceptable, and stretching, slippage, and compression introduce difficulties deciding exactly where each point should go. since most algorithms for point‐to‐point or even sparse mapping struggle to resolve these ambiguities, in this paper we introduce soft maps, a probabilistic relaxation of point‐to‐point correspondence that explicitly incorporates ambiguities in the mapping process. in addition to explaining a continuous theory of soft maps, we show how they can be represented using probability matrices and computed for given pairs of surfaces through a convex optimization explicitly trading off between continuity, conformity to geometric descriptors, and spread. given that our correspondences are encoded in matrix form, we also illustrate how low‐rank approximation and other linear algebraic tools can be used to analyze, simplify, and represent both individual and collections of soft maps.
the broad neutralizing antibody responses after hiv-1 superinfection are not dominated by antibodies directed to epitopes common in single infection background the isolation of human monoclonal antibodies (mabs) that neutralize a broad spectrum of primary hiv-1 isolates and the characterization of the human neutralizing antibody b cell response to hiv-1 infection are important goals that are central to the design of an effective antibody-based vaccine. methods and findings we immortalized igg+ memory b cells from individuals infected with diverse clades of hiv-1 and selected on the basis of plasma neutralization profiles that were cross-clade and relatively potent. culture supernatants were screened using various recombinant forms of the envelope glycoproteins (env) in multiple parallel assays. we isolated 58 mabs that were mapped to different env surfaces, most of which showed neutralizing activity. one mab in particular (hj16) specific for a novel epitope proximal to the cd4 binding site on gp120 selectively neutralized a multi-clade panel of tier-2 hiv-1 pseudoviruses, and demonstrated reactivity that was comparable in breadth, but distinct in neutralization specificity, to that of the other cd4 binding site-specific neutralizing mab b12. a second mab (hgn194) bound a conserved epitope in the v3 crown and neutralized all tier-1 and a proportion of tier-2 pseudoviruses tested, irrespective of clade. a third mab (hk20) with broad neutralizing activity, particularly as a fab fragment, recognized a highly conserved epitope in the hr-1 region of gp41, but showed striking assay-dependent selectivity in its activity. conclusions this study reveals that by using appropriate screening methods, a large proportion of memory b cells can be isolated that produce mabs with hiv-1 neutralizing activity. three of these mabs show unusual breadth of neutralization and therefore add to the current panel of hiv-1 neutralizing antibodies with potential for passive protection and template-based vaccine design.
orexins/hypocretins control bistability of hippocampal long‐term synaptic plasticity through co‐activation of multiple kinases synaptic trafficking of ampa-rs, controlled by small gtpase ras signaling, plays a key role in synaptic plasticity. however, how ras signals synaptic ampa-r trafficking is unknown. here we show that low levels of ras activity stimulate extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (mek)-p42/44 mapk (extracellular signal-regulated kinase [erk]) signaling, whereas high levels of ras activity stimulate additional pi3 kinase (pi3k)-protein kinase b (pkb) signaling, each accounting for approximately 50% of the potentiation during long-term potentiation (ltp). spontaneous neural activity stimulates the ras-mek-erk pathway that drives glur2l into synapses. in the presence of neuromodulator agonists, neural activity also stimulates the ras-pi3k-pkb pathway that drives glur1 into synapses. neuromodulator release increases with increases of vigilance. correspondingly, ras-mek-erk activity in sleeping animals is sufficient to deliver glur2l into synapses, while additional increased ras-pi3k-pkb activity in awake animals delivers glur1 into synapses. thus, state-dependent ras signaling, which specifies downstream mek-erk and pi3k-pkb pathways, differentially control glur2l- and glur1-dependent synaptic plasticity.
quantitative and functional interrogation of parent-of-origin allelic expression biases in the brain we present a novel pipeline and methodology for simultaneously estimating isoform expression and allelic imbalance in diploid organisms using rna-seq data. we achieve this by modeling the expression of haplotype-specific isoforms. if unknown, the two parental isoform sequences can be individually reconstructed. a new statistical method, mmseq, deconvolves the mapping of reads to multiple transcripts (isoforms or haplotype-specific isoforms). our software can take into account non-uniform read generation and works with paired-end reads.
incremental local gaussian regression novel applications in unstructured and non-stationary human environments require robots that learn from experience and adapt autonomously to changing conditions. predictive models therefore not only need to be accurate, but should also be updated incrementally in real-time and require minimal human intervention. incremental sparse spectrum gaussian process regression is an algorithm that is targeted specifically for use in this context. rather than developing a novel algorithm from the ground up, the method is based on the thoroughly studied gaussian process regression algorithm, therefore ensuring a solid theoretical foundation. non-linearity and a bounded update complexity are achieved simultaneously by means of a finite dimensional random feature mapping that approximates a kernel function. as a result, the computational cost for each update remains constant over time. finally, algorithmic simplicity and support for automated hyperparameter optimization ensures convenience when employed in practice. empirical validation on a number of synthetic and real-life learning problems confirms that the performance of incremental sparse spectrum gaussian process regression is superior with respect to the popular locally weighted projection regression, while computational requirements are found to be significantly lower. the method is therefore particularly suited for learning with real-time constraints or when computational resources are limited.
melatonin modulates neuronal cell death induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress under insulin resistance condition most protein phosphatases have little intrinsic substrate specificity, making selective pharmacological inhibition of specific dephosphorylation reactions a challenging problem. in a screen for small molecules that protect cells from endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress, we identified salubrinal, a selective inhibitor of cellular complexes that dephosphorylate eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit alpha (eif2alpha). salubrinal also blocks eif2alpha dephosphorylation mediated by a herpes simplex virus protein and inhibits viral replication. these results suggest that selective chemical inhibitors of eif2alpha dephosphorylation may be useful in diseases involving er stress or viral infection. more broadly, salubrinal demonstrates the feasibility of selective pharmacological targeting of cellular dephosphorylation events.
monocular core zones and binocular border strips in primate striate cortex revealed by the contrasting effects of enucleation, eyelid suture, and retinal laser lesions on cytochrome oxidase activity monkey models were used to examine the effects of competition for cortical territory between two eyes which were deprived simultaneously, but each eye experienced a different type of deprivation. we wanted to determine whether, under this condition of binocular unequal deprivation, the postnatal process of segregation into ocular dominance columns proceeds according to the same rules as those that apply to competition between a deprived and an undeprived fellow eye. our models involved surgical removal of the natural lens from one eye in newborn rhesus monkeys. the resulting aphakia was corrected optically to a near point with extended‐wear contact lenses. the fellow eyes were either left unmanipulated or occluded with opaque contact lenses for varying periods during the day. at the end of the rearing period, some monkeys from each experimental group had either one eye enucleated or sustained injury to the retinal ganglion cells of one eye. the histochemical reaction for cytochrome oxidase was used to reveal the widths of ocular dominance columns in layer 4c of striate cortex in these monkeys. under all experimental conditions, the axons related to the two eyes occupied segregated fields. the amount of cortical territory related to the aphakic, optically corrected eye depended on the manipulations of the fellow eye. in competition with an unmanipulated fellow eye, the aphakic eye's territory was greatly reduced. in competition with a part‐time occluded eye, its territory was reduced to a lesser degree, depending on the duration of the occlusion. in competition with a continuously occluded eye, however, the space related to the aphakic, optically corrected eye was slightly greater than that related to the occluded eye. since neither the aphakic nor the continuously occluded eye receives normal visual input, they are both impaired. therefore, they may compete on an almost equal basis for synaptic territory in layer 4c of striate cortex. moreover, it is likely that activities originating in the aphakic and the continuously occluded eye are asynchronous, and that this condition is sufficient to drive the postnatal segregation of inputs from the two deprived eyes.
preparation and characterization of chitin benzoic acid esters trifluoroacetic anhydride is an effective promoter for the preparation of chitin single- and mixed-acid esters. complete dissolution is achieved within 30 min when powdered chitin is heated at 70 degrees c in a mixed solution of carboxylic acid(s) and trifluoroacetic anhydride. chitin esters prepared are chitin acetate, chitin butyrate, chitin hexanoate and chitin octanoate, chitin co-acetate/butyrate, chitin co-acetate/hexanoate, chitin co-acetate/octanoate, chitin co-acetate/palmitate, each from a solution of the respective reactants. the products have degrees of o-acyl substitution in a range of ds 1-2 depending on the nature of acyl group, as analyzed by gas-liquid and high-pressure liquid chromatography. acetic acid as a mutual component for the mixed-acid esters increases the total degree of substitution, and the acetyl substitution is close to the relative distribution in the reaction mixture for chitin co-acetate/butyrate. it is favored over hexanoate, octanoate, and palmitate. the parent molecules, as calculated by the composition of the chitin esters and their molecular weights by light-scattering spectroscopy, are 30 kda for the smallest and 150-151 kda for the largest. films of these chitin derivatives when cast from solution are strong and flexible with limited extensibility. by dynamic mechanical analysis of the ester film, it was found that both the glass transition temperature (t(g)) and the tensile modulus (e' at 25 degrees c) are highest for chitin acetate (218 degrees c and 5.8 gpa), and lowest for chitin octanoate (182 degrees c and 1.5 gpa). for the other esters, these values lie between the above-cited values, where the t(g) and the e' decrease with an increase in the chain length of the acyl constituent.
an object-centred reference frame for control of grasping: effects of grasping a distractor object on visuomotor control the main aim of the present study was to clarify whether different types of grasping may affect the transport component of prehension movements. to this purpose two experiments were carried out. in the first experiment the kinematics of arm movements (transport and manipulation components) were studied in eight normal subjects instructed to reach and grasp different objects located either 20 or 30 cm from their hand. the objects employed required two different types of grip: prehension with the whole hand and prehension with the index finger and the thumb (precision grip). in the second experiment subjects were instructed to point to the same objects employed in the first experiment. this experiment served as a control for the precision requirements related to the object size. the results showed that, once the precision requirements were taken into account, the transport component remained unmodified with the different types of grip. the time course of the manipulation component and its temporal relations with the transport component changed with the type of grasping. the maximal hand aperture was reached earlier in the precision grip than in the whole hand prehension and the temporal coupling with the transport component was weaker in the former condition than in the latter. the data are interpreted as further evidence in favour of independence between the transport and the manipulation "channels".
neuronal network analysis axons in the cerebral cortex receive synaptic input at the axon initial segment almost exclusively from γ-aminobutyric acid–releasing (gabaergic) axo-axonic cells (aacs). the axon has the lowest threshold for action potential generation in neurons; thus, aacs are considered to be strategically placed inhibitory neurons controlling neuronal output. however, we found that aacs can depolarize pyramidal cells and can initiate stereotyped series of synaptic events in rat and human cortical networks because of a depolarized reversal potential for axonal relative to perisomatic gabaergic inputs. excitation and signal propagation initiated by aacs is supported by the absence of the potassium chloride cotransporter 2 in the axon.
analysis of in vitro binding of dietary fibers by the phytoestrogen, daidzein, in the presence and absence of iron equol, a nonsteroidal estrogen of dietary origin, was recently identified in human urine, and is excreted in amounts comparable to the classical steroidal estrogens. we confirm here that phytoestrogens which are abundant in dietary soya protein are converted by human gastrointestinal flora to this weak estrogen. after the ingestion of meals containing cooked soya protein the urinary excretion of equol in four of six subjects studied increased by up to 1000-fold and this compound was the major phenolic compound found in the urine. these data also indicate that some subjects are unable to either produce or excrete equol despite the challenge of a diet containing soya. in view of the increasing use of commercial soya products in the diet and the capacity of human bacterial flora to synthesize this weak estrogen from the abundance of phytoestrogens in soya, the potential relevance of these observations to the diseases implicating steroid hormones is discussed.
a prospective open‐label trial of lamotrigine monotherapy in children and adolescents with bipolar disorder background: preliminary data from case reports and small open trials suggest a role for lamotrigine in the treatment of bipolar disorder, although controlled data for the manic phase are lacking. method: thirty inpatients with a dsm-iv diagnosis of bipolar i disorder, currently manic, were randomly allocated to receive either lamotrigine (25 mg once daily for 1 week, 50 mg once daily for the second week, and 100 mg once daily for the last 2 weeks) or lithium (400 mg twice daily) in a 4-week randomized, double-blind, clinical trial. results: both treatments improved symptoms of mania, as assessed by the mania rating scale, brief psychiatric rating scale, clinical global impression severity and improvement scales, and the global assessment of functioning scale. there were no significant differences between groups at any time point, suggesting that the dose escalation required for lamotrigine did not adversely affect its onset of action. secondary outcome measures, including the use of lorazepam as rescue medication, did not differ between the groups. no significant adverse events were noted in either group. conclusion: in this pilot study, lamotrigine was as effective as lithium in the treatment of patients with bipolar disorder hospitalised for acute mania.
release of ethylbenzene and styrene from plastic cheese containers packaging has become an indispensible element in the food manufacturing process, and different types of additives, such as antioxidants, stabilizers, lubricants, anti-static and anti-blocking agents, have also been developed to improve the performance of polymeric packaging materials. recently the packaging has been found to represent a source of contamination itself through the migration of substances from the packaging into food. various analytical methods have been developed to analyze the migrants in the foodstuff, and migration evaluation procedures based on theoretical prediction of migration from plastic food contact material were also introduced recently. in this paper, the regulatory control, analytical methodology, factors affecting the migration and migration evaluation are reviewed.
optimal survival time-related cut-point with censored data. in biomedical research and practice, quantitative tests or biomarkers are often used for diagnostic or screening purposes, with a cut point established on the quantitative measurement to aid binary classification. this paper introduces an alternative to the traditional methods based on the youden index and the closest-to-(0, 1) criterion for threshold selection. a concordance probability evaluating the classification accuracy of a dichotomized measure is defined as an objective function of the possible cut point. a nonparametric approach is used to search for the optimal cut point maximizing the objective function. the procedure is shown to perform well in a simulation study. using data from a real-world study of arsenic-induced skin lesions, we apply the method to a measure of blood arsenic levels, selecting a cut point to be used as a warning threshold.
morphometric assessment of corpus callosum and cerebral hemispheres with magnetic resonance imaging we measured the mri area of corpus callosum in 104 normal adults, 51 men, 53 women, 52 right- and 52 left-handers. there were no significant sex or handedness differences. callosal areas did not correlate with brain size nor with measures of lateralization for hand performance, dichotic listening, or visual field preference. the results are contrary to the notion of increased callosal connectivity in left-handers, women, or individuals with less-lateralized function.
global stability analysis of competitive neural networks with mixed time-varying delays and discontinuous neuron activations this paper introduces a general class of neural networks with arbitrary constant delays in the neuron interconnections, and neuron activations belonging to the set of discontinuous monotone increasing and (possibly) unbounded functions. the discontinuities in the activations are an ideal model of the situation where the gain of the neuron amplifiers is very high and tends to infinity, while the delay accounts for the finite switching speed of the neuron amplifiers, or the finite signal propagation speed. it is known that the delay in combination with high-gain nonlinearities is a particularly harmful source of potential instability. the goal of this paper is to single out a subclass of the considered discontinuous neural networks for which stability is instead insensitive to the presence of a delay. more precisely, conditions are given under which there is a unique equilibrium point of the neural network, which is globally exponentially stable for the states, with a known convergence rate. the conditions are easily testable and independent of the delay. moreover, global convergence in finite time of the state and output is investigated. in doing so, new interesting dynamical phenomena are highlighted with respect to the case without delay, which make the study of convergence in finite time significantly more difficult. the obtained results extend previous work on global stability of delayed neural networks with lipschitz continuous neuron activations, and neural networks with discontinuous neuron activations but without delays.
evolution of the leucine gene cluster in buchnera aphidicola: insights from chromosomal versions of the cluster. the comparative analysis of three strains of the endosymbiotic bacterium buchnera aphidicola has revealed high genome stability associated with an almost complete absence of chromosomal rearrangements and horizontal gene transfer events during the past 150 million years. the loss of genes involved in dna uptake and recombination in the initial stages of endosymbiosis probably underlies this stability. gene loss, which was extensive during the initial steps of buchnera evolution, has continued in the different buchnera lineages since their divergence.
the canonical e-box motif: a target for glucocorticoid action that drives rhythmic mouse pai-1 transcription in vitro. plasminogen activator inhibitor‐1 (pai‐1) is a key factor of fibrinolytic activity. the activity and mrna abundance show a daily rhythm. to elucidate the mechanism of daily pai‐1 gene expression, the expression of pai‐1 and several clock genes was examined in the heart of homozygous clock mutant (clock/clock) mice. damping of the daily oscillation of pai‐1 gene expression in clock/clock mice was accompanied with damped or attenuated oscillations of mper1, mper2, mbmal1, and mnpas2 mrna. daily restricted feeding induced a daily mrna rhythm of all clock genes and pai‐1 mrna in clock/clock mice as well as wild‐type mice. the peaks of clock genes and pai‐1 mrna were phase‐advanced in the heart of both genotypes after 6 days of restricted feeding. the present results demonstrate that daily pai‐1 gene expression depends on clock gene expression in the heart and that a functional clock gene is not required for restricted feeding‐induced resetting of the peripheral clock.
personalized nutrition and obesity background— previous studies on gene-lifestyle interaction and obesity have focused mostly on the fto gene and physical activity, whereas little attention has been paid to sedentary behavior as indicated by television (tv) watching. methods and results— we analyzed interactions between tv watching, leisure time physical activity, and genetic predisposition in relation to body mass index (bmi) in 7740 women and 4564 men from 2 prospective cohorts: the nurses' health study and the health professionals follow-up study. data on physical activity and tv watching were collected 2 years before assessment of bmi. a weighted genetic risk score was calculated on the basis of 32 established bmi-associated variants. in both women and men, the genetic associations with bmi strengthened with increased hours of tv watching. an increment of 10 points in the weighted genetic risk score was associated with 0.8 (se, 0.4), 0.8 (se, 0.2), 1.4 (se, 0.2), 1.5 (se, 0.2), and 3.4 (se, 1.0) kg/m2 higher bmi across the 5 categories of tv watching (0–1, 2–5, 6–20, 21–40, and >40 h/wk; p for interaction=0.001). in contrast, the genetic association with bmi weakened with increased levels of physical activity. an increment of 10 points in the weighted genetic risk score was associated with 1.5 (se, 0.2), 1.3 (se, 0.2), 1.2 (se, 0.2), 1.2 (se, 0.2), and 0.8 (se, 0.2) kg/m2 higher bmi across the quintiles of physical activity. the interactions of tv watching and physical activity with genetic predisposition in relation to bmi were independent of each other. conclusions— a sedentary lifestyle, indicated by prolonged tv watching, may accentuate the predisposition to elevated adiposity, whereas greater leisure time physical activity may attenuate the genetic association.
interval pattern concept lattice as a classifier ensemble personal credit scoring is the application of financial risk forecasting. it becomes an even important task as financial institutions have been experiencing serious competition and challenges. in this paper, the techniques used for credit scoring are summarized and classified and the new method—ensemble learning model is introduced. this article also discusses some problems in current study. it points out that changing the focus from static credit scoring to dynamic behavioral scoring and maximizing revenue by decreasing the type i and type ii error are two issues in current study. it also suggested that more complex models cannot always been applied to actual situation. therefore, how to use the assessment models widely and improve the prediction accuracy is the main task for future research.
referential choices in a collaborative storytelling task: discourse stages and referential complexity matter in this study, children, young adults and elderly adults were tested in production and comprehension tasks assessing referential choice. our aims were (1) to determine whether speakers egocentrically base their referential choice on the preceding linguistic discourse or also take into account the perspective of a hypothetical listener and (2) whether the possible impact of perspective taking on referential choice changes with increasing age, with its associated changes in cognitive capacity. in the production task, participants described picture-based stories featuring two characters of the same gender, making it necessary to use unambiguous forms; in the comprehension task, participants interpreted potentially ambiguous pronouns at the end of similar orally presented stories. young adults (aged 18–35) were highly sensitive to the informational needs of hypothetical conversational partners in their production and comprehension of referring expressions. in contrast, children (aged 4–7) did not take into account possible conversational partners and tended to use pronouns for all given referents, leading to the production of ambiguous pronouns that are unrecoverable for a listener. this was mirrored in the outcome of the comprehension task, where children were insensitive to the shift of discourse topic marked by the speaker. the elderly adults (aged 69–87) behaved differently from both young adults and children. they showed a clear sensitivity to the other person's perspective in both production and comprehension, but appeared to lack the necessary cognitive capacities to keep track of the prominence of discourse referents, producing more potentially ambiguous pronouns than young adults, though fewer than children. in conclusion then, referential choice seems to depend on perspective taking in language, which develops with increasing linguistic experience and cognitive capacity, but also on the ability to keep track of the prominence of discourse referents, which is gradually lost with older age.
inequalities in health care utilization for common childhood illnesses in ethiopia: evidence from the 2011 ethiopian demographic and health survey the effects of socioeconomic status (ses) on health are well documented in adulthood, but far less is known about its effects in childhood. the authors reviewed the literature and found support for a childhood ses effect, whereby each decrease in ses was associated with an increased health risk. the authors explored how this relationship changed as children underwent normal developmental changes and proposed 3 models to describe the temporal patterns. the authors found that a model's capacity to explain ses-health relationships varied across health outcomes. childhood injury showed stronger relationships with ses at younger ages, whereas smoking showed stronger relationships with ses in adolescence. finally, the authors proposed a developmental approach to exploring mechanisms that link ses and child health.
does semi-rigid instrumentation using both flexion and extension dampening spacers truly provide an intermediate level of stabilization? study design. a literature-based review. objectives. to review management and controversies and to present authors recommendations. summary of background data. there is considerable controversy regarding indication for surgery, role for decompression alone, and decompression with fusion with or without instrumentation. methods. review of english language medical literature. results. the condition may stabilize itself with the collapse of the disc spaces and osteophytes but may continue to progress in nearly a third of the cases. it may cause predominantly back pain due to segmental instability, or radicular pain/neurogenic claudication secondary to root entrapment or spinal stenosis. when conservative treatment fails, the mainstay of surgical treatment is decompressive laminectomy and fusion, with or without instrumentation. conclusions. decompression primarily relieves radicular symptoms and neurogenic claudication whereas fusion primarily relieves back pain by elimination of instability. the goals for instrumentation are to promote fusion and to correct deformity. fusion has a better long-term outcome than decompression alone. there is evidence that instrumentation improves fusion rate but does not improve clinical outcome in a relatively short-term follow-up. however, outcome of pseudarthrosis cases deteriorates over time and solid fusion produces better long-term outcome. the benefit of instrumentation comes with a price of higher postoperative morbidity and complication rate. bone morphogenetic proteins are being tried to increase the rate of fusion, without increasing the complication rate, but the cost is prohibitive. more recently, dynamic stabilization with instrumentation but without fusion has been introduced as an alternative treatment. the current trends of surgical treatment and controversies are discussed.
precise and efficient nucleotide substitution near genomic nick via noncanonical homology-directed repair. targeted genome editing technologies have enabled a broad range of research and medical applications. the cas9 nuclease from the microbial crispr-cas system is targeted to specific genomic loci by a 20 nt guide sequence, which can tolerate certain mismatches to the dna target and thereby promote undesired off-target mutagenesis. here, we describe an approach that combines a cas9 nickase mutant with paired guide rnas to introduce targeted double-strand breaks. because individual nicks in the genome are repaired with high fidelity, simultaneous nicking via appropriately offset guide rnas is required for double-stranded breaks and extends the number of specifically recognized bases for target cleavage. we demonstrate that using paired nicking can reduce off-target activity by 50- to 1,500-fold in cell lines and to facilitate gene knockout in mouse zygotes without sacrificing on-target cleavage efficiency. this versatile strategy enables a wide variety of genome editing applications that require high specificity.

cigarette smoke induction of interleukin-27/wsx-1 regulates the differentiation of th1 and th17 cells in a smoking mouse model of emphysema studies have focused on the events that influence the development of interleukin 17 (il-17)–producing t helper cells (th-17 cells) associated with autoimmunity, such as experimental autoimmune encephalitis, but relatively little is known about the cytokines that antagonize th-17 cell effector responses. here we show that il-27 receptor–deficient mice chronically infected with toxoplasma gondii developed severe neuroinflammation that was cd4+ t cell dependent and was associated with a prominent il-17 response. in vitro, treatment of naive primary t cells with il-27 suppressed the development th-17 cells induced by il-6 and transforming growth factor-β, which was dependent on the intracellular signaling molecule stat1 but was independent of inhibition of il-6 signaling mediated by the suppressor protein socs3. thus il-27, a potent inhibitor of th-17 cell development, may be a useful target for treating inflammatory diseases mediated by these cells.
power efficiency of outer hair cell somatic electromotility 1. the microchamber method was used to examine the motile responses of isolated guinea pig outer hair cells to electrical stimulation. in the microchamber method, an isolated cell is drawn partway into a suction pipette and stimulated transcellularly. the relative position of the cell in the microchamber is referred to as the exclusion fraction. 2. the length changes of the included and excluded segments were compared for constant sinusoidal stimulus amplitude as functions of the exclusion fraction. both included and excluded segments showed maximal responses when the cell was excluded approximately halfway. both segments showed smaller or absent responses when the cell was almost fully excluded or almost fully included. 3. when the cell was near to, but not at, the maximum exclusion, the included segment response amplitude was zero, whereas the excluded segment response amplitude was nonzero. in contrast, when the cell was nearly fully included, the excluded segment response amplitude was zero, but the included segment response amplitude was still detectable. a simple model of outer hair cell motility based on these results suggests that the cell has finite-resistance terminations and that the motors are restricted to a region above the nucleus and below its ciliated apex (cuticular plate). 4. the function describing length change as a function of command voltage was measured for each segment as the exclusion fraction was varied. the functions were similar at midrange exclusions (i.e., when the segments were about equal length), showing nonlinearity and saturability. the functions were strikingly different when the segment lengths were different. the effects of exclusion on the voltage to length-change functions suggested that the nonlinearity and saturability are local properties of the motility mechanism. 5. the diameter changes of both segments were examined. the segment diameter changes were always antiphasic to the length changes. this finding implies that the motility mechanism has an active antiphasic diameter component. the diameter change amplitude was a monotonically increasing function of exclusion for the included segment, and a decreasing function for the excluded segment. 6. the voltage to length-change and voltage to diameter-change functions were measured for the same cell and exclusion fraction. the voltage to diameter-change function was smaller in amplitude than the voltage to length-change function. the functions were of opposite polarity to each other, but were otherwise similar in character. thus it is likely that the same motor mechanism is responsible for both axial and diameter deformations.
recognizing player goals in open-ended digital games with markov logic networks goal recognition for dialogue systems needs to be fast, make early predictions, and be portable. we present initial work which shows that using statistical, corpus-based methods to build goal recognizers may be a viable way to meet those needs. our goal recognizer is trained on data from apian corpus and then used to determine the agent's most likely goal based on that data. the algorithm is linear in the number of goals, and performs very well in terms of accuracy and early prediction. in addition, it is more easily portable to new domains as does not require a hand-crafted plan library.
ho x observations over west africa during amma: impact of isoprene and no x the measurement of oh reactivity, the inverse of the oh lifetime, provides a powerful tool to investigate atmospheric photochemistry. a new airborne oh reactivity instrument was designed and deployed for the first time on the nasa dc-8 aircraft during the second phase of inter- continental chemical transport experiment-b (intex-b) campaign, which was focused on the asian pollution out- flow over pacific ocean and was based in hawaii and alaska. the oh reactivity was measured by adding oh, generated by photolyzing water vapor with 185 nm uv light in a moveable wand, to the flow of ambient air in a flow tube and mea- suring the oh signal with laser induced fluorescence. as the wand was pulled back away from the oh detector, the oh signal decay was recorded; the slope of 1ln(signal)/1 time was the oh reactivity. the overall absolute uncer- tainty at the 2 confidence levels is about 1 s 1 at low al- titudes (for decay about 6 s 1 ), and 0.7 s 1 at high altitudes (for decay about 2 s 1 ). from the median vertical profile obtained in the second phase of intex-b, the measured oh reactivity (4.0±1.0 s 1 ) is higher than the oh reactiv-
mrc1 marks early-firing origins and coordinates timing and efficiency of initiation in fission yeast † the swi1‐swi3 replication fork protection complex and mrc1 protein are required for stabilization of stalled replication forks in fission yeast. hsk1 kinase also plays roles in checkpoint responses elicited by arrested replication forks. we show that both swi1 and swi3, the abundance of which are interdependent, are required for chromatin association of mrc1. co‐immunoprecipitation experiments show the interactions of swi1‐swi3, mrc1 and hsk1. mrc1 interacts with swi3 and hsk1 proteins through its central segment (378–879) containing a sq/tq cluster, and this segment is sufficient for checkpoint reaction. the sq/tq cluster segment (536–673) is essential but not sufficient for the interactions and for resistance to replication inhibitor hydroxyurea. mrc1 protein level is increased in hsk1–89 cells due to apparent stabilization, and we have identified a potential phosphodegron sequence. these results suggest that interactions of the swi1‐swi3 complex and hsk1 kinase with mrc1 may play a role in cellular responses to stalled replication forks in fission yeast.
rice osfls2-mediated perception of bacterial flagellins is evaded by xanthomonas oryzae pvs. oryzae and oryzicola. the bacterial flagellin (flic) epitopes flg22 and flgii-28 are microbe-associated molecular patterns (mamps). although flg22 is recognized by many plant species via the pattern recognition receptor fls2, neither the flgii-28 receptor nor the extent of flgii-28 recognition by different plant families is known. here, we tested the significance of flgii-28 as a mamp and the importance of allelic diversity in flg22 and flgii-28 in plant-pathogen interactions using purified peptides and a pseudomonas syringae ∆flic mutant complemented with different flic alleles. the plant genotype and allelic diversity in flg22 and flgii-28 were found to significantly affect the plant immune response, but not bacterial motility. the recognition of flgii-28 is restricted to a number of solanaceous species. although the flgii-28 peptide does not trigger any immune response in arabidopsis, mutations in both flg22 and flgii-28 have fls2-dependent effects on virulence. however, the expression of a tomato allele of fls2 does not confer to nicotiana benthamiana the ability to detect flgii-28, and tomato plants silenced for fls2 are not altered in flgii-28 recognition. therefore, mamp diversification is an effective pathogen virulence strategy, and flgii-28 appears to be perceived by an as yet unidentified receptor in the solanaceae, although it has an fls2-dependent virulence effect in arabidopsis.
cellular sources of dysregulated cytokines in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis multiple sclerosis (ms) clusters with the so-called complex genetic diseases, a group of common disorders characterized by modest disease risk heritability and multifaceted gene-environment interactions. the major histocompatibility complex (mhc) is the only genomic region consistently associated with ms, and susceptible mhc haplotypes have been identified. although the mhc does not account for all genetic contribution to ms, the other genetic contributors have been elusive. microarray gene-expression studies, which also have not identified a major ms locus, have, however, been promising in elucidating some of the possible pathways involved in the disease. yet, microarray studies thus far have been unable to separate the genetic causes of ms from the expression consequences of ms. the use of new methodologies and technologies to refine the phenotype, such as brain spectroscopy, pet and functional magnetic resonance imaging combined with novel computational tools and a better understanding of the human genome architecture, may help resolve the genetic causes of ms.
outreach and support in south london (oasis). outcomes of non-attenders to a service for people at high risk of psychosis: the case for a more assertive approach to assessment. background while recent research points to the potential benefits of clinical intervention before the first episode of psychosis, the logistical feasibility of this is unclear.   aims to assess the feasibility of providing a clinical service for people with prodromal symptoms in an inner city area where engagement with mental health services is generally poor.   method following a period of liaison with local agencies to promote the service, referrals were assessed and managed in a primary care setting. activity of the service was audited over 30 months.   results people with prodromal symptoms were referred by a range of community agencies and seen at their local primary care physician practice. over 30 months, 180 clients were referred; 58 (32.2%) met criteria for an at risk mental state, most of whom (67.2%) had attenuated psychotic symptoms. almost 30% were excluded due to current or previous psychotic illness, of which two-thirds were in the first episode of psychosis. the socio-demographic composition of the 'at risk' group reflected that of the local population, with an over-representation of clients from an ethnic minority. over 90% of suitable clients remained engaged with the service after 1 year.   conclusion it is feasible to provide a clinical service for people with prodromal symptoms in a deprived inner city area with a large ethnic minority population.
molecular cloning of two structure variants of crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (chh) from the swimming crab (portunus trituberculatus), and their gene expression during molting and ovarian development the present work shows for the first time that peptides belonging to the crustacean hyperglycaemic hormone family (chh-family hormones) from penaeus japonicus affect protein and mrna synthesis in in vitro-incubated ovarian explant fragments removed from vitellogenic females of penaeus semisulcatus. reduced levels of protein synthesis, determined by tca-precipitable 35s-labeled proteins, were found in the presence of crude sinus gland extracts from both p. semisulcatus and p. japonicus. a similar inhibitory effect compared to controls was found with each of the seven chh-family peptides. non-chh-family peptides did not reduce protein synthesis. crude sinus gland extracts prepared from p. semisulcatus were at least 20-fold more effective than sinus gland extracts of p. japonicus. the inhibition level was directly related to the concentration of the peptide in the incubation media, but its degree varied among the different tested peptides. the profile of proteins synthesized during in vitro incubation was analyzed using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denatured and reduced conditions (sds-page), followed by autoradiography. synthesis of several proteins was reduced, including proteins with electrophoretic mobility similar to that of vitellin. immunoprecipitation with antiserum prepared against native ovarian vitellin confirmed the inhibitory effect of chh-family peptides on vitellin synthesis. the crude sinus gland extract and chh-family peptides also inhibited rna synthesis, as determined by [3h]uridine incorporation into mrna of ovarian fragments. it is concluded that in addition to their role in carbohydrate metabolism, chh-family peptides may also influence ovarian physiology in crustaceans.
nf-kappab, and not mycn, regulates mhc class i and endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidases in human neuroblastoma cells. the endoplasmic reticulum (er) aminopeptidases erap1 and erap2 contribute to generate hla class i binding peptides. recently, we have shown that the expression of these enzymes is high and coordinated (with each other and with hla class i molecules) in immortalized b cells, but variable and imbalanced in human tumour cell lines of various non‐lymphoid lineages. herein, this issue was investigated in vivo by testing erap1 and erap2 expression in normal non‐lymphoid tissues and their malignant counterparts. erap1 and erap2 were detected exclusively in the epithelial cells of over half of the tested normal tissues. four erap1/erap2 phenotypes (+/+, −/−, +/− and −/+) were detected, and the presence of either or both enzymes was not necessarily associated with hla class i expression. in more than 160 neoplastic lesions, the expression of either or both aminopeptidases was retained, lost (most frequently, particularly erap1) or acquired as compared to the normal counterparts, depending on the tumour histotype. the double‐negative (−/−) phenotype was the most frequent, and significantly (p = 0.013) associated with a lack of detectable hla class i antigens. in selected neoplastic lesions, erap1 and erap2 were also tested for their enzymatic (peptide‐trimming) activities. expression and function were found to correlate, indicating that immunohistochemistry detects active enzymes in vivo. thus, dissociation in the expression of erap1, erap2 and hla class i may already be present in some normal tissues, but malignant transformation causes additional losses, gains and imbalances in specific tumour histotypes, and these alter the peptide‐trimming ability of tumour cells in vivo. j. cell. physiol. 216: 742–749, 2008, © 2008 wiley‐liss, inc.
inter‐ and intramuscular differences in training‐induced hypertrophy of the quadriceps femoris: association with muscle activation during the first training session summaryfour male subjects aged 23–34 years were studied during 60 days of unilateral strength training and 40 days of detraining. training was carried out four times a week and consisted of six series of ten maximal isokinetic knee extensions at an angular velocity of 2.09 rad·s−1. at the start and at every 20th day of training and detraining, isometric maximal voluntary contraction (mvc), integrated electromyographic activity (iemg) and quadriceps muscle cross-sectional area (csa) assessed at seven fractions of femur length (lf), by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, were measured on both trained (t) and untrained (ut) legs. isokinetic torques at 30° before full knee extension were measured before and at the end of training at: 0, 1.05, 2.09, 3.14, 4.19, 5.24 rad·s−1. after 60 days t leg csa had increased by 8.5%±1.4% (mean±sem,n=4,p<0.001), iemg by 42.4%±16.5% (p<0.01) and mvc by 20.8%±5.4% (p<0.01). changes during detraining had a similar time course to those of training. no changes in ut leg csa were observed while iemg and mvc increased by 24.8%±10% (n.s.) and 8.7%±4.3% (n.s.), respectively. the increase in quadriceps muscle csa was maximal at 2/10 lf (12.0%±1.5%,p<0.01) and minimal, proximally to the knee, at 8/10 lf (3.5%±1.2%, n.s.). preferential hypertrophy of the vastus medialis and intermedius muscles compared to those of the rectus femoris and lateralis muscles was observed. isoangular torque of t leg increased by 20.9%±5.4% (p<0.05), 23.8%±7.8% (p<0.05) and 22.5%±6.7% (p<0.05) at 0, 1.05 and 2.09 rad·s−1 respectively; no significant change was observed at higher velocities and in the ut leg. hypertrophy produced by strength training accounts for 40% of the increase in force while the remaining 60% seems to be attributable to an increased neural drive and possibly to changes in muscle architecture.
conserved and muscle-group-specific gene expression patterns shape postnatal development of the novel extraocular muscle phenotype. abstract the genetic and epigenetic influences that establish and maintain the unique phenotype of the extraocular muscles (eoms) are poorly understood. the vestibulo-ocular reflex (vor) represents an important input into the eoms, as it stabilizes eye position relative to the environment and provides a platform for function of all other eye movement systems. a role for vestibular cues in shaping eom maturation was assessed in these studies using the ototoxic nitrile compound 3’,3’-iminodipropionitrile (idpn) to eliminate the receptor hair cells that drive the vestibulo-ocular reflex. intraperitoneal injections of idpn were followed by a 2-week survival period, after which myosin heavy chain (myhc) analysis of the eoms was performed. when idpn was administered to juvenile rats, the proportion of eye muscle fibers expressing developmental and fast myosins was increased, while eom-specific myhc mrna levels were downregulated. by contrast, idpn treatment in adult rats affected only the proportion of fibers expressing developmental myhc isoforms, leaving the eom-specific myhc mrna unaltered. these data provide evidence that the vor modulates eom-specific myhc expression in development. the lack of significant changes in eom-specific myhc expression in adult eom following idpn administration suggests that there may be a critical period during development when alterations in vestibular activity have significant and permanent consequences for the eye muscles.
cyclin d1 as a genetic modifier in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. germ‐line mutations in mlh1 and msh2 genes predispose to hereditary non‐polyposis colorectal cancer (hnpcc) syndrome, but they do not predict a specific phenotype of the disease. we speculated that the ataxia‐telangiectasia mutated gene (atm) was a candidate gene to modulate the phenotypic expression of hnpcc, as heterozygous individuals for germ‐line atm mutations have been considered at higher risk of developing epithelial malignancies. the frequency of the atm d1853n polymorphism was evaluated in 167 individuals from 20 hnpcc families in which mlh1 or msh2 germ‐line mutations co‐segregated with the disease. among the 67 mlh1 or msh2 mutation carriers, the atm 1853n variant was associated with a significantly higher incidence of colorectal and other hnpcc‐related cancers, when compared with individuals carrying the atm 1853d variant [12/13 (92%) vs. 31/54 (57.5%); p = 0.02]. mlh1 and msh2 mutation carriers who concomitantly carried the atm 1853n variant, had an 8 times increased risk of developing colorectal and other hnpcc‐related cancers (or: 8.9; p = 0.02), when compared with mlh1 or msh2 mutation carriers with the atm 1853d variant. our results suggest that the atm d1853n polymorphism modulates the penetrance of mlh1 and msh2 germ‐line mutations. int. j. cancer 88:928–931, 2000. © 2000 wiley‐liss, inc.
clostridium difficile heterogeneously impacts intestinal community architecture but drives stable metabolome responses defining the functional status of host-associated microbial ecosystems has proven challenging owing to the vast number of predicted genes within the microbiome and relatively poor understanding of community dynamics and community–host interaction. metabolomic approaches, in which a large number of small molecule metabolites can be defined in a biological sample, offer a promising avenue to ‘fingerprint’ microbiota functional status. here, we examined the effects of the human gut microbiota on the fecal and urinary metabolome of a humanized (hum) mouse using an optimized ultra performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry-based method. differences between hum and conventional mouse urine and fecal metabolomic profiles support host-specific aspects of the microbiota’s metabolomic contribution, consistent with distinct microbial compositions. comparison of microbiota composition and metabolome of mice humanized with different human donors revealed that the vast majority of metabolomic features observed in donor samples are produced in the corresponding hum mice, and individual-specific features suggest ‘personalized’ aspects of functionality can be reconstituted in mice. feeding the mice a defined, custom diet resulted in modification of the metabolite signatures, illustrating that host diet provides an avenue for altering gut microbiota functionality, which in turn can be monitored via metabolomics. using a defined model microbiota consisting of one or two species, we show that simplified communities can drive major changes in the host metabolomic profile. our results demonstrate that metabolomics constitutes a powerful avenue for functional characterization of the intestinal microbiota and its interaction with the host.
application of constructed wetlands for treating agricultural runoff and agro-industrial wastewater: a review subsurface horizontal flow reed beds are being evaluated for nitrogen (n) and phosphorus (p) removal from plant nursery runoff water in new south wales australia. the need to include plants (phragmites australis), the effect of reaction time (3.5 v 7.0 d) and dissolved organic carbon (doc) on n and p removal in batch fed gravel wetland tubs (55 l) was studied over 19 months. simulated nursery runoff water containing n (10.1 mg l(-1), 74% as no3) and p (0.58 mg l(-1), 88% as po4) and doc (2-5 mg l(-1)) was used. the planted wetland tubs removed >96% tn and tp over most of the 19-month study period while unplanted tubs were inefficient (<16% n and <45% p removal) and occasionally discharged nutrients. doubling the reaction time to 7.0 days had no effect on nutrient removal. plant nutrient uptake accounted for most of the n (76%) and p (86%) removed while roots and rhizomes were the dominant sink (n 58%, p 67%). the addition of methanol (c:n-3:1) to unplanted tubs achieved 81-98% n removal. in carbon limited low nutrient nursery runoff, plants were essential to a gravel-based wetland to achieve efficient nutrient removal with effluent tn and tp concentrations of <1 mg l(-1) and 0.05 mg l(-1), respectively with a 3.5 day reaction time.
understanding e-book continuance intention: empirical evidence from e-book users in a developing country this paper examines cognitive beliefs and affect influencing one's intention to continue using (continuance) information systems (is). expectation-confirmation theory is adapted from the consumer behavior literature and integrated with theoretical and empirical findings from prior is usage research to theorize a model of is continuance. five research hypotheses derived from this model are empirically validated using a field survey of online banking users. the results suggest that users' continuance intention is determined by their satisfaction with is use and perceived usefulness of continued is use. user satisfaction, in turn, is influenced by their confirmation of expectation from prior is use and perceived usefulness. post-acceptance perceived usefulness is influenced by users' confirmation level. this study draws attention to the substantive differences between acceptance and continuance behaviors, theorizes and validates one of the earliest theoretical models of is continuance, integrates confirmation and user satisfaction constructs within our current understanding of is use, conceptualizes and creates an initial scale for measuring is continuance, and offers an initial explanation for the acceptance-discontinuance anomaly.
a radial head prosthesis appears to be unnecessary in mason-iv fracture dislocation background metal prostheses are useful for restoring elbow and forearm stability when the radial head cannot be fixed after a fracture. because the anatomy of the radial head is difficult to reproduce with a prosthesis, two different options have been proposed: a bipolar prosthesis with a fixed stem and a mobile head, and a monoblock prosthesis with a smooth stem that is intentionally fixed loosely in the neck of the radius. one concern with a fixed-stem implant with a mobile head has been the risk of osteolysis. the purpose of this study was to evaluate radiographic changes reflecting or suggesting progressive osteolysis in patients with a bipolar radial head prosthesis.   methods the functional and radiographic outcomes following treatment of fifty-one comminuted fractures of the radial head with a bipolar radial head prosthesis in fifty-one consecutive patients were evaluated at a mean of 8.4 years postoperatively. there were eleven isolated comminuted fractures involving the entire radial head. thirty-four fractures were associated with a posterior elbow dislocation, and six patients had a posterior monteggia lesion.   results according to the mayo elbow performance index, fourteen elbows were graded as excellent; twenty-five, as good; nine, as fair; and three, as poor. radiographic changes reflecting or suggesting progressive osteolysis were present in thirty-seven patients. complications occurred in ten patients, but only one underwent surgical treatment, for an ulnar neuropathy.   conclusions although satisfactory midterm functional results were achieved in thirty-nine of the fifty-one patients, the high prevalence of adverse radiographic changes suggesting periprosthetic osteolysis should alert clinicians to this possible drawback of the use of bipolar radial head prostheses, especially in young and/or active patients.
phylogeographical patterns shed light on evolutionary process in south america the making of amazonian diversity the biodiversity of the amazon basin is legendary, but the processes by which it has been generated have been debated. in the late 20th century the prevalent view was that the engine of diversity was repeated contraction and expansion of forest refugia during the past 3 million years or so. hoorn et al. (p. 927) analyze findings from a diverse range of disciplines, including molecular phylogeny, ecology, sedimentology, structural geology, and palaeontology, to offer an overview of the entire history of this region during the cenozoic era (66 million years ago). the uplift of the andes was a pivotal event in the evolution of amazonian landscapes because it continually altered river drainage patterns, which in turn put a variety of pressures on organisms to adapt to changing conditions in a multiplicity of ways. hence, the diversity of the modern biota of the amazon has more ancient origins than previously thought. the amazonian rainforest is arguably the most species-rich terrestrial ecosystem in the world, yet the timing of the origin and evolutionary causes of this diversity are a matter of debate. we review the geologic and phylogenetic evidence from amazonia and compare it with uplift records from the andes. this uplift and its effect on regional climate fundamentally changed the amazonian landscape by reconfiguring drainage patterns and creating a vast influx of sediments into the basin. on this “andean” substrate, a region-wide edaphic mosaic developed that became extremely rich in species, particularly in western amazonia. we show that andean uplift was crucial for the evolution of amazonian landscapes and ecosystems, and that current biodiversity patterns are rooted deep in the pre-quaternary.
oxidative stress in mouse liver caused by dietary amino acid deprivation: protective effect of methionine two-dimensional non-equilibrium ph gel electrophoresis (2d-nephge) analysis was used to evaluate the effects of dietary protein depletion on the protein composition of mouse liver cytosol. analysing the cytosol from both normal and protein depleted liver, the position in gels of more than three hundred protein spots was determined. after 5 days of protein depletion, about 20% of the spots either increased or decreased more than 2 fold. five spots of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) were recognised by specific antibodies. the glutathione s-transferase (gsts) subunits yb1, yc and yf were identified by the simultaneous analysis of both glutathione-binding cytosolic proteins and the corresponding standards. as estimated by internal optical density (iod) of spots, the changes caused by protein depletion in gapdh and gst subunit contents were similar to those obtained by other methods. by means of mass spectrometric analysis of tryptic peptides generated from spots and/or comparison of two-dimensional gel electrophoretic patterns, carbonic anhydrase iii (caiii), cu, zn superoxide dismutase (cuznsod) and a cytochrome p450 cytosolic protein (cyt p450) were identified. these three proteins, as well as gsts, are related with intracellular detoxification and free radical scavenging systems. their contents were regulated by dietary protein restriction in a manner indicative of diminished liver defence against oxidising agents.
the effect of high-intensity aerobic interval training on markers of systemic inflammation in sedentary populations purposelong-term physical activity is reported to improve chronic systemic inflammation, which provides protection against the ensuing development of chronic disease. accordingly, the present study assessed changes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, aerobic capacity and body composition following 8 weeks of either small-sided games (ssg) or cycling (cyc) training compared to a sedentary control (con) condition.methodsthirty-three middle-aged, sedentary men were randomized into cyc (n = 11), ssg (n = 11), or con (n = 11) conditions. the cyc and ssg conditions trained 3 days/week for 8 weeks, whilst con maintained habitual activity and dietary patterns. pre- and post-intervention testing included a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan, sub-maximal (80 % maximal heart rate) aerobic capacity (vo2) and fasting venous blood. venous blood measures for pro-inflammatory markers included c-reactive protein (crp), interleukin (il)-6, il-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and leptin; anti-inflammatory markers included il-10, il-1 receptor agonist, and adiponectin.resultsboth cyc and ssg increased submaximal power output and vo2 (p < 0.05), decreased total body fat-mass (tb-fm; p < 0.05), and crp (ssg, −0.45 ± 0.42 mg l−1; p = 0.008; cyc, −0.44 ± 0.59 mg l−1; p = 0.02). only ssg increased total body fat-free mass (tb-ffm; +1.1 ± 1.2 kg; p = 0.001) and decreased concentration of plasma il-6 (−0.69 ± 0.62 pg ml−1; p = 0.002) and leptin (−2,212 ± 2,531 ng ml−1; p = 0.014).conclusioncycling and ssg training were both effective at improving crp, vo2 and tb-fm. furthermore, ssg training has also shown to be an effective training approach in reducing il-6 and leptin and increasing muscle mass within sedentary, middle-aged men.
constraint satisfaction parameterized by solution size we study the complexity of local search for the boolean constraint satisfaction problem (csp), in the following form: given a csp instance, that is, a collection of constraints, and a solution to it, the question is whether there is a better (lighter, i.e., having strictly less hamming weight) solution within a given distance from the initial solution. we classify the complexity, both classical and parameterized, of such problems by a schaefer-style dichotomy result, that is, with a restricted set of allowed types of constraints. our results show that there is a considerable amount of such problems that are np-hard, but fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the distance.
women-specific hiv/aids services: identifying and defining the components of holistic service delivery for women living with hiv/aids specialized substance abuse treatment programs have been developed for women within the past two decades. this article presents the results of a secondary analysis of a regional database of drug abuse treatment programs that compared the characteristics of women-only (wo) and mixed-gender (mg) programs across three treatment modalities. in general, wo programs differed from mg programs in their policies regarding fees, sources of payment, special populations served, services offered, and treatment capacity, process, and duration. the differences in program characteristics reflect broader societal gender differences, including women's generally lower economic status and primary responsibility for child-rearing.
tradeoffs between the axial resolution and the signal-to-noise ratio in elastography this paper presents a theoretical framework for performance characterization in strain estimation, which includes the effect of signal decorrelation, quantization errors due to the finite temporal sampling rate, and electronic noise. an upper bound on the performance of the strain estimator in elastography is obtained from a strain filter constructed using these limits. the strain filter is a term used to describe the nonlinear filtering process in the strain domain (due to the ultrasound system and signal processing parameters) that allows the elastographic depiction of a limited range of strains from the compressed tissue. the strain filter predicts the elastogram quality by specifying the elastographic signal-to-noise ratio (snr/sub e/), sensitivity, and the strain dynamic range at a given resolution. the dynamic range is limited by decorrelation errors for large tissue strain values, and electronic noise for low strain values. tradeoffs between different techniques used to enhance elastogram image quality may also be analyzed using the strain filter.
the role of salivary histatin and the human cathelicidin ll-37 in wound healing and innate immunity extracellular atp, released at sites of inflammation or tissue damage, activates the p2x7 receptor, which in turn triggers a range of responses also including cell proliferation. in this study the ability of the human cathelicidin ll-37 to stimulate fibroblast growth was inhibited by commonly used p2x7 blockers. we investigated the structural requirements of the growth-promoting activity of ll-37 and found that it did not depend on helix sense (the all-d analog was active) but did require a strong helix-forming propensity in aqueous solution (a scrambled analog and primate ll-37 orthologs devoid of this property were inactive). the involvement of p2x7 was analyzed using p2x7-expressing hek293 cells. ll-37 induced proliferation of these cells, triggered ca2+ influx, promoted ethidium bromide uptake, and synergized with benzoyl atp to enhance the pore and channel functions of p2x7. the activity of ll-37 had an absolute requirement for p2x7 expression as it was blocked by the p2x7 inhibitor kn-62, was absent in cells lacking p2x7, and was restored by p2x7 transfection. of particular interest, ll-37 led to pore-forming activity in cells expressing a truncated p2x7 receptor unable to generate the non-selective pore typical of the full-length receptor. our results indicate that p2x7 is involved in the proliferative cell response to ll-37 and that the structural/aggregational properties of ll-37 determine its capacity to modulate the activation state of p2x7.
frugivory in polychrotid lizards: effects of body size animal diets crucially affect fitness, yet many aspects of their ultimate determinants are unknown. the distribution and extent of herbivory in lizards, its evolutionary history, and ecological factors that may favour it are discussed. most lizards are exclusively or primarily carnivorous, yet many species eat some plants and a few are almost exclusively herbivorous. based on a literature survey of diets of over 450 lizard species, the distribution and degree of omnivory and herbivory are described. some plants occur in the diets of slightly over half of lizard species, and plants formed 10% or more of the dietary volume of 12.1% of species, and 90% or more of the diet of 0.8% of species. the greatest percentage of omnivorous species (> 10% plant diet), over 30% in each, and highest mean percentage plant matter in the diet are in iguanidae, corytophanidae, gerrhosauridae, agamidae, xantusiidae, and tropiduridae. numerous other omnivores occur in lacertidae and scincidae and fewer in several additional families. herbivorous lizards (> 90% plant volume) tend to be folivorous and to possess adaptations for processing leaves, including specialized dentition for cutting or reducing leaves, elongated intestines, colic valves that slow passage of food, and intestinal flora that digest cellulose. omnivorous lizards lacking such specializations may eat some leaves, but consume much more fruit, flowers, and seeds, plant parts that are easy to digest, likely to be very abundant seasonally, and may be highly nutritious. some lizards eat nectar and pollen; even sap is eaten by at least one gecko. ontogenetic increase in plant consumption and decrease in prey consumption is known, but its generality has been controversial. such ontogeny has been demonstrated in three iguanid species, a skink, a lacertid, two tropidurids, a phrynosomatid, and two corytophanids, but it does not occur in some other species. thus, the presences of ontogenetic variation must be evaluated for each species. the importance of specific foods may also vary with age. omnivory and/or herbivory have originated in many lizard families, with at least nine origins in iguania and 23 in scleroglossa. origins have been rare in gekkonoidea and anguimorpha and common in scincomorpha, especially in lacertidae and scincidae. losses of omnivory have been much less frequent than gains. only a few origins can account for all the herbivory in lizards. concentrated changes tests show that there is a significant association in lacertidae, lacertiformes, lacertoidea, scincidae, and scleroglossa between insularity and omnivory. insular lizards may broaden their diets to compensate for limited availability of prey. addition of other factors that reduce availability of prey, i.e. extreme aridity and cave-dwelling, to insularity, strengthened the relationship to omnivory in lacertidae and lacertoidea. we were unable to demonstrate a role of aridity independent of insularity, but present anecdotal evidence suggests that it may promote evolution of plant consumption. large body size in lizards has long been associated with herbivory, and more recently, with omnivory in lacertid lizards. using a conventional regression approach in which each species is considered to supply an independent data point, this relationship was confirmed for all lizards. although larger species have diets with more plants, plant consumption accounts for only 9% of the variation in body length, which is not surprising given that other factors such as predation, competition, and sexual selection affect body size. the frequency of transitions body size associated with transitions to ominivory or carnivory was also examined. in iguania, scleroglossa, and all lizards, transitions supporting the hypothesis that omnivory favours increase in body size were significantly more frequent than nonsupporting transitions. this suggests that substantial plant consumption favours evolution of larger size, probably because of the energetic considerations first presented by pough (1973). because actively foraging lizards move widely through the habitat to locate prey and tongue-flick to locate prey by chemical cues, we
generalized likelihood ratio statistics and uncertainty adjustments in efficient adaptive design of clinical trials adaptive designs have been proposed for clinical trials in which the nuisance parameters or alternative of interest are unknown or likely to be misspecified before the trial. although most previous works on adaptive designs and mid-course sample size re-estimation have focused on two-stage or group-sequential designs in the normal case, we consider here a new approach that involves at most three stages and is developed in the general framework of multiparameter exponential families. this approach not only maintains the prescribed type i error probability but also provides a simple but asymptotically efficient sequential test whose finite-sample performance, measured in terms of the expected sample size and power functions, is shown to be comparable to the optimal sequential design, determined by dynamic programming, in the simplified normal mean case with known variance and prespecified alternative, and superior to the existing two-stage designs and also to adaptive group-sequential designs when the alternative or nuisance parameters are unknown or misspecified.
well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma presenting as branched eyelid cutaneous horn: a case report with review of literature a cutaneous horn is a protrusion from the skin made up of cornified material. these horns can be derived from a variety of epidermal lesions, both benign and malignant. this historical article reviews a number of early instances of cutaneous horns, some reported in the 16th and 17th centuries. the danish anatomist thomas bartholin was the first to have a correct theory of the ethiology of these horny growths, and the english surgeons john hunter and everard home confirmed his findings in the late 18th century.
clostridium difficile heterogeneously impacts intestinal community architecture but drives stable metabolome responses defining the functional status of host-associated microbial ecosystems has proven challenging owing to the vast number of predicted genes within the microbiome and relatively poor understanding of community dynamics and community–host interaction. metabolomic approaches, in which a large number of small molecule metabolites can be defined in a biological sample, offer a promising avenue to ‘fingerprint’ microbiota functional status. here, we examined the effects of the human gut microbiota on the fecal and urinary metabolome of a humanized (hum) mouse using an optimized ultra performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry-based method. differences between hum and conventional mouse urine and fecal metabolomic profiles support host-specific aspects of the microbiota’s metabolomic contribution, consistent with distinct microbial compositions. comparison of microbiota composition and metabolome of mice humanized with different human donors revealed that the vast majority of metabolomic features observed in donor samples are produced in the corresponding hum mice, and individual-specific features suggest ‘personalized’ aspects of functionality can be reconstituted in mice. feeding the mice a defined, custom diet resulted in modification of the metabolite signatures, illustrating that host diet provides an avenue for altering gut microbiota functionality, which in turn can be monitored via metabolomics. using a defined model microbiota consisting of one or two species, we show that simplified communities can drive major changes in the host metabolomic profile. our results demonstrate that metabolomics constitutes a powerful avenue for functional characterization of the intestinal microbiota and its interaction with the host.
application of constructed wetlands for treating agricultural runoff and agro-industrial wastewater: a review subsurface horizontal flow reed beds are being evaluated for nitrogen (n) and phosphorus (p) removal from plant nursery runoff water in new south wales australia. the need to include plants (phragmites australis), the effect of reaction time (3.5 v 7.0 d) and dissolved organic carbon (doc) on n and p removal in batch fed gravel wetland tubs (55 l) was studied over 19 months. simulated nursery runoff water containing n (10.1 mg l(-1), 74% as no3) and p (0.58 mg l(-1), 88% as po4) and doc (2-5 mg l(-1)) was used. the planted wetland tubs removed >96% tn and tp over most of the 19-month study period while unplanted tubs were inefficient (<16% n and <45% p removal) and occasionally discharged nutrients. doubling the reaction time to 7.0 days had no effect on nutrient removal. plant nutrient uptake accounted for most of the n (76%) and p (86%) removed while roots and rhizomes were the dominant sink (n 58%, p 67%). the addition of methanol (c:n-3:1) to unplanted tubs achieved 81-98% n removal. in carbon limited low nutrient nursery runoff, plants were essential to a gravel-based wetland to achieve efficient nutrient removal with effluent tn and tp concentrations of <1 mg l(-1) and 0.05 mg l(-1), respectively with a 3.5 day reaction time.
predictors of postprandial hypotension in elderly patients with de novo parkinson’s disease postprandial hypotension was first recognized as a clinical problem in 1977 in a patient with parkinson disease [1]. however, the hypotensive effect of meal ingestion has been appreciated for a longer time. in 1935, gladstone [2] described a hypertensive patient who had had a postprandial decrease in blood pressure from 185/120 mm hg to 145/80 mm hg. in 1953, smirk [3] observed a decrease in blood pressure after patients with autonomic failure ingested food. robertson and colleagues [4] confirmed these results in patients with chronic autonomic failure and found an average decrease in systolic blood pressure of 49 6 mm hg after a meal [4]. since lipsitz and colleagues [5] first described it in nursing home residents a decade ago, postprandial hypotension has become recognized as a common disorder of blood pressure regulation in the elderly [5]. our current understanding of postprandial hypotension is limited by the lack of a standardized, clinically meaningful definition. analogous to orthostatic hypotension, postprandial hypotension is commonly defined in the literature as a decrease in systolic blood pressure of 20 mm hg or more within 2 hours of the start of a meal. postprandial hypotension also develops when the absolute level of systolic blood pressure after a meal decreases to less than 90 mm hg and when the systolic blood pressure before a meal is greater than 100 mm hg. in addition, if a meal-related decrease in systolic blood pressure exceeds the threshold for cerebral autoregulation, patients may become symptomatic when the absolute systolic blood pressure level exceeds 90 mm hg or when the postprandial systolic blood pressure decreases to less than 20 mm hg. the frequent absence of symptoms associated with this decrease in blood pressure after meal ingestion makes the value of this definition uncertain. in addition, the morbidity and mortality related to postprandial hypotension are unknown. a potential cumulative effect of multiple hypotensive stresses, such as posture change or administration of medication at the time of meal ingestion, makes assessment of the clinical relevance of individual blood pressure responses to a meal even more difficult. although it can be exacerbated by posture change, postprandial hypotension is a distinct entity that differs from orthostatic hypotension. we have reviewed the current knowledge of the epidemiology, clinical symptoms and significance, pathophysiology, and management of postprandial hypotension. we hope to make the practicing physician more aware of this common abnormality in blood pressure regulation and to stimulate new research of its mechanisms and management. methods through a medline search, we identified all articles on postprandial hypertension published between 1966 and 1994. we also used the bibliographies of relevant articles. all articles and case reports describing meal-related hypotension in the elderly and in patients with autonomic failure were included for analysis. epidemiology and associated conditions during the past decade, hypotension in response to ingestion of a mixed meal or oral glucose has been shown in healthy elderly persons [6-14]; young and elderly persons with hypertension [10, 15-21]; elderly patients in nursing homes [5, 22-25]; and patients with postprandial syncope [26, 27], autonomic insufficiency [4, 28-36], parkinson disease [1, 37-39], paraplegia [40], diabetes mellitus [28, 38, 41], cardiovascular disease [42, 43], and renal failure treated with hemodialysis [44, 45]. however, the epidemiology of postprandial hypotension has not been thoroughly studied. mild, meal-induced decreases in blood pressure are common in healthy older persons [6-11], but the prevalence of these decreases is unknown. the presence of multiple illnesses in elderly persons may further impair cardiovascular adaptation to meal ingestion and result in marked postprandial decreases in blood pressure. investigations of elderly persons living in nursing homes have shown that nearly all persons experience some decrease in blood pressure [24, 25]. in 24% to 36% of these patients, systolic blood pressure decreases more than 20 mm hg within 75 minutes of eating a meal [24, 25]. it has been difficult to dissociate the effects of physiologic aging on postprandial blood pressure regulation from those of age-associated illnesses. the elevation in blood pressure associated with aging can profoundly influence postprandial blood pressure. in a study of 82 healthy persons aged 19 to 79 years, meal-related reductions in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly correlated. however, when the data were corrected for baseline blood pressure, this correlation was no longer seen [46]. older hypertensive persons have greater reductions in blood pressure after ingesting food or oral glucose than do age-matched normotensive persons [7, 9, 10, 17-20]. postprandial decreases in systolic blood pressure ranging from 17 to 25 mm hg have been found in hypertensive elderly patients older than age 65 years who did not have other overt cardiovascular diseases [9, 10, 17, 18]. in these patients, diastolic blood pressure may decrease as much as 15 mm hg. however, because hypertensive middle-aged and young persons also have postprandial decreases in blood pressure [10, 16], this phenomenon may be primarily caused by blood pressure elevation rather than by aging itself. profound postprandial hypotension has been observed in patients with autonomic failure [1, 4, 28-36, 47, 48]. the first case report described a 65-year-old man who had dizziness and visual disturbance associated with large decreases in blood pressure after almost every meal [1]. robertson and colleagues [4] found a marked postprandial decrease in sitting systolic blood pressure (range, 22 to 98 mm hg) in 10 patients with autonomic failure. hoeldtke and associates [28, 47] studied patients with multiple-system atrophy (the shy-drager syndrome) and pure autonomic failure and found that the decrease in the mean sitting postprandial arterial blood pressure ranged from 62 to 83 mm hg [28, 47]. all of these patients had blurred vision and dizziness after the meal [47]. postprandial hypotension is also commonly found in patients with peripheral neuropathy caused by diabetes mellitus or other disorders [28, 33, 38, 41] as well as by parkinson disease [1, 37-39]. hypotension is a common side effect of antiparkinsonian drugs such as levodopa. in patients with renal failure, symptomatic postprandial hypotension has been seen during hemodialysis [44, 45]. this appears to be relevant primarily in uremic patients who have autonomic dysfunction. determining the prevalence and clinical implications of postprandial hypotension is complicated not only by different diseases and drugs in the populations studied but also by methodologic inconsistencies among studies. first, the body's position while the meal is being consumed probably affects food-induced changes in blood pressure. postprandial hypotension occurs both in the sitting and supine positions. although the sitting position is more physiologic, orthostatic changes in blood pressure during prolonged sitting might contribute to the postprandial decrease in blood pressure. second, no studies have addressed the variability of postprandial blood pressure. previous studies have shown that orthostatic blood pressure measurements in the elderly vary considerably from day to day [49]. this could also be true for postprandial hypotension. third, the nutrient composition of meals affects the magnitude of the decrease in postprandial blood pressure [12, 13, 15, 50]. carbohydrates and, more specifically, glucose have been found to play a significant role [10, 29]. however, conflicting data have been reported about the influence of fat or protein on postprandial blood pressure [12, 13, 15, 51, 52]. fourth, postprandial hypotension depends on the temperature of the meal [53]. after cold glucose solutions are ingested, blood pressure remains unchanged, whereas glucose solutions served warm or at room temperature cause a decrease in blood pressure. finally, the time at which blood pressure is measured after a meal may influence the detection of this phenomenon. postprandial hypotension can be found at all meal times [14] and is almost immediately apparent after a meal. blood pressure usually reaches a nadir within 30 to 60 minutes. in nursing home residents, the systolic blood pressure nadir occurred as early as 15 minutes after the meal in 13% to 17% of the patients and as late as 75 minutes after the meal in 11% to 13% of the patients [24, 25]. clinical symptoms and significance in elderly persons or patients with autonomic failure, postprandial reductions in blood pressure may result in syncope, falls, angina pectoris, weakness, dizziness, nausea, lightheadedness, or black spots in the visual field [1, 5, 22, 24-26, 29, 39, 46] (table 1). in addition, case reports have described elderly patients with large postprandial reductions in blood pressure who developed angina pectoris or transient ischemic attacks that resolved as blood pressure returned to normal [24, 54]. however, data on the frequency of postprandial hypotension and its potential symptoms are scarce. in one recent study, half of a group of patients with unexplained syncope had postprandial hypotension [27]. table 1. clinical symptoms associated with postprandial hypotension the cerebral symptoms probably depend on the extent to which cerebral perfusion is compromised. accumulation of age- and disease-related conditions that threaten cerebral blood flow or reduce oxygen content in the blood may bring cerebral oxygen delivery near the threshold needed to maintain consciousness [55]. therefore, even small changes in blood pressure may reduce cerebral oxygen delivery to below the critical threshold and thus result in ischemic symptoms. the potential for postprandial cerebral ischemia may be greater in elderly p
irs1 degradation and increased serine phosphorylation cannot predict the degree of metabolic insulin resistance induced by oxidative stress to determine whether defects in the insulin signal transduction cascade are present in skeletal muscle from prediabetic individuals, we excised biopsies from eight glucose-intolerant male first-degree relatives of patients with type 2 diabetes (igt relatives) and nine matched control subjects before and during a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. igt relatives were insulin-resistant in oxidative and nonoxidative pathways for glucose metabolism. in vivo insulin infusion increased skeletal muscle insulin receptor substrate-1 (irs-1) tyrosine phosphorylation (p = 0.01) and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (pi 3-kinase) activity (phosphotyrosine and irs-1 associated) in control subjects (p < 0.02) but not in igt relatives (ns). the incremental increase in insulin action on irs-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was lower in igt relatives versus control subjects (p < 0.05). the incremental defects in signal transduction noted for irs-1 and pi 3-kinase may be attributed to elevated basal phosphorylation/activity of these parameters, because absolute phosphorylation/activity under insulin-stimulated conditions was similar between igt relatives and control subjects. insulin increased akt serine phosphorylation in control subjects and igt relatives, with a tendency for reduced phosphorylation in igt relatives (p = 0.12). in conclusion, aberrant phosphorylation/activity of irs-1, pi 3-kinase, and akt is observed in skeletal muscle from relatives of patients with type 2 diabetes with igt. however, the elevated basal activity of these signaling intermediates and the lack of a strong correlation between these parameters to glucose metabolism suggests that other defects of insulin signal transduction and/or downstream components of glucose metabolism may play a greater role in the development of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle from relatives of patients with type 2 diabetes.
epistatic interaction is an important genetic basis of grain yield and its components in maize design iii is an experimental design originally proposed by r.e. comstock and h.f. robinson for estimating genetic variances and the average degree of dominance for quantitative trait loci (qtl) and has recently been extended for mapping qtl. in this paper, we first extend comstock and robinson's analysis of variance to include linkage, two-locus epistasis and the use of f3 parents. then we develop the theory and statistical analysis of orthogonal contrasts and contrast x environment interaction for a single marker locus to characterize the effects of qtl. the methods are applied to the maize data of c.w. stuber. the analyses strongly suggest that there are multiple linked qtl in many chromosomes for several traits examined. qtl effects are largely environment-independent for grain yield, ear height, plant height and ear leaf area and largely environment dependent for days to tassel, grain moisture and ear number. there is significant qtl epistasis. the results are generally in favor of the hypothesis of dominance of favorable genes to explain the observed heterosis in grain yield and other traits, although epistasis could also play an important role and overdominance at individual qtl level can not be ruled out.
kisspeptin receptor gpr54 promotes adipocyte differentiation and fat accumulation in mice aims/hypothesiswe investigated the production of kisspeptin (kiss1) and the kiss1 receptor, gpr54, in pancreatic islets and determined the effects of exogenous kisspeptin on insulin secretion.methodsrt-pcr and immunohistochemistry were used to detect expression of kiss1 and gpr54 mrnas and the production of kiss1 and gpr54 in human and mouse islets and in beta (min6) and alpha- (alphatc1) cell lines. the effects of kiss1 on basal and glucose-induced insulin secretion from mouse and human islets were measured in a perifusion system.resultskiss1 and gpr54 mrnas were both detected in human and mouse islets, and gpr54 mrna expression was also found in the min6 and alphatc1 endocrine cell lines. in sections of mouse pancreas, kiss1 and gpr54 immunoreactivities were co-localised in both beta and alpha cells within islets, but were not detected in the exocrine pancreas. exposure of mouse and human islets to kiss1 caused a stimulation of glucose-induced (20 mmol/l) insulin secretion, but had no effect on the basal rate of secretion at a sub-stimulatory concentration of glucose (2 mmol/l). in contrast, kiss1 inhibited insulin secretion from min6 cells at both 2 and 20 mmol/l glucose. kiss1 had no significant effect on glucagon secretion from mouse islets.conclusions/interpretationthis is the first report to show that the gpr54/kiss1 system is expressed in the endocrine pancreas, where it influences beta cell secretory function. these observations suggest an important role for this system in the normal regulation of islet function.
wind fields in heterogeneous conifer canopies: parameterisation of momentum absorption using high-resolution 3d vegetation scans abstract a mathematical, computer-based, dynamic sway model of a sitka spruce (picea sitchensis) tree was developed and tested against measurements of the movement of a tree within a forest. the model tree was divided into segments each with a stiffness, mass and damping parameter. equations were formulated to describe the response of every segment which together form a system of coupled differential equations. these were solved with the aid of matrices and from the resulting modes, the transfer function of the tree was found and used to calculate the movement of the tree in the wind. comparison of the modelled movement of a tree in response to the measured wind speed above a forest canopy gave good agreement with the measured movement of the top of the tree but less satisfactory agreement close to the base. the comparison also pointed to the complexity of tree response to the wind and inadequacies in the model. in particular, the branches need to be treated as coupled cantilevers attached to the stem rather than simply as masses lumped together.
drivers of risk perceptions about the invasive non-native plant japanese knotweed in domestic gardens using bioengineering techniques to restore areas invaded by fallopia japonica shows promising results. planting tree cuttings could allow both rapidly re-establishing a competitive native plant community and reducing f. japonica performance. however, f. japonica has been shown to affect native plant species through different mechanisms such as allelopathy. this article investigates the phytotoxic effect of f. japonica on the resprouting capacity and the growth of three salicaceae species with potential value for restoration. an experimental design which physically separates donor pots containing either an individual from f. japonica or bare soil from target pots containing cuttings of populus nigra, salix atrocinerea or salix viminali was used. leachates from donor pots were used to water target pots. the effects of leachates were evaluated by measuring the final biomass of the cuttings. f. japonica leachates inhibited the growth of cuttings, and this effect is linked to the emission of polyphenol compounds by f. japonica. leachates also induced changes in soil nitrogen composition. these results suggest the existence of allelopathic effects, direct and/or indirect, of f. japonica on the growth of salicaceae species cuttings. however, the three species were not equally affected, suggesting that the choice of resistant species could be crucial for restoration success.
phylogeography, historical demography, and genetic structure of the rose bitterling, rhodeus ocellatus (kner, 1866) (cypriniformes: acheilognathidae), in east asia. [1] a new regional compilation of the drainage history in southeastern tibet suggests that the modern rivers draining the plateau margin were once tributaries to a single, southward flowing system which drained into the south china sea. disruption of the paleo-drainage occurred by river capture and reversal prior to or coeval with the initiation of miocene (?) uplift in eastern tibet, including ∼2000 m of surface uplift of the lower plateau margin since reversal of the flow direction of the yangtze river. despite lateral changes in course due to capture and reversal, the superposition of eastward and southward draining rivers that cross the southeastern plateau margin suggests that uplift has occurred over long wavelengths (>1000 km), mimicking the present low-gradient topographic slope. thus reorganization of drainage lines by capture and reversal events explains most of the peculiar patterns of the eastern plateau rivers, without having to appeal to large-magnitude tectonic shear.
recovering missing labels of crowdsourcing workers we consider the general problem of learning from labeled and unlabeled data, which is often called semi-supervised learning or transductive inference. a principled approach to semi-supervised learning is to design a classifying function which is sufficiently smooth with respect to the intrinsic structure collectively revealed by known labeled and unlabeled points. we present a simple algorithm to obtain such a smooth solution. our method yields encouraging experimental results on a number of classification problems and demonstrates effective use of unlabeled data.
equipment-as-experience: a heidegger-based position of information security while there is a rich body of literature on user acceptance of technologies with positive outcomes, little is known about user behavior toward what we call protective technologies: information technologies that protect data and systems from disturbances such as viruses, unauthorized access, disruptions, spyware, and others. in this paper, we present the results of a study of user behavioral intention toward protective technologies based on the framework of the theory of planned behavior. we find that awareness of the threats posed by negative technologies is a strong predictor of user behavioral intention toward the use of protective technologies. more interestingly, in the presence of awareness, the influence of subjective norm on individual behavioral intention is weaker among basic technology users but stronger among advanced technology users. furthermore, while our results are consistent with many of the previously established relationships in the context of positive technologies, we find that the determinants “perceived ease of use” and “computer self-efficacy” are no longer significant in the context of protective technologies. we believe that this result highlights the most significant difference between positive technologies and protective technologies: while the former are used for their designed utilities, for which usefulness and ease of use have a significant impact, the latter are used out of fear of negative consequences, for which awareness becomes a key determinant. we discussed the theoretical and practical implications of these findings. the findings of this study extend the theory of planned behavior to the context of protective technologies and shed insights on designing effective information security policies, practices, and protective technologies for organizations and society.
the influence of regional health system characteristics on the surgical management and receipt of post operative radiation therapy for glioblastoma multiforme purpose to evaluate trends in the geographic distribution of the radiation oncology (ro) workforce.   methods and materials we used the 1995 and 2007 versions of the area resource file to map the ratio of ro to the population aged 65 years or older (ror) within different health service areas (hsa) within the united states. we used regression analysis to find associations between population variables and 2007 ror. we calculated gini coefficients for ror to assess the evenness of ro distribution and compared that with primary care physicians and total physicians.   results there was a 24% increase in the ro workforce from 1995 to 2007. the overall growth in the ro workforce was less than that of primary care or the overall physician workforce. the mean ror among hsas increased by more than one radiation oncologist per 100,000 people aged 65 years or older, from 5.08 per 100,000 to 6.16 per 100,000. however, there remained consistent geographic variability concerning ro distribution, specifically affecting the non-metropolitan hsas. regression analysis found higher ror in hsas that possessed higher education (p = 0.001), higher income (p < 0.001), lower unemployment rates (p < 0.001), and higher minority population (p = 0.022). gini coefficients showed ro distribution less even than for both primary care physicians and total physicians (0.326 compared with 0.196 and 0.292, respectively).   conclusions despite a modest growth in the ro workforce, there exists persistent geographic maldistribution of radiation oncologists allocated along socioeconomic and racial lines. to solve problems surrounding the ro workforce, issues concerning both gross numbers and geographic distribution must be addressed.
sequence and expression analysis of the arabidopsis iqm family as part of a study of the diversity of myosins, we have cloned a cdna encoding a myosin-like protein from arabidopsis thaliana. this is the first molecular motor of any kind to be cloned from a higher plant. the predicted polypeptide (molecular weight 131 kda) has a motor domain (head) very similar to those of other myosins, but the remainder of the sequence is unusual. the tail contains four potential calmodulin binding sites ("iq-motifs"), but no sequence motifs suggestive of actin or phospholipid binding, like those found in other myosins. there is also a small region of probable alpha-helical coiled-coil, which suggests that the molecule could be dimeric, though unlikely to form filaments. the n-terminal and c-terminal regions of the molecule are unique. we present a phylogenetic analysis of myosin head sequences, which suggests that this is a new type of myosin.
purification and characterization of a serine alkaline protease from bacillus clausii gmbae 42 an extracellular alkaline serine protease (called dhap), produced by a bacillus pumilus strain, demonstrates significant dehairing function. this protease is purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography, ion exchange, and gel filtration. dhap had a pi of 9.0 and a molecular weight of approximately 32,000 dalton. it shows maximal activity at ph 10 and with a temperature of 55°c; the enzyme activity can be completely inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pmsf) and diisopropyl fluorophosphates (dfp). the first 20 amino acid residues of the purified dhap have been determined with a sequence of aqtvpygipqikapavhaqg. alignment of this sequence with other alkaline protease demonstrates its high homology with protease from another b. pumilus strain.
key-recovery attacks on universal hash function based mac algorithms we describe a message authentication algorithm, umac, which can authenticate messages (in software, on contemporary machines) roughly an order of magnitude faster than current practice (e.g., hmac-sha1), and about twice as fast as times previously reported for the universal hash-function family mmh. to achieve such speeds, umac uses a new universal hash-function family, nh, and a design which allows effective exploitation of simd parallelism. the "cryptographic" work of umac is done using standard primitives of the user's choice, such as a block cipher or cryptographic hash function; no new heuristic primitives are developed here. instead, the security of umac is rigorously proven, in the sense of giving exact and quantitatively strong results which demonstrate an inability to forge umac-authenticated messages assuming an inability to break the underlying cryptographic primitive. unlike conventional, inherently serial macs, umac is parallelizable, and will have ever-faster implementation speeds as machines offer up increasing amounts of parallelism. we envision umac as a practical algorithm for next-generation message authentication.
will remote sensing shape the next generation of species distribution models one of the key advantages of a low-flying unmanned aircraft system uas is its ability to acquire digital images at an ultrahigh spatial resolution of a few centimeters. remote sensing of quantitative biochemical and biophysical characteristics of small-sized spatially fragmented vegetation canopies requires, however, not only high spatial, but also high spectral i.e., hyperspectral resolution. in this paper, we describe the design, development, airborne operations, calibration, processing, and interpretation of image data collected with a new hyperspectral unmanned aircraft system hyperuas. hyperuas is a remotely controlled multirotor prototype carrying onboard a lightweight pushbroom spectroradiometer coupled with a dual frequency gps and an inertial movement unit. the prototype was built to remotely acquire imaging spectroscopy data of 324 spectral bands 162 bands in a spectrally binned mode with bandwidths between 4 and 5i¾?nm at an ultrahigh spatial resolution of 2-5i¾?cm. three field airborne experiments, conducted over agricultural crops and over natural ecosystems of antarctic mosses, proved operability of the system in standard field conditions, but also in a remote and harsh, low-temperature environment of east antarctica. experimental results demonstrate that hyperuas is capable of delivering georeferenced maps of quantitative biochemical and biophysical variables of vegetation and of actual vegetation health state at an unprecedented spatial resolution of 5i¾?cm.
impact of planting container type on growth and survival of three hybrid poplar clones in central alberta, canada eddy covariance was used to measure above-canopy exchanges of co2 and water vapor at an operational plantation of hybrid poplar (variety “walker”) established on marginal agricultural land in east central alberta, canada. winter ecosystem respiration (re) rates were inferred from seasonal changes in the normalized respiration rate at 10°c (r10) for the growing season and observations of soil co2 concentration measured with solid-state probes. over five consecutive growing seasons following planting, gross ecosystem production (gep) increased each year, ranging from 21 g c m−2 y−1 in year 1 to 469 g c m−2 y−1 in year 5. during this period, the annual carbon balance shifted from a net source of greater than 330 g c m−2 in year 1 to approximately c-neutral in year 5. total carbon (c) release over 5 years likely exceeded 630 g c m−2. intra- and interannual variations in temperature and soil water availability greatly affected annual c balance each year. gep and re were particularly sensitive to temperature during spring and to soil water availability in summer: year 5 was notable because a cold spring and accumulating drought caused growth and carbon uptake to fall well below their potential. annual evapotranspiration (et) increased slightly with leaf area, from 281 mm in year 1 to 323 mm in year 4, but in year 5 it declined, while exceeding total precipitation (p). this trend of increasing annual et/p suggests that annual gep could become increasingly water-limited in years with below normal precipitation, as the plantation achieves maximum leaf area. measured canopy albedos did not change appreciably over three winters, suggesting that estimates of increased radiative forcing resulting from afforestation in high latitudes could be exaggerated in regions where fast-growing deciduous plantations are managed on short (~20-year) rotations.
what we learned from the dust bowl: lessons in science, policy, and adaptation abstract coupled global circulation models (cgcms) have been widely used to explore potential future climate change. before these climate projections can be trusted, the ability of the models to simulate present-day climate must be assessed. this study evaluates the ability of three cgcms that participated in the fourth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change to simulate long-term drought over the great plains region with the same frequency and intensity as was observed during the twentieth century. the three models evaluated in this study are the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory coupled model, version 2.0 (cm2.0); the national centers for atmospheric research community climate system model, version 3 (ccsm3); and third climate configuration of the met office unified model (hadcm3). the models are shown to capture the broad features of the climatology of the great plains, with maximum precipitation occurring in early summer, as observed. however, all of the models overestim...
a novel antitumor activity of deguelin targeting the insulin-like growth factor (igf) receptor pathway via up-regulation of igf-binding protein-3 expression in breast cancer. activation of survival pathways has been associated with chemoresistance and progression of androgen independence which places a major obstacle to successful treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. deguelin, a rotenoid isolated from mundulea sericea, has an anticancer effect against several types of cancers; however, the mechanism of its antitumor effects on prostate cancer is not well understood. the aim of our study was to elucidate the effect of deguelin on the growth of prostate cancer cells and its putative mechanism of action. deguelin decreased the viability of both androgen‐dependent and ‐independent prostate cancer cells but not normal prostate epithelial cells. downregulation of phosphorylated akt and gsk‐3β by deguelin promoted proteosomal degradation of β‐catenin that resulted in decreased nuclear accumulation and inhibited transactivation of β‐catenin‐responsive genes. deguelin‐induced downregulation of proliferative (cyclin d1 and c‐myc) and antiapoptotic proteins (mcl‐1, bcl‐xl and survivin) in prostate cancer cells culminated in the induction of apoptosis, inhibition of dna synthesis and cell growth, altered membrane integrity, marked reduction of invasiveness, inhibition of anchorage‐dependent and ‐independent colony formation. our data demonstrated for the first time that deguelin inhibits the growth and survival of human androgen‐independent prostate cancer cells, and its anticancer and antimetastatic activity occurs, at least in part through downregulating gsk‐3β/β‐catenin signaling pathway and antiapoptotic survival proteins. taken together our study indicates that deguelin may have translational potential as therapeutic agent for advanced or metastatic prostate cancer.
functional and structural characteristics of secretory iga antibodies elicited by mucosal vaccines against influenza virus. the roles of igg and secretory iga in the protection of the respiratory tract (rt) against influenza infection remain unclear. passive immunization with ab doses resulting in serum igg anti-influenza virus ab titers far in excess of those observed in immune mice has compounded the problem. we compared the effects of i.v. anti-influenza virus igg and i.v. anti-influenza virus polymeric iga (piga) mab administered in amounts designed to replicate murine convalescent serum or nasal ab titers, respectively. a serum anti-influenza virus igg titer 2.5 times the normal convalescent serum anti-influenza virus igg titer was required for detectible ab transudation into nasal secretions, and a serum igg titer 7 times normal was needed to lower nasal viral shedding by 98%. anti-influenza virus piga at a nasal ab titer comparable to that seen in convalescent mice eliminated nasal viral shedding. the rt of influenza-infected piga- or igg-protected mice were studied by scanning electron microscopy. only piga was found to prevent virally induced pathology in the upper rt, suggesting that igg did not prevent viral infection of the nose, but neutralized newly replicated virus after infection had been initiated. in contrast, igg, but not piga, was found to prevent viral pathology in the murine lung. our results help to resolve the controversy of iga- vs igg-mediated protection of the rt; both abs are important, with plasma igg ab serving as the back-up for secretory iga-mediated protection in the nasal compartment, and igg being the dominant ab in protection of the lung.
ultrasonographic and magnetic resonance imaging diagnosis of an oropharyngeal wood penetrating injury in a dog. objective the purpose of this study was to identify the characteristic imaging features of wooden foreign bodies.   materials and methods the imaging studies of 12 patients with surgically confirmed wooden foreign bodies were retrospectively reviewed. the study group consisted of seven females and five males, 10-65 years old (mean age, 36 years). all patients underwent radiography. nine patients were evaluated with sonography, eight with mr imaging, three with ct, and one with ct arthrography. gadolinium-enhanced mr imaging was performed in six patients. three patients presented with a draining sinus and nine with painful swelling. only three patients presented with a history of penetrating injury.   results lesions were located in the foot (n = 4), hand (n = 3), thigh (n = 2), calf (n = 2), and elbow (n = 1). radiographs failed to reveal the retained foreign bodies in all patients. with mr imaging, wooden foreign bodies displayed a variable signal intensity that was equal to or less than that of skeletal muscle on both t1- and t2-weighted images. mr imaging showed the surrounding inflammatory response in all patients. ct showed the retained wood as linear cylindric foci of increased attenuation. wood was highly echogenic and revealed pronounced acoustic shadowing on sonography. arthrography in one patient showed an associated reactive synovitis.   conclusion the imaging appearance of wooden foreign bodies is variable; however, imaging can be quite specific, and when taken in the appropriate clinical setting, the imaging should reliably suggest the diagnosis. sonography is frequently underused but proved most useful for the evaluation of retained wooden foreign bodies.
systematic screening reveals a role for brca1 in the response to transcription-associated dna damage. cullin 4 (cul4)‐based ubiquitin ligases emerged as critical regulators of dna replication and repair. over 50 cul4‐specific adaptors (dna damage‐binding 1 (ddb1)–cul4‐associated factors; dcafs) have been identified and are thought to assemble functionally distinct cul4 complexes. using a live‐cell imaging‐based rnai screen, we analysed the function of dcafs and cul4‐linked proteins, and identified specific subsets required for progression through g1 and s phase. we discovered c6orf167/mms22‐like protein (mms22l) as a putative human orthologue of budding yeast mms22, which, together with cullin rtt101, regulates genome stability by promoting dna replication through natural pause sites and damaged templates. loss of mms22l function in human cells results in s phase‐dependent genomic instability characterised by spontaneous double‐strand breaks and dna damage checkpoint activation. unlike yeast mms22, human mms22l does not stably bind to cul4, but is degraded in a cul4‐dependent manner and upon replication stress. mms22l physically and functionally interacts with the scaffold‐like protein nfkbil2 that co‐purifies with histones, several chromatin remodelling and dna replication/repair factors. together, our results strongly suggest that the mms22l–nfkbil2 complex contributes to genome stability by regulating the chromatin state at stalled replication forks.
functional characterization of two alternatively spliced transcripts of tomato abscisic acid insensitive3 (abi3) gene the arabidopsisgene abi3 shows developmentally regulated alternative splicing. abi3-α and abi3-β splice variants encode full-length and truncated abi3 proteins, respectively. the conserved splicing factor sua reduces splicing of a cryptic abi3 intron, which leads to the accumulation of abi3-α. mutations in sua suppress the frameshift mutant abi3-5 by restoring its reading frame. abscisic acid insensitive3 (abi3) is a major regulator of seed maturation in arabidopsis thaliana. we detected two abi3 transcripts, abi3-α and abi3-β, which encode full-length and truncated proteins, respectively. alternative splicing of abi3 is developmentally regulated, and the abi3-β transcript accumulates at the end of seed maturation. the two abi3 transcripts differ by the presence of a cryptic intron in abi3-α, which is spliced out in abi3-β. the suppressor of abi3-5 (sua) mutant consistently restores wild-type seed features in the frameshift mutant abi3-5 but does not suppress other abi3 mutant alleles. sua is a conserved splicing factor, homologous to the human protein rbm5, and reduces splicing of the cryptic abi3 intron, leading to a decrease in abi3-β transcript. in the abi3-5 mutant, abi3-β codes for a functional abi3 protein due to frameshift restoration.
elastin in oral connective tissue modulates the keratinization of overlying epithelium. hyper- and hypovitaminosis a both provoke epithelial pathologies in animals and humans. this suggests that a critical level of retinoic acid (ra) is required in vivo for the maintenance of normal architecture and function of these tissues. however, no beneficial, but only adverse effects of ra on epithelia have been so far observed in vitro. for instance, addition of ra to keratinocyte cultures has been shown to inhibit epidermal differentiation while this process is stimulated by serum delipidization, which reduces ra concentration in the medium. assuming that the previous failure to demonstrate beneficial effects of ra on the epidermal phenotype in vitro was due to culture conditions too far from the in vivo conditions we decided to reevaluate the effect of ra in a culture system optimized for epidermal morphogenesis: the "emerged dermal equivalent." when human keratinocytes were grown in such a system with total fetal calf serum, the resulting epithelium was very similar to normal epidermis. but when delipidized serum was used, the epithelium was abnormal in the direction of excessive maturation (hyperkeratosis). when physiological concentrations of ra (10(-9) and 10(-8) m) were added to the delipidized serum supplement, a normal architecture (orthokeratosis) was restored. however, as classically described in the literature, higher ra concentrations (greater than 10(-7) m) reduced epidermal maturation and produced parakeratosis. thus, although it is unquestionable that ra reduces the synthesis of epidermal-specific differentiation markers, an optimal epidermal morphogenesis seems to be achieved only in the presence of a critical ra concentration.
long-term effects of cannabis on eye movement control in reading abstract cannabis is known to affect human cognitive and visuomotor skills directly after consumption. some studies even point to rather long-lasting effects, especially after chronic tetrahydrocannabinol (thc) abuse. however, it is still unknown whether long-term effects on basic visual and oculomotor processing may exist. in the present study, the performance of 20 healthy long-term cannabis users without acute thc intoxication and 20 control subjects were examined in four basic visuomotor paradigms to search for specific long-term impairments. subjects were asked to perform: 1) reflexive saccades to visual targets (prosaccades), including gap and overlap conditions, 2) voluntary antisaccades, 3) memory-guided saccades and 4) double-step saccades. spatial and temporal parameters of the saccades were subsequently analysed. thc subjects exhibited a significant increase of latency in the prosaccade and antisaccade tasks, as well as prolonged saccade amplitudes in the antisaccade and memory-guided task, compared with the control subjects. the results point to substantial and specific long-term deficits in basic temporal processing of saccades and impaired visuo-spatial working memory. we suggest that these impairments are a major contributor to degraded performance of chronic users in a vital everyday task like visual search, and they might potentially also affect spatial navigation and reading.
inactivation of ventral midline thalamus produces selective spatial delayed conditional discrimination impairment in the rat in spite of the acknowledged role that the thalamus plays in declarative memory, details about the precise memory processes it is involved in and which are the structures of the thalamus that contribute to these processes remain unknown. an overview is presented of human clinical and animal experimental findings showing the involvement of the thalamus, at the level of white matter tracts and separate nuclei, in aspects of memory functioning. the region in the thalamus that contributes to declarative memory is the anterior and medial division, containing the anterior nuclei, the medial dorsal nucleus and the intralaminar and midline nuclei. a lesion to the anterior nuclei or their afferent white matter tract, the mammillothalamic tract, results in deficits of encoding of new stimuli. lesions to the medial dorsal nucleus affect executive processes pertaining to declarative memory, such as the use of memory strategies for retrieval; damage to the intralaminar and midline nuclei results in decreased arousal and thus affects the declarative memory process. based on anatomical and functional data, a theory is proposed of how the thalamus might play a role at different levels of declarative memory functioning. firstly, the anterior and mediodorsal nucleus are involved in processing the contents of the stimuli for storage and recall. the anterior nuclei influence the selection of material to be stored and remembered, whereas the mediodorsal nucleus is involved in the coordination and selection of the strategies used to retrieve material. secondly, the intralaminar and midline nuclei and specifically the lateral and ventral components, maintain a necessary state of the cortical regions involved in the ongoing memory processes. the two types of function subserved by these groups of thalamic nuclei, focussing on contents vs. state, need to work in parallel to mediate and allow memory functioning, respectively.
economic inequality is related to cross-national prevalence of psychotic symptoms greater income inequality is associated with higher prevalence of mental illness and drug misuse in rich societies. there are threefold differences in the proportion of the population suffering from mental illness between more and less equal countries. this relationship is most likely mediated by the impact of inequality on the quality of social relationships and the scale of status differentiation in different societies.
rapid development of adaptive, climate-driven clinal variation in seed mass in the invasive annual forb echium plantagineum l. biological invasions may expose populations to strong selection for local adaptation along geographical gradients in climate. however, evolution during contemporary timescales can be constrained by low standing genetic variation and genetic correlations among life-history traits. we examined limits to local adaptation associated with northern migration of the invasive wetland plant purple loosestrife (lythrum salicaria) using a selection model incorporating a trade-off between flowering time and size at reproduction, and common garden experiments of populations sampled along a latitudinal transect of approximately 1200 km in eastern north america. a strong trade-off between flowering time and size at reproduction caused early-flowering plants to be smaller with reduced seed production in northern populations. northward spread was associated with a decline in genetic variance within populations and an increase in genetic skew for flowering time and size, with limited genetic variation for small, early-flowering genotypes. these patterns were predicted by our selection model of local adaptation to shorter growing seasons and were not consistent with expectations from non-adaptive processes. reduced fecundity may limit population growth and rates of spread in northern populations. identifying genetic constraints on key life-history traits can provide novel insights into invasion dynamics and the causes of range limits in introduced species.
artificial reefs for sea cucumber aquaculture confirmed as settlement substrates of the moon jellyfish aurelia coerulea jellyfish (cnidaria, scyphozoa) blooms appear to be increasing in both intensity and frequency in many coastal areas worldwide, due to multiple hypothesized anthropogenic stressors. here, we propose that the proliferation of artificial structures – associated with (1) the exponential growth in shipping, aquaculture, and other coastal industries, and (2) coastal protection (collectively, “ocean sprawl”) – provides habitat for jellyfish polyps and may be an important driver of the global increase in jellyfish blooms. however, the habitat of the benthic polyps that commonly result in coastal jellyfish blooms has remained elusive, limiting our understanding of the drivers of these blooms. support for the hypothesized role of ocean sprawl in promoting jellyfish blooms is provided by observations and experimental evidence demonstrating that jellyfish larvae settle in large numbers on artificial structures in coastal waters and develop into dense concentrations of jellyfish-producing polyps.
an amish founder mutation disrupts a pi(3)p-whamm-arp2/3 complex–driven autophagosomal remodeling pathway a fundamental question regarding autophagosome formation is how the shape of the double-membrane autophagosomal vesicle is generated. here we show that in mammalian cells assembly of an actin scaffold inside the isolation membrane (the autophagosomal precursor) is essential for autophagosomal membrane shaping. actin filaments are depolymerized shortly after starvation and actin is assembled into a network within the isolation membrane. when formation of actin puncta is disrupted by an actin polymerization inhibitor or by knocking down the actin-capping protein capzβ, isolation membranes and omegasomes collapse into mixed-membrane bundles. formation of actin puncta is ptdins(3)p dependent, and inhibition of ptdins(3)p formation by treating cells with the pi(3)k inhibitor 3-ma, or by knocking down beclin-1, abolishes the formation of actin puncta. binding of capz to ptdins(3)p, which is enriched in omegasomes, stimulates actin polymerization. our findings illuminate the mechanism underlying autophagosomal membrane shaping and provide key insights into how autophagosomes are formed.
germline genetic markers for urinary bladder cancer risk, prognosis and treatment response. purpose the present study sought to identify pretreatment prognostic factors for overall survival (os) in patients with metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract (tccu) who experienced treatment failure with the first-line, platinum-based regimen included in the phase iii vinflunine trial. patients and methods in total, 370 patients with platinum-refractory tccu were included in this analysis. potential prognostic factors were recorded prospectively. univariate analysis was used to identify clinical and laboratory factors that significantly impact survival. multivariate analysis was used to identify independent prognostic factors, and bootstrap analysis was performed for internal validation, forming a prognostic model. external validation was performed on the phase ii vinflunine study ca183001. results multivariate analysis and the internal validation identified eastern cooperative oncology group performance status (ps) more than 0, hemoglobin level less than 10 g/dl, and the presence of liver metastasis as the main adverse prognostic factors for os. external validation confirmed these prognostic factors. four subgroups were formed based on the presence of zero, one, two, or three prognostic factors; the median os times for these groups were 14.2, 7.3, 3.8, and 1.7 months (p < .001), respectively. conclusion we identified and both internally and externally validated three adverse risk factors (ps, hemoglobin level, and liver metastasis) that predict for os and developed a scoring system that classifies patients with platinum-refractory disease on second-line chemotherapy into four risk groups with different outcome. similar to the first-line setting, the presence of visceral metastases and poor ps predict a worse prognosis. these factors, together with low hemoglobin, can be used for prognostication and future patient stratification in clinical trials.
treatment with 1,25(oh)2d3induced hdac2 expression and reduced nf-κb p65 expression in a rat model of ova-induced asthma corticosteroids are the most effective therapy for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as asthma. functionally, they act partly by inducing anti-inflammatory genes such as secretary leukocyte proteinase inhibitor, lipocortin-1 and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, but mainly by repression of inflammatory genes, such as cytokines, adhesion molecules, inflammatory enzymes and receptors. they act by binding to a cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor (gr), which upon binding is activated and rapidly translocates to the nucleus. within the nucleus, the gr either induces gene transcription by binding to specific deoxyribonucleic acid elements in the promoter/enhancer regions of responsive genes or reduces gene transcription by transrepression. the gr reduces gene transcription by interaction with pro-inflammatory transcription factors such as activation protein-1 and nuclear factor-kappa b. these effects of the gr on gene expression involve changes in the chromatin structure localized to the promoter sites of responsive genes. many of the detrimental side-effects of corticosteroids are believed to be due to gene induction, leading to the search for novel corticosteroids which can repress inflammatory genes without inducing gene transcription.
the effects of tio2 nanodot films with rgd immobilization on light-induced cell sheet technology the phenomenon of light-induced cell detachment is reported. mouse calvaria-derived, pre-osteoblastic (mc3t3-e1) cells were cultured on a tio(2) nanodot-coated quartz substrate. after 20 min of uv365 illumination, over 90% of the cells would detach from the surface. moreover, intact cell sheets could be obtained in the same way. it was found that the as-obtained cells showed good viability, and could be used for further culture processes and other applications. also, biocompatibility and safety characterizations indicated that the use of tio(2) nanodots and uv365 illumination was safe for such cell detachment. it is suggested that adsorbed extracellular matrix proteins play key roles in developing cell sheets and ensuring biocompatibility. the present light-induced cell detachment method demonstrates a promising way for rapid cell/cell sheet harvesting.
pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine responses to a 164-km road cycle ride in a hot environment elevated antigen-stimulated anti-inflammatory cytokine production appears to be a risk factor for upper respiratory tract illness in athletes. the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of prolonged exercise and hydration on antigen-stimulated cytokine production. twelve healthy males cycled for 120 min at 60% v˙o2max⁡ on two occasions, either euhydrated or moderately hypohydrated (induced by fluid restriction for 24 h). blood samples were collected before and after exercise and following 2 h recovery for determination of cell counts, plasma cortisol, and in vitro antigen-stimulated cytokine production by whole blood culture. fluid restriction resulted in mean body mass loss of 1.3% and 3.9% before and after exercise, respectively. exercise elicited a significant leukocytosis and elevated plasma cortisol, with no differences between trials. il-6 production was significantly reduced 2 h postexercise (p < 0.05), while il-10 production was elevated postexercise (p < 0.05). ifn-γ and il-2 production tended to decrease postexercise. no significant effect of hydration status was observed for the measured variables. prolonged exercise appears to result in augmented anti-inflammatory cytokine release in response to antigen challenge, possibly coupled with acute suppression of proinflammatory cytokine production, corresponding with studies using mitogen or endotoxin as stimulant. moderate hypohydration does not appear to influence these changes.
anomalous glutamate/alkali cation symport in larval manduca sexta midgut. uptake of tritiated leucine, alanine, and phenylalanine was measured at the physiological ph of 10 by rapid filtration in brush-border membrane vesicles from the midgut of the larval tobacco hornworm, manduca sexta. a 20-fold excess of unlabeled leucine, isoleucine, methionine, valine, alanine, lysine, histidine, phenylalanine, and glutamine inhibited uptake of leucine and phenylalanine, and six of these amino acids inhibited uptake of alanine, by more than 50% both in the presence and absence of a potassium ion gradient. these inhibitory amino acids also drove countertransport of leucine, alanine, and phenylalanine with accumulation ratios exceeding 2. these results are consistent with the hypothesis that leucine, alanine, and phenylalanine share a common uptake system - a broad scope b type symporter - which interacts strongly with half of the commonly occurring amino acids, interacts moderately with an additional quarter of them, but does not interact with cysteine, arginine, glutamate, aspartate, or proline.
towards a framework of digital platform competition: a comparative study of monopolistic & federated mobile payment platforms i this essay, we argue that pervasive digitization gives birth to a new type of product architecture: the layered modular architecture. the layered modular architecture extends the modular architecture of physical products by incorporating four loosely coupled layers of devices, networks, services, and contents created by digital technology. we posit that this new architecture instigates profound changes in the ways that firms organize for innovation in the future. we develop (1) a conceptual framework to describe the emerging organizing logic of digital innovation and (2) an information systems research agenda for digital strategy and the creation and management of corporate information technology infrastructures.
effect of admission time on mortality in an intensive care unit in mainland china: a propensity score matching analysis objectiveto examine the influence of time of admission on risk-adjusted mortality and length of stay for nonelective patients admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit (icu) without 24-h per day in-house intensivist coverage.designdata analyzed came from a comprehensive, prospectively collected icu database.settinga 12-bed pediatric icu located in a university-affiliated tertiary referral children's hospital.patientssubjects consisted of 4,456 consecutive nonelective patients admitted over a 10-year period (1997–2006).interventionsnone.measurements and resultspatients were categorized according to time of admission to the icu as either in-hours (0800–1800 monday–friday and 0800–1200 on weekends), when an intensivist is present in the icu, or after-hours (all other times), when intensivists attend only on an as-needed basis. multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the effect of time of admission on outcome after adjustment for severity of illness using the paediatric index of mortality (pim). patients admitted after hours had a lower risk-adjusted mortality than those admitted during normal working hours, with an odds ratio for death of 0.712 (95% confidence interval 0.518–0.980, p = 0.037). length of stay was also significantly shorter for patients admitted after hours (44.05 h vs. 50.0 h, p = 0.001).conclusionsa lack of in-house intensivist presence is not associated with any increase in mortality or length of stay for patients admitted to our pediatric icu; on the contrary, after-hours admission in this cohort was associated with a decreased risk-adjusted mortality and a shorter length of stay.
the ascorbic acid transporter svct2 is expressed in slow-twitch skeletal muscle fibres reactive oxygen species (ros) and redox state have emerged as physiological mediators, controlling blood coagulation and thrombosis. the redox balance is obviously linked to the presence of antioxidants; in particular, vitamin c appears to be a key modulator of platelet oxidative state, since these cells physiologically accumulate ascorbic acid and, moreover, platelet ascorbate plays a role during aggregation. here, we showed that platelets could compensate for fluctuations in ascorbate levels by modulating the expression of the na+-dependent transporter svct2. furthermore, the use of anucleated cells demonstrated, for the first time, that svct2 expression could be regulated at the translational level. the control of ascorbic acid uptake, through regulation of its carrier, was not only related to substrate availability, but it also occurred during platelet activation, which was accompanied by vitamin c deprivation and alteration in the redox state. finally, we showed that changes in intracellular ascorbic acid content had physiological relevance, since they modulate the surface sulfhydryl content and the thrombus viscoelastic properties. beside its role during aggregation, vitamin c may also have important effects during postaggregatory events.
ion channel clustering enhances weak electric field detection by neutrophils: apparent roles of skf96365-sensitive cation channels and myeloperoxidase trafficking in cellular responses application of extremely low frequency pulsed dc electric fields that are frequency- and phase-matched with endogenous metabolic oscillations leads to greatly exaggerated neutrophil extension and metabolic resonance wherein oscillatory nad(p)h amplitudes are increased. in the presence of a resonant field, migrating cell length grows from 10 to approximately 40 microm, as does the overall length of microfilament assemblies. in contrast, cells stop locomotion and become spherical when exposed to phase-mismatched fields. although cellular effects were not found to be dependent on electrode type and buffer, they were sensitive to temporal constraints (phase and pulse length) and cell surface charge. we suggest an electromechanical coupling hypothesis wherein applied electric fields and cytoskeletal polymerization forces act together to overcome the surface/cortical tension of neutrophils, thus promoting net cytoskeletal assembly and heightened metabolic amplitudes. metabolic resonance enhances reactive oxygen metabolic production by neutrophils. furthermore, cellular dna damage was observed after prolonged metabolic resonance using both single cell gel electrophoresis ('comet' assay) and 3'-oh dna labeling using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. these results provide insights into transmembrane signal processing and cell interactions with weak electric fields.
the development and validation of a fast and robust dried blood spot based lipid profiling method to study infant metabolism dyslipidemia is an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes, although exactly which of the many plasma lipids contribute to this remains unclear. we therefore investigated whether lipid profiling can inform diabetes prediction by performing liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-based lipid profiling in 189 individuals who developed type 2 diabetes and 189 matched disease-free individuals, with over 12 years of follow up in the framingham heart study. we found that lipids of lower carbon number and double bond content were associated with an increased risk of diabetes, whereas lipids of higher carbon number and double bond content were associated with decreased risk. this pattern was strongest for triacylglycerols (tags) and persisted after multivariable adjustment for age, sex, bmi, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, total triglycerides, and hdl cholesterol. a combination of 2 tags further improved diabetes prediction. to explore potential mechanisms that modulate the distribution of plasma lipids, we performed lipid profiling during oral glucose tolerance testing, pharmacologic interventions, and acute exercise testing. levels of tags associated with increased risk for diabetes decreased in response to insulin action and were elevated in the setting of insulin resistance. conversely, levels of tags associated with decreased diabetes risk rose in response to insulin and were poorly correlated with insulin resistance. these studies identify a relationship between lipid acyl chain content and diabetes risk and demonstrate how lipid profiling could aid in clinical risk assessment.
enhancing masculinity by slandering homosexuals two experiments tested whether the relation between automatic prejudice and discriminatory behavior is moderated by 2 conscious processes: conscious egalitarian beliefs and behavioral control. the authors predicted that, when both conscious processes are deactivated, automatic prejudice would elicit discriminatory behavior. when either of the 2 processes is activated, behavioral bias would be eliminated. the authors assessed participants' automatic attitudes toward gay men, conscious beliefs about gender, behavioral control, and interactions with gay confederates. in experiment 1, men's beliefs about gender were heterogeneous, whereas women's beliefs were mostly egalitarian; men's responses supported the predictions, but women's responses did not. in experiment 2, the authors recruited a sample with greater diversity in gender-related beliefs. results showed that, for both sexes, automatic prejudice produced biased behavior in the absence of conscious egalitarian beliefs and behavioral control. the presence of either conscious process eliminated behavioral bias.
functional characterization of two alternatively spliced transcripts of tomato abscisic acid insensitive3 (abi3) gene the arabidopsisgene abi3 shows developmentally regulated alternative splicing. abi3-α and abi3-β splice variants encode full-length and truncated abi3 proteins, respectively. the conserved splicing factor sua reduces splicing of a cryptic abi3 intron, which leads to the accumulation of abi3-α. mutations in sua suppress the frameshift mutant abi3-5 by restoring its reading frame. abscisic acid insensitive3 (abi3) is a major regulator of seed maturation in arabidopsis thaliana. we detected two abi3 transcripts, abi3-α and abi3-β, which encode full-length and truncated proteins, respectively. alternative splicing of abi3 is developmentally regulated, and the abi3-β transcript accumulates at the end of seed maturation. the two abi3 transcripts differ by the presence of a cryptic intron in abi3-α, which is spliced out in abi3-β. the suppressor of abi3-5 (sua) mutant consistently restores wild-type seed features in the frameshift mutant abi3-5 but does not suppress other abi3 mutant alleles. sua is a conserved splicing factor, homologous to the human protein rbm5, and reduces splicing of the cryptic abi3 intron, leading to a decrease in abi3-β transcript. in the abi3-5 mutant, abi3-β codes for a functional abi3 protein due to frameshift restoration.
impact of planting container type on growth and survival of three hybrid poplar clones in central alberta, canada eddy covariance was used to measure above-canopy exchanges of co2 and water vapor at an operational plantation of hybrid poplar (variety “walker”) established on marginal agricultural land in east central alberta, canada. winter ecosystem respiration (re) rates were inferred from seasonal changes in the normalized respiration rate at 10°c (r10) for the growing season and observations of soil co2 concentration measured with solid-state probes. over five consecutive growing seasons following planting, gross ecosystem production (gep) increased each year, ranging from 21 g c m−2 y−1 in year 1 to 469 g c m−2 y−1 in year 5. during this period, the annual carbon balance shifted from a net source of greater than 330 g c m−2 in year 1 to approximately c-neutral in year 5. total carbon (c) release over 5 years likely exceeded 630 g c m−2. intra- and interannual variations in temperature and soil water availability greatly affected annual c balance each year. gep and re were particularly sensitive to temperature during spring and to soil water availability in summer: year 5 was notable because a cold spring and accumulating drought caused growth and carbon uptake to fall well below their potential. annual evapotranspiration (et) increased slightly with leaf area, from 281 mm in year 1 to 323 mm in year 4, but in year 5 it declined, while exceeding total precipitation (p). this trend of increasing annual et/p suggests that annual gep could become increasingly water-limited in years with below normal precipitation, as the plantation achieves maximum leaf area. measured canopy albedos did not change appreciably over three winters, suggesting that estimates of increased radiative forcing resulting from afforestation in high latitudes could be exaggerated in regions where fast-growing deciduous plantations are managed on short (~20-year) rotations.
liver‐specific deletion of histone deacetylase 3 disrupts metabolic transcriptional networks antiobesity drugs that target peripheral metabolism may avoid some of the problems that have been encountered with centrally acting anorectic drugs. moreover, if they cause weight loss by increasing fat oxidation, they not only address a cause of obesity but also should promote loss of fat rather than lean tissue and improve insulin sensitivity. weight loss may be slow but more sustained than with anorectic drugs, and thermogenesis may be insufficient to cause any discomfort. some thermogenic approaches are the activation of adrenergic, thyroid hormone or growth hormone receptors and the inhibition of glucocorticoid receptors; the modulation of transcription factors [e.g. peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor δ (pparδ) activators] or enzymes [e.g. glutamine fructose‐6‐phosphate amidotransferase (gfat) inhibitors] that promote mitochondrial biogenesis, and the modulation of transcription factors (ppar α activators) or enzymes (amp‐activated protein kinase) that promote fatty acid oxidation. more surprisingly, studies on genetically modified animals and with enzyme inhibitors suggest that inhibitors of fatty acid synthesis [e.g. atp citrate lyase, fatty acid synthase, acetyl‐coa carboxylase (acc)], fatty acid interconversion [stearoyl‐coa desaturase (scd)] and triglyceride synthesis (e.g. acyl‐coa : diacylglycerol acyltransferase) may all be thermogenic. some targets have been validated only by deleting genes in the whole animal. in these cases, it is possible that deletion of the protein in the brain is responsible for the effect on adiposity, and therefore a centrally penetrant drug would be required. moreover, whilst a genetically modified mouse may display resistance to obesity in response to a high fat diet, it requires a tool compound to demonstrate that a drug might actually cause weight loss. even then, it is possible that differences between rodents and humans, such as the greater thermogenic capacity of rodents, may give a misleading impression of the potential of a drug.
a population-average mri-based atlas collection of the rhesus macaque a three-dimensional multimodality computerized map of the nemestrina monkey brain was created with serial sectioning and digital imaging techniques. an adult female macaca nemestrina (pigtail macaque) weighing 7.2 kg was used in constructing this atlas. ct, pet, and mri were performed on the monkey before the specimen's head was frozen and cryoplaned. closely spaced (50 microns) images of the specimen blockface were then digitally acquired and modified to produce whole head and brain-only 3d image sets. the resulting data sets were organized into a digital volume and repositioned into a stereotaxic coordinate system defined by horsley and clark in 1908 [7]. orthogonal images were obtained by digitally resampling the volume in order to produce a full set of coronal, sagittal, and horizontal images. stereotaxic reference grids were applied to each image indicating the a/p, m/l, or ho position within the digital volume. specific anatomic structures were outlined from the cryosection data set and 3d surface models reconstructed. structural labels indicating nuclei, tracts, and other neuroanatomical features were incorporated into coronally sliced cryosection images spaced at 500 microns. the ct, pet, and mri data sets were reconstructed into a digital volume and coregistered to the cryosection volume. all images constructed from this 3d map are available for public access via the internet using an anonymous file transfer protocol (ftp) and the world wide web (http:@www.loni.ucla.edu). the foremost advantage of this digital map is an integrated multimodality three-dimensional representation of the macaca nemestrina brain, which is not possible with traditional atlases.
optical rhinometry in nasal provocation testing activation of α2‐adrenergic receptors regulates a broad spectrum of physiologic responses, including blood pressure (centrally and peripherally), sedation, analgesia, insulin release, renal function, cognition, and behavior. the purpose of this study was to explore systematically the local vascular responses in humans triggered by a highly selective α2‐adrenergic agonist (azepexole [b‐ht 933]) and whether such responses are dose‐dependent or influenced by age, gender, or allelic variation at the drug's receptor.
self-etching aspects of a three-step etch-and-rinse adhesive purpose the objective of this study was to examine whether one-step self-etching adhesives (1-seas) really have an advantage over multistep systems.   materials and methods nine one-step self-etching adhesives (absolute, adper prompt l-pop, clearfil s3 bond, g-bond, hybrid bond, ibond, one-up bond f plus, optibond all-in-one and xeno iii) were included in this study. one two-step self-etching adhesive (clearfil se bond) and one three-step etch-and-rinse adhesive (optibond fl) served as controls. their microtensile bond strength to bur-cut enamel and dentin was determined using a standardized protocol and the respective adhesive/dentin interface of these adhesives was characterized by transmission electron microscopy. statistical analysis was performed with the kruskal-wallis nonparametric test.   results regarding bond strength, the control adhesives tended to perform superior to the one-step adhesives. however, a significant difference between the control adhesives and some one-step adhesives could not always be demonstrated, partly due to the statistical setup of this study. interface analysis by electron microscopy showed wide variation among the one-step adhesives, depending on their composition and their acidity. 1-seas also exhibited two different kinds of droplets, depending on their hydrophilicity. hydrophobic hema-free 1-seas such as g-bond were prone to phase separation, while especially hema-containing hydrophilic 1-seas, such as clearfil s3 bond and xeno iii were predisposed to forming osmosis-induced droplets. hybrid bond, absolute, and ibond featured both phase separation as well as osmosis. optibond all-in-one exhibited a clustering reaction of the filler particles upon solvent evaporation. all adhesives including the control adhesives showed signs of nanoleakage, indicating that all adhesives are to some extent permeable to water. a definitive conclusion with regard to quantitative assessment of nanoleakage was much hindered by inconsistencies in the silver deposition. the application procedure of some 1-seas sometimes proved as elaborate and time consuming as those of the two-step adhesive clearfil se bond.   conclusion considering bond strength and application procedure, 1-seas are not always a better alternative to multistep adhesives.
rna polymerase elongation factors. the universal bacterial transcription elongation factor nusa mediates elongation activities of rna polymerase. by itself, nusa induces transcription pausing and facilitates intrinsic termination, but nusa also is a cofactor of antiterminators that antagonize pausing and prevent termination. we show that nusa is required for lambda-related phage 82 antiterminator q(82) to construct a stable complex in which rna-based termination mechanisms have restricted access to the emerging transcript; this result suggests a locale for both q(82) and nusa near the beta flap domain of rna polymerase. furthermore, as nusa is not required for the antipausing activity of q(82) in vitro, we distinguish two distinct activities of antiterminators, namely antipausing and rna occlusion, and discuss their roles in q(82) function.
embryoid body formation of human amniotic fluid stem cells depends on mtor the target of rapamycin (tor) is a conserved ser/thr kinase that regulates cell growth and metabolism in response to environmental cues. here, highlighting contributions from studies in model organisms, we review mammalian tor complexes and the signaling branches they mediate. tor is part of two distinct multiprotein complexes, tor complex 1 (torc1), which is sensitive to rapamycin, and torc2, which is not. the physiological consequences of mammalian torc1 dysregulation suggest that inhibitors of mammalian tor may be useful in the treatment of cancer, cardiovascular disease, autoimmunity, and metabolic disorders.
structure-based identification, characterization, and disruption of human securin-binding sh3 domains in lung cancer the sh3 domain is perhaps the best-characterized member of the growing family of protein-interaction modules. by binding with moderate affinity and selectivity to proline-rich ligands, these domains play critical roles in a wide variety of biological processes ranging from regulation of enzymes by intramolecular interactions, increasing the local concentration or altering the subcellular localization of components of signaling pathways, and mediating the assembly of large multiprotein complexes. sh3 domains and their binding sites have cropped up in many hundreds of proteins in species from yeast to man, which suggests that they provide the cell with an especially handy and adaptable means of bringing proteins together. the wealth of genetic, biochemical and structural information available provides an intimate and detailed portrait of the domain, serving as a framework for understanding other modular protein-interaction domains. processes regulated by sh3 domains also raise important questions about the nature of specificity and the overall logic governing networks of protein interactions.
reactive sc : speculatively relaxing memory consistency model contraints using dynamic classification of cache blocks sequential consistency (sc) is arguably the most intuitive behavior for a shared-memory multithreaded program. it is widely accepted that language-level sc could significantly improve programmability of a multiprocessor system. however, efficiently supporting end-to-end sc remains a challenge as it requires that both compiler and hardware optimizations preserve sc semantics. while a recent study has shown that a compiler can preserve sc semantics for a small performance cost, an efficient and complexity-effective sc hardware remains elusive. past hardware solutions relied on aggressive speculation techniques, which has not yet been realized in a practical implementation. this paper exploits the observation that hardware need not enforce any memory model constraints on accesses to thread-local and shared read-only locations. a processor can easily determine a large fraction of these safe accesses with assistance from static compiler analysis and the hardware memory management unit. we discuss a low-complexity hardware design that exploits this information to reduce the overhead in ensuring sc. our design employs an additional unordered store buffer for fast-tracking thread-local stores and allowing later memory accesses to proceed without a memory ordering related stall. our experimental study shows that the cost of guaranteeing end-to-end sc is only 6.2% on average when compared to a system with tso hardware executing a stock compiler's output.
towards a balanced view of the bacterial tree of life silva (from latin silva, forest, http://www.arb-silva.de) is a comprehensive web resource for up to date, quality-controlled databases of aligned ribosomal rna (rrna) gene sequences from the bacteria, archaea and eukaryota domains and supplementary online services. the referred database release 111 (july 2012) contains 3 194 778 small subunit and 288 717 large subunit rrna gene sequences. since the initial description of the project, substantial new features have been introduced, including advanced quality control procedures, an improved rrna gene aligner, online tools for probe and primer evaluation and optimized browsing, searching and downloading on the website. furthermore, the extensively curated silva taxonomy and the new non-redundant silva datasets provide an ideal reference for high-throughput classification of data from next-generation sequencing approaches.
recognizing player goals in open-ended digital games with markov logic networks goal recognition for dialogue systems needs to be fast, make early predictions, and be portable. we present initial work which shows that using statistical, corpus-based methods to build goal recognizers may be a viable way to meet those needs. our goal recognizer is trained on data from apian corpus and then used to determine the agent's most likely goal based on that data. the algorithm is linear in the number of goals, and performs very well in terms of accuracy and early prediction. in addition, it is more easily portable to new domains as does not require a hand-crafted plan library.
a interaction with the cxcr 4 third intracellular loop regulates endocytosis and signaling of wt and whim-like receptors chemotaxis mediated by chemokine receptors such as cxcr4 plays a key role in lymphocyte homing and hematopoiesis as well as in breast cancer metastasis. we have demonstrated previously that β-arrestin2 functions to attenuate cxcr4-mediated g protein activation and to enhance cxcr4 internalization. here we show further that the expression of β-arrestin2 in both hela and human embryonic kidney 293 cells significantly enhances the chemotactic efficacy of stromal cell-derived factor 1α, the specific agonist of cxcr4, whereas the suppression of β-arrestin2 endogenous expression by antisense or rna-mediated interference technology considerably attenuates stromal cell-derived factor 1α-induced cell migration. expression of β-arrestin2 also augmented chemokine receptor ccr5-mediated but not epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated chemotaxis, indicating the specific effect of β-arrestin2. further analysis reveals that expression of β-arrestin2 strengthened cxcr4-mediated activation of both p38 mapk and erk, and the suppression of β-arrestin2 expression blocked the activation of two kinases. interestingly, inhibition of p38 mapk activation (but not erk activation) by its inhibitors or by expression of a dominant-negative mutant of p38 mapk effectively blocked the chemotactic effect of β-arrestin2. expression of a dominant-negative mutant of ask1 also exerted the similar blocking effect. the results of our study suggest that β-arrestin2 can function not only as a regulator of cxcr4 signaling but also as a mediator of stromal cell-derived factor 1α-induced chemotaxis and that this activity probably occurs via the ask1/p38 mapk pathway.
targeting mapk pathway in melanoma therapy the mitogen activated protein kinase (mapk) pathway plays a key role in melanoma development making it an important therapeutic target. in normal cells, the tightly regulated pathway relays extracellular signals from cell membrane to nucleus via a cascade of phosphorylation events. in melanomas, dysregulation of the mapk pathway occurs frequently due to activating mutations in the b-raf and ras genes or other genetic or epigenetic modifications, leading to increased signaling activity promoting cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, migration, survival and angiogenesis. however, identification of ideal pathway member to therapeutically target for maximal clinical benefit to melanoma patients remains a challenge. this review provides an overview of the obstacles faced targeting the mapk pathway and why certain therapeutic approaches succeed while others fail. the review summarizes the roles played by the proteins, therapeutic potential and the drugs available to target each member of the pathway as well as concerns related to each. potential for targeting multiple points and inhibiting other pathways along with mapk inhibition for optimal efficacy are discussed along with explanations for development of drug resistance, which includes discussions related to cross-talk between pathways, raf kinase isoform switching and phosphatase deregulation. finally, the use of nanotechnology is reviewed as an approach to target the mapk pathway using both genetic and pharmacological agents simultaneously targeting multiple points in the pathway or in combination with other cascades.
the practical use of esrl for conflicting interest games at the end of a thoughtful article on the future of nuclear war, wiesner and york (1) concluded that: "both sides in the arms race are ... confronted by the dilemma of steadily increasing military power and steadily decreasing national security. it is our considered professional judgment that this dilemma has no technical solution. if the great powers continue to look for solutions in the area of science and technology only, the result will be to worsen the situation." i would like to focus your attention not on the subject of the article (national security in a nuclear world) but on the kind of conclusion they reached, namely that there is no technical solution to the problem. an implicit and almost universal assumption of discussions published in professional and semipopular scientific journals is that the problem under discussion has a technical solution. a technical solution may be defined as one that requires a change only in. the techniques of the natural sciences, demanding little or nothing in the way of change in human values or ideas of morality. in our day (though not in earlier times) technical solutions are always welcome. because of previous failures in prophecy, it takes courage to assert that a desired technical solution is not possible. wiesner and york exhibited this courage; publishing in a science journal, they insisted that the solution to the problem was not to be found in the natural sciences. they cautiously qualified their statement with the phrase, "it is our considered profes-
the tgfβ pathway is a key player for the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition in the embryonic aorta. haematopoietic stem cells (hscs) are the founder cells of the adult haematopoietic system, and thus knowledge of the molecular program directing their generation during development is important for regenerative haematopoietic strategies. runx1 is a pivotal transcription factor required for hsc generation in the vascular regions of the mouse conceptus—the aorta, vitelline and umbilical arteries, yolk sac and placenta. it is thought that hscs emerge from vascular endothelial cells through the formation of intra-arterial clusters and that runx1 functions during the transition from ‘haemogenic endothelium’ to hscs. here we show by conditional deletion that runx1 activity in vascular-endothelial-cadherin-positive endothelial cells is indeed essential for intra-arterial cluster, haematopoietic progenitor and hsc formation in mice. in contrast, runx1 is not required in cells expressing vav1, one of the first pan-haematopoietic genes expressed in hscs. collectively these data show that runx1 function is essential in endothelial cells for haematopoietic progenitor and hsc formation from the vasculature, but its requirement ends once or before vav is expressed.
differential diagnosis of scrub typhus meningitis from tuberculous meningitis using clinical and laboratory features we report on a 20-year-old man who had scrub typhus with the unusual neurologic complication of brachial plexus neuropathy. the clinical features of fever, headache, pneumonitis, eschar, high weil-felix ox-k agglutination and rickettsia tsutsugamushi immunofluorescence titers confirmed the diagnosis of scrub typhus. brachial plexus neuropathy was proven by an electrophysiologic examination. he had a nearly complete recovery after adequate medical treatment.
aging, opioid-receptor agonists and antagonists, and the vestibulosympathetic reflex in humans. animal studies have demonstrated increases in sympathetic nerve outflow with vestibular stimulation. the purpose of the present study was to determine whether vestibulosympathetic reflexes are engaged in humans. muscle sympathetic nerve activity (msna), heart rate, arterial pressure, calf blood flow (cbf), and calculated calf vascular resistance (cvr; mean arterial pressure/cbf) were determined during 10 min of baseline (laying prone with chin supported) and 10 min of head-down neck flexion (hdnf). msna responses were measured in nine subjects, and calf vascular responses were determined in seven of these subjects. heart rate increased during the first minute of hdnf (71 +/- 2 to 76 +/- 3 beats/min; p < 0.05) and remained slightly elevated (71 +/- 2 to 74 +/- 3 beats/min; p < 0.05) for the duration of hdnf. diastolic and mean arterial pressures also increased slightly with hdnf (80 +/- 3 to 82 +/- 3 and 96 +/- 3 to 98 +/- 3 mmhg, respectively; p < 0.05). systolic arterial pressure did not change significantly during hdnf. cbf decreased 14% (4.63 +/- 0.78 to 3.97 +/- 0.60 ml x min(-1) x 100 ml(-1); p < 0.05), and cvr increased 12% (24.0 +/- 4.3 to 27.4 +/- 4.7 units; p < 0.05) during hdnf. these changes corresponded with significant increases in msna during hdnf. msna, expressed as burst frequency, increased from 14 +/- 2 to 20 +/- 2 bursts/min (p < 0.05) and increased 63 +/- 23% (p < 0.05) when expressed as the percent change in total activity. all variables returned to baseline during recovery. thoracic impedance measured in five subjects did not change during hdnf (19.6 +/- 1.2 to 19.7 +/- 1.5 omega), suggesting no major change in central blood volume. the results indicate that hdnf elicits increases in cvr that are mediated by the augmentation of msna. arterial pressure responses and thoracic impedance data suggest that high and low pressure baroreflexes were not the mechanism for sympathetic activation. the immediate increase in msna with hdnf suggests a role for vestibulosympathetic reflexes.
divergence measures and message passing important inference problems in statistical physics, computer vision, error-correcting coding theory, and artificial intelligence can all be reformulated as the computation of marginal probabilities on factor graphs. the belief propagation (bp) algorithm is an efficient way to solve these problems that is exact when the factor graph is a tree, but only approximate when the factor graph has cycles. we show that bp fixed points correspond to the stationary points of the bethe approximation of the free energy for a factor graph. we explain how to obtain region-based free energy approximations that improve the bethe approximation, and corresponding generalized belief propagation (gbp) algorithms. we emphasize the conditions a free energy approximation must satisfy in order to be a "valid" or "maxent-normal" approximation. we describe the relationship between four different methods that can be used to generate valid approximations: the "bethe method", the "junction graph method", the "cluster variation method", and the "region graph method". finally, we explain how to tell whether a region-based approximation, and its corresponding gbp algorithm, is likely to be accurate, and describe empirical results showing that gbp can significantly outperform bp.
the phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor roflumilast decreases ethanol consumption in c57bl/6j mice phosphodiesterase (pde) is a critical regulator of camp/protein kinase a (pka) signaling in cells. multiple pdes with different substrate specificities and subcellular localization are expressed in neurons. dopamine plays a central role in the regulation of motor and cognitive functions. the effect of dopamine is largely mediated through the camp/pka signaling cascade, and therefore controlled by pde activity. we used in vitro and in vivo biochemical techniques to dissect the roles of pde4 and pde10a in dopaminergic neurotransmission in mouse striatum by monitoring the ability of selective pde inhibitors to regulate phosphorylation of presynaptic [e.g., tyrosine hydroxylase (th)] and postsynaptic [e.g., dopamine- and camp-regulated phosphoprotein of m r 32 kda (darpp-32)] pka substrates. the pde4 inhibitor, rolipram, induced a large increase in th ser40 phosphorylation at dopaminergic terminals that was associated with a commensurate increase in dopamine synthesis and turnover in striatum in vivo. rolipram induced a small increase in darpp-32 thr34 phosphorylation preferentially in striatopallidal neurons by activating adenosine a2a receptor signaling in striatum. in contrast, the pde10a inhibitor, papaverine, had no effect on th phosphorylation or dopamine turnover, but instead robustly increased darpp-32 thr34 and glur1 ser845 phosphorylation in striatal neurons. inhibition of pde10a by papaverine activated camp/pka signaling in both striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons, resulting in potentiation of dopamine d1 receptor signaling and inhibition of dopamine d2 receptor signaling. these biochemical results are supported by immunohistochemical data demonstrating differential localization of pde10a and pde4 in striatum. these data underscore the importance of individual brain-enriched cyclic-nucleotide pde isoforms as therapeutic targets for neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders affecting dopamine neurotransmission.
influence of antidepressant drugs on macrophage cytotoxic activity in rats. histochemical studies from our (williams & felten 1981, williams et al. 1981, d. felten et al. 1981, 1984, 1985, 1987a, 1987b, livnat et al. 1985, ackerman et al. 1986, s. felten et al. 1987) and other laboratories (giron et al. 1980, bulloch & pomeranz, 1984, singh 1984, walcott & maclean 1985) have shown the presence of autonomic nerve fibers in specific compartments of both primary and secondary lymphoid organs. these nerve fibers are associated not only with blood vessels but also with lymphocytes and macrophages. we have demonstrated that the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (ne), present in the postganglionic sympathetic fibers that richly innervate lymphoid organs, acts in the spleen as both a paracrine secretion, available to receptors on cells in the white pulp, and a localized neurotransmitter in nerve terminals that directly contact t lymphocytes in the periarteriolar lymphatic sheath (pals) (s. felten et al. 1986, s. felten & olschowka 1987). we propose that ne in lymphoid organs fulfills the criteria for neurotransmission, estabushed in more traditional eftector tissues such as the heart, and plays a role in the modulation of immune responses. this review summarizes evidence for neurotransmission, including presence and compartmentation of ne, transmitter release, post-synaptic receptors on cells of the immune system, and functional consequences of denervation and pharmacological manipulation of ne. we also review aspects of development, aging, and plasticity of noradrenergic (na) fibers that enhance our understanding of their role in organs of the immune system.
seasonal separation of african savanna components using worldview-2 imagery: a comparison of pixel- and object-based approaches and selected classification algorithms this paper describes the use of probabilistic graphical models, in particular bayesian networks (bn), for the detection of two problem invasive alien plants, c. odorata and l. camara, from the recently-launched 8-band worldview-2 satellite imagery acquired on 26 september 2010 over central swaziland. the main objective of this work was to apply and evaluate the efficacy of the very high resolution multispectral satellite imagery for invasive alien plant detection using bn models. the posterior probabilities (parameters) were estimated using the expectationmaximization (em) algorithms. a comparison of the results obtained from the models indicates excellent classification accuracies above 95%, and kappa coefficient values above 0.90. the highest classification accuracies of 99% were obtained when using the newer bands. the main result obtained in this study is that the new worldview-2 bands are effective for alien invasive species detection. the bn approach considered here provide relatively similar and accurate solutions for the classification of the multispectral image although the l. camara model was marginally competitive relative to the c. odorata model when measured in terms of the brier score and the logarithmic loss. the results point to the potential usefulness and applicability of the additional bands from the worldview-2 satellite for very high resolution plant species detection and monitoring.
between-trial inhibition and facilitation in goal-directed aiming: manual and spatial asymmetries consistent with action–based theories of attention, the presence of a nontarget stimulus in the environment has been shown to alter the characteristics of goal–directed movements. specifically, it has been reported that movement trajectories veer away from (howard & tipper, 1997) or towards (welsh, elliott, & weeks, 1999) the location of a nontarget stimulus. the purpose of the experiments reported in this paper was to test a response activation model of selective reaching conceived to account for these variable results. in agreement with the model, the trajectory changes in the movements appear to be determined by the activation levels of each competing response at the moment of response initiation. the results of the present work, as well as those of previous studies, are discussed within the framework of the model of response activation.
crucial role of the residue r280 at the f′–g′ loop of the human granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor α chain for ligand recognition granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf) or interleukin-3 (il-3) suppress apoptosis in hemopoietic cells, a process of active cell death characterized by the degradation of genomic dna into oligonucleosomic fragments. the present study was therefore initiated with the view that the two growth factors may trigger the same early events in the cell, leading to suppression of apoptosis. we provide evidence here for a role of protein kinase c and of the na+/h+ antiporter in the signal transduction pathways activated by binding of gm-csf or il-3 to their respective receptors, resulting in suppression of apoptosis in target cells. first, kinetic studies indicate that the process is irreversible after two hours of deprivation. the suppression of apoptosis by gm-csf and il-3 is dose-dependent, with half-efficient concentrations that are in the range of the dissociation constants of the high affinity gm-csf or il-3 receptor, respectively. second, the use of three inhibitors of protein kinase c (pkc), h7, staurosporine, and sphingosine, in concentrations that are below their toxicity limits, revert the suppression of apoptosis by il-3 and gm-csf. conversely, the use of 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (tpa), a pkc activator, allows a bypass of receptor activation in suppression of apoptosis. western blotting of cytosolic and membrane proteins indicate that exposure of the cells to gm-csf, il-3, or tpa results in translocation of pkc to the cell membrane. our data, therefore, indicate that the activation of pkc is important in suppression of apoptosis by gm-csf and il-3. third, the two amiloride derivatives 5-(n,n-hexamethylene) and 5-(n-ethyl-n-isopropyl)amiloride that specifically block the function of the na+/h+ antiport also revert the protective effect of gm-csf, il-3, and tpa on mo7-e cells. further, exposure of the cells to gm-csf, il-3, or tpa results in sustained phi alkalinizatio, which is abrogated when the cells are preincubated with 5-(n-ethyl-n-isopropyl)amiloride, a specific inhibitor of the antiport. preincubation of the cells with staurosporine, a pkc inhibitor, also significantly reduces the effect of gm-csf or il-3 on phi. taken together, our data indicate that a functional antiport is required in suppression of apoptosis by gm-csf, il-3, or tpa. furthermore, our results are consistent with the view that gm-csf or il-3 receptor activation initiates the sequential activation of pkc and of the na+/h+ antiporter, resulting in suppression of apoptosis in target cells.
trka as a life and death receptor: receptor dose as a mediator of function. the term apoptosis was proposed to define a type of cell death morphologically, biochemically, and molecularly distinct from necrosis, which plays a fundamental regulatory function in the control of the overall size of cell populations, being complementary but opposite to cell proliferation [kerr et al. (1972): br j cancer 26:239–257]. this view has led to the appreciation that apoptosis is an integral part of normal biological processes and may impact on disease states. introduction of the concept of apoptosis has raised great interest and many studies have been aimed to the identification of genes responsible for the induction of cell death. indeed, over the past few years, many genes whose expression is associated with cell death have been described, and the molecular mechanisms underlying cell death have been, in some circumstances, clearly established. however, it is now evident that extension of the conclusions achieved by studies performed with highly selected in vitro systems (simple systems), to in vivo conditions (complex systems), has generated a certain degree of confusion. this is in part due to the indiscriminate use of the term apoptosis and to the uncertainty whether apoptosis is always different from necrosis, and, if this is the case, to the lack of well established criteria to discriminate the two processes; in addition, in addition, it still remains to be established whether both types of cell death, although different, could be induced simultaneously by the same agent, depending on the cell type and the experimental condition used. the distinction between apoptosis and necrosis, is not simply a problem of terminology; if necrosis and apoptosis are different from a mechanistic point of view, and if necrosis is merely the passive result of cellular injury (still to be shown), it becomes critical to discriminate between the two processes, in order to understand how to modulate apoptosis in view of its potential therapeutic use. this review will summarize existing informations and discuss some of the conflicting issues related to cell death in the liver.
integrated stratigraphy of the paleocene‐eocene thermal maximum in the new jersey coastal plain: toward understanding the effects of global warming in a shelf environment publisher summary this chapter focuses on the paleoceanographical proxies based on deep-sea benthic foraminiferal assemblage characteristics, and presents the following three proxy relationships that are promising: those between benthic foraminiferal faunas and benthic ecosystem oxygenation, export productivity, and deep-sea water mass characteristics. under most circumstances the composition of deep-sea benthic foraminiferal assemblages is controlled by a rather limited number of environmental factors. the available proxies based on benthic foraminiferal assemblage composition show that they have major potential, but further research is needed to add or improve the quantitative aspects. in many cases, such as bottom water oxygenation, and corg flux to the ocean floor, it can be done by significantly increasing the size of existing databases. in other cases such as periodicity of the organic flux, time series observations are necessary. a major obstacle is insufficient knowledge of the differences between recent and fossil faunas due to taphonomical alterations. this phenomenon, of importance for all paleoceanographic proxies, can to some extent be solved relatively easily in the case of foraminiferal assemblages by detailed studies of their vertical succession in sediments deposited in the last 5,000 years, when environmental conditions were probably rather invariable in many areas. proxies based on foraminiferal assemblage composition are fundamentally different from all geochemical proxies, and thus may provide independent reconstructions of essential oceanographic parameters.
thyroid dysfunction can predict response to immunotherapy with interleukin-2 and interferon-2 alpha. we recently showed that human thyroid epithelial cells, which are normally negative for hla-dr molecules, express hla-dr in thyroid autoimmunity. furthermore, induction of hla-dr on normal thyroid cells can be achieved by culture with plant lectins. we have now found that recombinant human interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) induces expression of hla-dr molecules on cultured human thyroid cells, whereas namalva ifn-alpha, recombinant ifn-beta or recombinant interleukin-2 (il-2) do not. all three ifn, but not il-2, enhanced thyroid cell hla-a,b,c expression. the results strongly implicate t cells (which are the source of ifn-gamma) in the aberrant induction of dr on thyroid epithelial cells which is proposed to be a central feature of the immunopathological processes leading to autoimmunity.
elicitation of diosgenin production in trigonella foenum-graecum l. seedlings by heavy metals and signaling molecules abstract a23187 is a carboxylic acid antibiotic which simultaneously uncouples oxidative phosphorylation and inhibits atpase of rat liver mitochondria incubated in a magnesium-free medium. the antibiotic acts as a freely mobile carrier to transport calcium and magnesium, but not potassium, from an aqueous medium buffered at ph 7.4 into a bulk organic phase. a23187 causes a progressive release of endogenous magnesium and inorganic phosphate from mitochondria incubated with substrate, but little change in calcium or potassium content. if edta is added, a23187 severely depletes intramitochondrial calcium and magnesium in l30 s and produces loss of intramitochondrial potassium. release of state 4 succinate oxidation by a23187 is inhibited by lanthanum chloride, ruthenium red, ((ethylene bis)oxyethylene nitrilo)tetraacetic acid (egta), edta, mgcl2, and atp. inhibition by egta (or edta) of a23187's uncoupling is reversed readily by calcium but not magnesium. in the presence of a23187 plus egta, mitochondria retain only 2 to 3 nmoles of mg2+ per mg of protein but remain coupled and phosphorylate adp at 80 to 85% of control rates with β-hydroxybutyrate or succinate as substrate. under these conditions, coupled phosphorylation supported by glutamate, and atp hydrolysis are severely depressed, but increasing concentrations of magnesium in the incubating medium prevent these inhibitions. it is proposed that a cyclic, energy-dissipating flux of mitochondrial calcium accounts for uncoupling by a23187, whereas inhibition of atpase and glutamate oxidation and increased potassium permeability of mitochondria result from antibiotic-mediated magnesium efflux.
prediction of ovarian cancer prognosis and response to chemotherapy by a serum-based multiparametric biomarker panel epithelial ovarian cancer constitutes one-quarter of the gynecologic malignancies, but is the leading cause of death among women with gynecologic cancer. in 6070% of the women, the disease is detected at a late stage when 5-year survival is poor. the recommended primary therapeutic approach for ovarian cancer is aggressive primarydebulking surgery followed by combination chemotherapy. the efficacy is routinely evaluated by repeated vaginal examination and transabdominal ultrasonography. however, these methods are unreliable for monitoring as progressive and recurrent disease often remains hidden until the patient presents with a large tumor mass. over the last few decades a variety of serological tumor markers has been proposed as a supplement to other non-invasive diagnostic methods. the main issue with tumor marker measurements is to obtain reliable information about changes in tumor mass before the changes are detectable by other methods. however, despite several attempts to identify useful serological markers for epithelial ovarian cancer, the results have not been as encouraging as for germ-cell tumors. the purpose of this paper is to review the applicability of ca 125, cea, tpa, tati, casa, and tetranectin in screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of ovarian carcinoma. several compounds other than those mentioned above are being investigated as markers in the early detection and management of ovarian cancer. some ofthese potential tumor markers listed in table 1 will not be discussed further in this review.
evolution of crisps associated with toxicoferan-reptilian venom and mammalian reproduction. in studies of blood coagulation and the vascular system, snake venom toxins have been indispensable in elucidating the complex physiological mechanisms that govern coagulation and the vascular system in mammals, given their potency and highly specific biological effects. the various components of snake venom toxins can be classified according to their mechanism of action, for example, serine proteases, metalloproteinases, kunitz-type protease inhibitors, phospholipases a(2), (l)-amino acid oxidases, c-type lectin(-like) proteins, disintegrins, vascular endothelial growth factors, three-finger toxins, and cysteine-rich secretory proteins. although the molecular structures of most toxins are not unique to snake venom toxins, venom proteins often exhibit marked diversity in their biological effects, despite their structural similarities. in this review, we identify several snake venom toxins capable of affecting blood coagulation and the vascular system, as well as various toxins from other organisms, including leeches and ticks.
alternative interventions to prevent oxidative damage following ischemia/reperfusion oxidative stress is considered a major contributor to etiology of both “normal” senescence and severe pathologies with serious public health implications. mitochondria generate reactive oxygen species (ros) that are thought to augment intracellular oxidative stress. mitochondria possess at least nine known sites that are capable of generating superoxide anion, a progenitor ros. mitochondria also possess numerous ros defense systems that are much less studied. studies of the last three decades shed light on many important mechanistic details of mitochondrial ros production, but the bigger picture remains obscure. this review summarizes the current knowledge about major components involved in mitochondrial ros metabolism and factors that regulate ros generation and removal. an integrative, systemic approach is applied to analysis of mitochondrial ros metabolism, which is now dissected into mitochondrial ros production, mitochondrial ros removal, and mitochondrial ros emission. it is suggested that mitochondria augment intracellular oxidative stress due primarily to failure of their ros removal systems, whereas the role of mitochondrial ros emission is yet to be determined and a net increase in mitochondrial ros production in situ remains to be demonstrated.
the prototype effect revisited: evidence for an abstract feature model of face recognition. behavioral sensitivity to object transformations and the response to novel objects (greebles) in the fusiform face area (ffa) was measured several times during expertise training. sensitivity to 3 transformations increased with expertise: (a) configural changes in which halves of objects were misaligned, (b) configural changes in which some of the object parts were moved, and (c) the substitution of an object part with a part from a different object. the authors found that holistic-configural effects can arise from object representations that are differentiated in terms of features or parts. moreover, a holistic-inclusive effect was correlated with changes in the right ffa. face recognition may not be unique in its reliance on holistic processing, measured in terms of both behavior and brain activation.
influence of antidepressant drugs on macrophage cytotoxic activity in rats. histochemical studies from our (williams & felten 1981, williams et al. 1981, d. felten et al. 1981, 1984, 1985, 1987a, 1987b, livnat et al. 1985, ackerman et al. 1986, s. felten et al. 1987) and other laboratories (giron et al. 1980, bulloch & pomeranz, 1984, singh 1984, walcott & maclean 1985) have shown the presence of autonomic nerve fibers in specific compartments of both primary and secondary lymphoid organs. these nerve fibers are associated not only with blood vessels but also with lymphocytes and macrophages. we have demonstrated that the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (ne), present in the postganglionic sympathetic fibers that richly innervate lymphoid organs, acts in the spleen as both a paracrine secretion, available to receptors on cells in the white pulp, and a localized neurotransmitter in nerve terminals that directly contact t lymphocytes in the periarteriolar lymphatic sheath (pals) (s. felten et al. 1986, s. felten & olschowka 1987). we propose that ne in lymphoid organs fulfills the criteria for neurotransmission, estabushed in more traditional eftector tissues such as the heart, and plays a role in the modulation of immune responses. this review summarizes evidence for neurotransmission, including presence and compartmentation of ne, transmitter release, post-synaptic receptors on cells of the immune system, and functional consequences of denervation and pharmacological manipulation of ne. we also review aspects of development, aging, and plasticity of noradrenergic (na) fibers that enhance our understanding of their role in organs of the immune system.
does climate change explain the decline of a trans-saharan afro-palaearctic migrant? the variability of two fitness–related phenotypic traits (body weight and a mandibular skeletal ratio) was analysed among cohorts and age–classes of red deer in norway. phenotypic variation among cohorts was pronounced for calves, yearlings and reproductively mature adults. fluctuations in cohort–specific mean body weights and skeletal ratios of adults correlated with global climatic variation in winter conditions influenced by the north atlantic oscillation while cohorts were in utero. red deer born following warm winters were smaller than those born after cold winters, and this inter–cohort variability persisted into adulthood. phenotypic variation among cohorts of red deer influenced by climate change may pose consequences for fitness of cohorts since body size and condition contribute to reproductive success and survival in male and female red deer. in particular, the recent trend of increasingly warm winters in northern europe and scandinavia may lead to reduced body size and fecundity of red deer, and perhaps other ungulates, in those areas.
ccl2 and ccl5 driven attraction of cd172a+ monocytic cells during an equine herpesvirus type 1 (ehv-1) infection in equine nasal mucosa and the impact of two migration inhibitors, rosiglitazone (rsg) and quinacrine (qc) herpes simplex virus-type 1 is among the most prevalent and successful humans pathogens. although infection is largely uncomplicated in the immunocompetent human host, hsv-1 infection can cause blinding corneal disease, and individuals with defects in innate or adaptive immunity are susceptible to herpes simplex encephalitis. chemokines regulate leukocyte trafficking to inflamed tissues and play a crucial role in orchestrating the immune response to hsv-1 infection. in this review we will focus on the pathways that induce chemokine expression during hsv-1 infection and the implications of chemokine signaling on control of viral replication.
scale invariant texture classification using fuzzy logic conventional gabor representation and its extracted features often yield a fairly poor performance in retrieving the rotated and scaled versions of the texture image under query. to address this issue, existing methods exploit multiple stages of transformations for making rotation and/or scaling being invariant at the expense of high computational complexity and degraded retrieval performance. the latter is mainly due to the lost of image details after multiple transformations. in this paper, a rotation-invariant and a scale-invariant gabor representations are proposed, where each representation only requires few summations on the conventional gabor filter impulse responses. the optimum setting of the orientation parameter and scale parameter is experimentally determined over the brodatz and mpeg-7 texture databases. features are then extracted from these new representations for conducting rotation-invariant or scale-invariant texture image retrieval. since the dimension of the new feature space is much reduced, this leads to a much smaller metadata storage space and faster on-line computation on the similarity measurement. simulation results clearly show that our proposed invariant gabor representations and their extracted invariant features significantly outperform the conventional gabor representation approach for rotation-invariant and scale-invariant texture image retrieval.
abnormal default-mode network homogeneity in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) studies have demonstrated that the resting state networks (rsns) are impaired in various neuropsychiatric disorders. however, little is known about the changes in the functional architecture of the rsns in idiopathic generalized epilepsy patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures (gtcs). resting state fmri data were acquired from 16 gtcs patients and 16 healthy subjects. the data were acquired during interictal without combined eeg confirmation. functional connectivity among the rsns was examined using individual-based independent component analysis. six rsns were identified in both the gtcs and control groups. compared with the healthy subjects, decreased functional connectivity in the self-referential, somatosensory, visual, and auditory networks, and both the decreased and increased functional connectivities in the classic default-mode and dorsal attention networks were found in the gtcs patients. furthermore, the present study revealed a negative correlation between the seizure duration and functional connectivity changes in the medial prefrontal cortex in the gtcs patients. these results indicate that there are impairments in the rsns and possible reorganization of the default-mode network and dorsal attention network in patients with gtcs. our findings may also suggest that the medial prefrontal cortex and its associated network play a role in the development of gtcs.
systematic screening reveals a role for brca1 in the response to transcription-associated dna damage. cullin 4 (cul4)‐based ubiquitin ligases emerged as critical regulators of dna replication and repair. over 50 cul4‐specific adaptors (dna damage‐binding 1 (ddb1)–cul4‐associated factors; dcafs) have been identified and are thought to assemble functionally distinct cul4 complexes. using a live‐cell imaging‐based rnai screen, we analysed the function of dcafs and cul4‐linked proteins, and identified specific subsets required for progression through g1 and s phase. we discovered c6orf167/mms22‐like protein (mms22l) as a putative human orthologue of budding yeast mms22, which, together with cullin rtt101, regulates genome stability by promoting dna replication through natural pause sites and damaged templates. loss of mms22l function in human cells results in s phase‐dependent genomic instability characterised by spontaneous double‐strand breaks and dna damage checkpoint activation. unlike yeast mms22, human mms22l does not stably bind to cul4, but is degraded in a cul4‐dependent manner and upon replication stress. mms22l physically and functionally interacts with the scaffold‐like protein nfkbil2 that co‐purifies with histones, several chromatin remodelling and dna replication/repair factors. together, our results strongly suggest that the mms22l–nfkbil2 complex contributes to genome stability by regulating the chromatin state at stalled replication forks.
mutations in the n-terminal coding region of the harpin protein hpa1 from xanthomonas oryzae cause loss of hypersensitive reaction induction in tobacco the hrp gene clusters of plant pathogenic bacteria control pathogenicity on their host plants and ability to elicit the hypersensitive reaction in resistant plants. some hrp gene products constitute elements of the type iii secretion system, by which effector proteins are exported and delivered into plant cells. here, we show that the hrpz gene product from the bean halo-blight pathogen, pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola (hrpz(psph)), is secreted in an hrp-dependent manner in p. syringae pv. phaseolicola and exported by the type iii secretion system in the mammalian pathogen yersinia enterocolitica. hrpz(psph) was found to associate stably with liposomes and synthetic bilayer membranes. under symmetric ionic conditions, addition of 2 nm of purified recombinant hrpz(psph) to the cis compartment of planar lipid bilayers provoked an ion current with a large unitary conductivity of 207 ps. hrpz(psph)-related proteins from p. syringae pv. tomato or syringae triggered ion currents similar to those stimulated by hrpz(psph). the hrpz(psph)-mediated ion-conducting pore was permeable for cations but did not mediate fluxes of cl-. such pore-forming activity may allow nutrient release and/or delivery of virulence factors during bacterial colonization of host plants.
dialog intent structure: a hierarchical schema of linked dialog acts this paper summarizes the latest, final version of iso standard 24617-2 ``semantic annotation framework, part 2: dialogue acts"""". compared to the preliminary version iso dis 24617-2:2010, described in bunt et al. (2010), the final version additionally includes concepts for annotating rhetorical relations between dialogue units, defines a full-blown compositional semantics for the dialogue act markup language diaml (resulting, as a side-effect, in a different treatment of functional dependence relations among dialogue acts and feedback dependence relations); and specifies an optimally transparent xml-based reference format for the representation of diaml annotations, based on the systematic application of the notion of `ideal concrete syntax'. we describe these differences and briefly discuss the design and implementation of an incremental method for dialogue act recognition, which proves the usability of the iso standard for automatic dialogue annotation.
kinetic parameter estimation in lab-scale catalysis testing-a critical evaluation based on computational fluid dynamics abstract catalytic ignition of mixtures of h2 + o2 has been studied, with emphasis on the dynamics behavior, by measuring and simulating the temporal evolution from the kinetically controlled regime (i.e., prior to ignition) to the state controlled by mass transport after ignition. in the experiments, different non flammable mixtures of h2 + o2 (with n2 as diluent) react catalytically to form h2o on a pt-wire at a total pressure of 1 atm. the transient behavior from the ignition point to the state controlled by mass transport was measured via the temperature of the pt-wire. these zero flow experiments were simulated by a code which describes reacting flows with diffusion, heat balance and detailed surface kinetics. the evolution of the catalyst's temperature, the surface coverages and the gradients in the reactants' concentrations and temperature were calculated. good agreement was obtained between the experiments and the simulations. the results provide new insight into both the mechanism of catalytic ignition and the relative importance of reaction kinetics and mass transfer at different stages. catalytic ignition of h2 + o2 is primarily governed by coupling between: (i) the heat balance, (ii) the kinetics of adsorption of h2 and o2, and (iii) the desorption kinetics of h2. the model presented can be applied to ignition or combustion, where heterogeneous processes are coupled to those in the gaseous phase.
gnx-4728, a novel small molecule drug inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition, is therapeutic in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis alzheimer’s disease (ad), parkinson’s disease (pd) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) are the most common human adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases. they are characterized by prominent age-related neurodegeneration in selectively vulnerable neural systems. some forms of ad, pd, and als are inherited, and genes causing these diseases have been identified. nevertheless, the mechanisms of the neuronal cell death are unresolved. morphological, biochemical, genetic, as well as cell and animal model studies reveal that mitochondria could have roles in this neurodegeneration. the functions and properties of mitochondria might render subsets of selectively vulnerable neurons intrinsically susceptible to cellular aging and stress and overlying genetic variations, triggering neurodegeneration according to a cell death matrix theory. in ad, alterations in enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, oxidative damage, and mitochondrial binding of aβ and amyloid precursor protein have been reported. in pd, mutations in putative mitochondrial proteins have been identified and mitochondrial dna mutations have been found in neurons in the substantia nigra. in als, changes occur in mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes and mitochondrial cell death proteins. transgenic mouse models of human neurodegenerative disease are beginning to reveal possible principles governing the biology of selective neuronal vulnerability that implicate mitochondria and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. this review summarizes how mitochondrial pathobiology might contribute to neuronal death in ad, pd, and als and could serve as a target for drug therapy.
mycosphaerellaceae and teratosphaeriaceae associated with eucalyptus leaf diseases and stem cankers in uruguay mycosphaerella heimii was found associated with foliage of eucalyptus dunnii in a plantation in south-east queensland in may 2004. this is the first record of mycosphaerella heimii in australia.
co-modulation of an allosteric modulator of nicotinic receptor-cholinesterase inhibitor (galantamine) and a 5-ht4 receptor agonist (rs-67333): effect on scopolamine-induced memory deficit in the mouse the processing of amyloid precursor protein (app) to amyloid beta (aβ) is of great interest to the alzheimer's disease (ad) field. decades of research define how app is altered to form aβ, and how aβ generates oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrils. numerous signaling pathways and changes in cell physiology are known to influence app processing. existing data additionally indicate a relationship exists between mitochondria, bioenergetics, and app processing. here, we review data that address whether mitochondrial function and bioenergetics modify app processing and aβ production.
moderate intensity exercise training reverses functional aerobic impairment in hiv-infected individuals we attempted to measure cardiopulmonary effects, cd4 counts, and perceived sense of well-being in 25 individuals moderately to severely immunocompromised from hiv infection (mean entry cd4 count = 144.microliters-1) before and after a 24-wk program of exercise training. only six subjects completed the 24-wk program. all six showed evidence of a training effect. statistically significant improvements were seen in maximal oxygen consumption (vo2max), oxygen pulse, and minute ventilation. submaximal exercise performance improved significantly by 12 wk in the 10 individuals available for testing: decreases were seen in heart rate, rate pressure product, and rate of perceived exertion. white blood cell counts and t-lymphocyte subsets were stable at 12 and 24 wk in the subjects available for testing. high depression/anxiety scores on a mental health inventory (general health questionnaire) correlated with low cd4 counts. scores did not correlate with compliance with the exercise program. there was a trend (p < 0.10) for scores to improve over time among those individuals who attended > or = 80% of scheduled exercise sessions. we conclude that exercise training is feasible and beneficial for some hiv-infected individuals.
proteome changes in the initial bacterial colonist during ecological succession in an acid mine drainage biofilm community. bacterial species concepts are controversial. more widely accepted is the need to understand how differences in gene content and sequence lead to ecological divergence. to address this relationship in ecosystem context, we investigated links between genotype and ecology of two genotypic groups of leptospirillum group ii bacteria in comprehensively characterized, natural acidophilic biofilm communities. these groups share 99.7% 16s rrna gene sequence identity and 95% average amino acid identity between their orthologs. one genotypic group predominates during early colonization, and the other group typically proliferates in later successional stages, forming distinct patches tens to hundreds of micrometers in diameter. among early colonizing populations, we observed dominance of five genotypes that differed from each other by the extent of recombination with the late colonizing type. our analyses suggest that the specific recombinant variant within the early colonizing group is selected for by environmental parameters such as temperature, consistent with recombination as a mechanism for ecological fine tuning. evolutionary signatures, and strain-resolved expression patterns measured via mass spectrometry–based proteomics, indicate increased cobalamin biosynthesis, (de)methylation, and glycine cleavage in the late colonizer. this may suggest environmental changes within the biofilm during development, accompanied by redirection of compatible solutes from osmoprotectants toward metabolism. across 27 communities, comparative proteogenomic analyses show that differential regulation of shared genes and expression of a small subset of the ∼15% of genes unique to each genotype are involved in niche partitioning. in summary, the results show how subtle genetic variations can lead to distinct ecological strategies.
arterial pressure: agreement between a brachial cuff-based device and radial tonometry aims brachial systolic blood pressure (bsbp) exceeds aortic pressure by a variable amount, and estimated central systolic blood pressure (csbp) may be a better indicator of cardiovascular risk than bsbp. we undertook a systematic review and meta‐analysis to compare the effect of single and multiple antihypertensive agents on bsbp, csbp and augmentation index (aix).
pinnacle revision cup in acetabular surgery results at 2 to 5 years. periprosthetic bone loss, associated with failed acetabular implants, results in disruption of hip mechanics and complicates further reconstruction. to restore normal biomechanics and idealize implant loads, restoration of the normal center of rotation of the hip is recommended. johnston et al have shown that medial, inferior, and anterior placement of the acetabular component minimizes prosthetic loading, whereas lateralizing the socket relative to the normal center greatly increases joint reactive forces. since 1984, i have made every effort to restore the normal hip center, within reason, when dealing with the bony deficient acetabulum. in most every socket revision performed during this period, cavitary lesions have been addressed simply with particulate bone grafting or a larger component. to justify the use of structural allografts for the management of segmental defects, i believe the defect must involve the supporting rim, comprise the ability to obtain prosthetic stability, compromise the ability to restore normal hip mechanics, and be located in a high-stress area, i.e., posterior or posterior-superior. smaller rim defects, in particular those located superior and anterior, can be ignored if they do not lead to prosthetic instability. some alteration in hip mechanics can be tolerated to avoid structural allografting, but i have elected not to accept a superior translation of greater than 2 cm nor a medial defect that compromises the ability to lateralize the prosthesis adequately towards the normal center. when segmental defects exist while the prosthesis is well contained and stable in host bone (particularly superior and posterior), structural allografts are not necessary. a possible need for bone graft exists when there is questionable stability of the implant, i.e., a segmental defect combined with poor quality host bone, and when a major part of the posterior or superior rim of the component remains uncovered. the age and activity level of the patient enter into this formula at this point, and when the question exists in a younger patient, bone grafting should be performed. a definite need for structural allografting exists when component stability cannot be obtained in host bone, when there is a loss of the weight-bearing portion of the acetabular, particularly posterior, superior, or both, and when a major alteration of hip mechanics has occurred where no medial support or superior translation of greater than 2 cm has occurred. prosthetic selection can affect the long-term results of acetabular reconstruction. smooth-threaded components and bipolars have not performed well in revision acetabular surgery.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
infectious disease surveillance for the london 2012 olympic and paralympic games. background the london 2012 olympic and paralympic games is a mass gathering event that will present a major public health challenge. the health protection agency, in collaboration with the college of emergency medicine, has established the emergency department sentinel syndromic surveillance system (edsss) to support the public health surveillance requirements of the games. methods this feasibility study assesses the usefulness of edsss in monitoring indicators of disease in the community. daily counts of anonymised attendance data from six emergency departments across england were analysed by patient demographics (age, gender, partial postcode), triage coding and diagnosis codes. generic and specific syndromic indicators were developed using aggregations of diagnosis codes recorded during each attendance. results over 339 000 attendances were recorded (26 july 2010 to 25 july 2011). the highest attendances recorded on weekdays between 10:00 and 11:00 and on weekends between 12:00 and 13:00. the mean daily attendance per emergency department was 257 (range 38–435). syndromic indicators were developed including: respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiac, acute respiratory infection, gastroenteritis and myocardial ischaemia. respiratory and acute respiratory infection indicators peaked during december 2010, concomitant with national influenza activity, as monitored through other influenza surveillance systems. conclusions the edsss has been established to provide an enhanced surveillance system for the london 2012 olympics. further validation of the data will be required; however, the results from this initial descriptive study demonstrate the potential for identifying unusual and/or severe outbreaks of infectious disease, or other incidents with public health impact, within the community.
molecular analysis of bacterial microbiota on brazilian currency note surfaces paper currency and coins may be a public health risk when associated with the simultaneous handling of food and could lead to the spread of nosocomial infections. banknotes recovered from hospitals may be highly contaminated by staphylococcus aureus. salmonella species, escherichia coli and s. aureus are commonly isolated from banknotes from food outlets. laboratory simulations revealed that methicillin-resistant s. aureus can easily survive on coins, whereas e. coli, salmonella species and viruses, including human influenza virus, norovirus, rhinovirus, hepatitis a virus, and rotavirus, can be transmitted through hand contact. large-scale, 16s rrna, metagenomic studies and culturomics have the capacity to dramatically expand the known diversity of bacteria and viruses on money and fomites. this review summarizes the latest research on the potential of paper currency and coins to serve as sources of pathogenic agents.
a vision: rdb-based xml security models considering data levels nowadays many organizations share sensitive services through open network systems and this raises the need for an authorization framework that can interoperate even when the parties have no pre-existing relationships. trust negotiation is the process used to establish these first relationships, through the transfer of attributes, embedded in digital credentials, between the two parties. however, these attributes may themselves be considered sensitive and so may need protection from disclosure. in some environments, the policies that govern the protected services may also be considered sensitive and their release to arbitrary strangers may leak confidential business information. this paper describes a way to unify the protection of services, sensitive credentials and policies in a synchronized trustworthy manner. we propose a trust authorization framework (taf) that builds on the capabilities of xacml to support the bilateral exchange of policies and credentials through trust negotiation
number of aberrant crypt foci associated with adiposity and igf1 bioavailability there is increasing evidence that dysregulation of energy homeostasis is associated with colorectal carcinogenesis. epidemiological data have consistently demonstrated a positive relation between increased body size and colorectal malignancy, whereas mechanistic studies have sought to uncover obesity-related carcinogenic pathways. the phenomenon of "insulin resistance" or the impaired ability to normalize plasma glucose levels has formed the core of these pathways, but other mechanisms have also been advanced. obesity-induced insulin resistance leads to elevated levels of plasma insulin, glucose and fatty acids. exposure of the colonocyte to heightened concentrations of insulin may induce a mitogenic effect within these cells, whereas exposure to glucose and fatty acids may induce metabolic perturbations, alterations in cell signaling pathways and oxidative stress. the importance of chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of obesity has recently been highlighted and may represent an additional mechanism linking increased adiposity to colorectal carcinogenesis. this review provides an overview of the epidemiology of body size and colorectal neoplasia and outlines current knowledge of putative mechanisms advanced to explain this relation. family based studies have shown that the propensity to become obese is heritable, but this is only manifest in conditions of excess energy intake over expenditure. inheritance of a genetic profile that predisposes to increased body size may also be predictive of colorectal cancer. genomewide scans, linkage studies and candidate gene investigations have highlighted more than 400 chromosomal regions that may harbor variants that predispose to increased body size. the genetics underlying the pathogenesis of obesity are likely to be complex, but variants in a range of different genes have already been associated with increased body size and insulin resistance. these include genes encoding elements of insulin signaling, adipocyte metabolism and differentiation, and regulation of energy expenditure. a number of investigators have begun to study genetic variants within these pathways in relation to colorectal neoplasia, but at present data remain limited to a handful of studies. these pathways will be discussed with particular reference to genetic polymorphisms that have been associated with obesity and insulin resistance.
capsaicin protects cardiomyocytes against anoxia/reoxygenation injury via preventing mitochondrial dysfunction mediated by sirt1 yeast silent information regulator 2 (sir2), a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide–dependent histone deacetylase (hdac) and founding member of the hdac class iii family, functions in a wide array of cellular processes, including gene silencing, longevity, and dna damage repair. we examined whether or not the mammalian ortholog sir2 affects growth and death of cardiac myocytes. cardiac myocytes express sir2&agr; predominantly in the nucleus. neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were treated with 20 mmol/l nicotinamide (nam), a sir2 inhibitor, or 50 nmol/l trichostatin a (tsa), a class i and ii hdac inhibitor. nam induced a significant increase in nuclear fragmentation (2.2-fold) and cleaved caspase-3, as did sirtinol, a specific sir2 inhibitor, and expression of dominant-negative sir2&agr;. tsa also modestly increased cell death (1.5-fold) but without accompanying caspase-3 activation. although tsa induced a 1.5-fold increase in cardiac myocyte size and protein content, nam reduced both. in addition, nam caused acetylation and increases in the transcriptional activity of p53, whereas tsa did not. nam-induced cardiac myocyte apoptosis was inhibited in the presence of dominant-negative p53, suggesting that sir2&agr; inhibition causes apoptosis through p53. overexpression of sir2&agr; protected cardiac myocytes from apoptosis in response to serum starvation and significantly increased the size of cardiac myocytes. furthermore, sir2 expression was increased significantly in hearts from dogs with heart failure induced by rapid pacing superimposed on stable, severe hypertrophy. these results suggest that endogenous sir2&agr; plays an essential role in mediating cell survival, whereas sir2&agr; overexpression protects myocytes from apoptosis and causes modest hypertrophy. in contrast, inhibition of endogenous class i and ii hdacs primarily causes cardiac myocyte hypertrophy and also induces modest cell death. an increase in sir2 expression during heart failure suggests that sir2 may play a cardioprotective role in pathologic hearts in vivo.
a new twist on an old idea part 2: cyclosporine preserves normal mitochondrial but not cardiomyocyte function in mini‐swine with compensated heart failure background heart failure in patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function (hfpef) is a prevalent disease characterized by exercise intolerance with poorly understood pathophysiology. we hypothesized that recruitable contractility is impaired in hfpef, accounting for the appearance of symptoms with exertion.   methods and results echocardiographic analysis of myocardial performance was performed at baseline and after a modified dobutamine protocol (max dose 16 μg/kg/min) in participants with known hfpef and age- and gender-matched controls. the primary outcome variable was change in contractile reserve, measured as a change in ejection fraction (ef). recruitable contractility was decreased in hfpef participants compared with control subjects (hfpef 0.4 ± 1.9% vs control 19.0 ± 1.4%; p < .001). during dobutamine infusion, velocities increased in control participants but remained unchanged in the hfpef group, yielding a significant difference between groups (p < .05) for both longitudinal displacement and velocity.   conclusions patients with hfpef have an impaired contractile response to adrenergic stimulation. the blunted response to adrenergic stimulation in the hfpef group suggests that these patients may be unable to respond to periods of increased cardiac demand. this inability to increase contractility appropriately suggests abnormalities of systolic function in this disease and may contribute to exertional intolerance in hfpef.
ebf factors drive expression of multiple classes of target genes governing neuronal development neuronal specification is often seen as a multistep process: earlier regulators confer broad neuronal identity and are followed by combinatorial codes specifying neuronal properties unique to specific subtypes. however, it is still unclear whether early regulators are re-deployed in subtype-specific combinatorial codes, and whether early patterning events act to restrict the developmental potential of postmitotic cells. here, we use the differential peptidergic fate of two lineage-related peptidergic neurons in the drosophila ventral nerve cord to show how, in a feedforward mechanism, earlier determinants become critical players in later combinatorial codes. amongst the progeny of neuroblast 5–6 are two peptidergic neurons: one expresses fmrfamide and the other one expresses nplp1 and the dopamine receptor dopr. we show the hlh gene collier functions at three different levels to progressively restrict neuronal identity in the 5–6 lineage. at the final step, collier is the critical combinatorial factor that differentiates two partially overlapping combinatorial codes that define fmrfamide versus nplp1/dopr identity. misexpression experiments reveal that both codes can activate neuropeptide gene expression in vast numbers of neurons. despite their partially overlapping composition, we find that the codes are remarkably specific, with each code activating only the proper neuropeptide gene. these results indicate that a limited number of regulators may constitute a potent combinatorial code that dictates unique neuronal cell fate, and that such codes show a surprising disregard for many global instructive cues.
continuous-variable entanglement in a two-mode three-level cascade laser with a parametric amplifier we consider a two-photon correlated emission laser as a source of an entangled radiation with a large number of photons in each mode. the system consists of three-level atomic schemes inside a doubly resonant cavity. we study the dynamics of this system in the presence of cavity losses, concluding that the creation of entangled states with photon numbers up to tens of thousands seems achievable.
coding and non-coding variants in the shox2 gene in patients with early-onset atrial fibrillation atrial fibrillation (af) is the most common arrhythmia and is associated with increased morbidity. as the population ages and the prevalence of af continues to rise, the socioeconomic consequences of af will become increasingly burdensome. although there are well-defined clinical risk factors for af, a significant heritable component is also recognized. to identify the molecular basis for the heritability of af, investigators have used a combination of classical mendelian genetics, candidate gene screening, and genome-wide association studies. however, these avenues have, as yet, failed to define the majority of the heritability of af. the goal of this review is to describe the results from both candidate gene and genome-wide studies, as well as to outline potential future avenues for creating a more complete understanding of af genetics. ultimately, a more comprehensive view of the genetic underpinnings for af will lead to the identification of novel molecular pathways and improved risk prediction of this complex arrhythmia.
aids care: psychological and socio-medical aspects of aids/hiv objectives:to explore factors associated with early sex work initiation and model the independent effect of early initiation on hiv infection and prostitution arrests among adult sex workers (sws). design:baseline data (2010–2011) were drawn from a cohort of sws who exchanged sex for money within the last month and were recruited through time location sampling in vancouver, canada. analyses were restricted to adults ≥18 years old. methods:sws completed a questionnaire and hiv/sexually transmitted infection testing. using multivariate logistic regression, we identified associations with early sex work initiation (<18 years old) and constructed confounder models examining the independent effect of early initiation on hiv and prostitution arrests among adult sws. results:of 508 sws, 193 (38.0%) reported early sex work initiation, with 78.53% primarily street-involved sws and 21.46% off-street sws. hiv prevalence was 11.22%, which was 19.69% among early initiates. early initiates were more likely to be canadian born [adjusted odds ratio (aor): 6.8, 95% confidence interval (ci): 2.42 to 19.02], inject drugs (aor: 1.6, 95% ci: 1.0 to 2.5), and to have worked for a manager (aor: 2.22, 95% ci: 1.3 to 3.6) or been coerced into sex work (aor: 2.3, 95% ci: 1.14 to 4.44). early initiation retained an independent effect on increased risk of hiv infection (aor: 2.5, 95% ci: 1.3 to 3.2) and prostitution arrests (aor: 2.0, 95% ci: 1.3 to 3.2). conclusions:adolescent sex work initiation is concentrated among marginalized, drug, and street-involved sws. early initiation holds an independent increased effect on hiv infection and criminalization of adult sws. findings suggest the need for evidence-based approaches to reduce harm among adult and youth sws.
frugivore choice and escape from pre-dispersal seed predators: the case of dialium guianense and two sympatric primate species in southern mexico here we review all published articles and book chapters, as well as unpublished theses and data of ateles geoffroyi diet to (1) summarize the literature; (2) synthesize general feeding patterns; (3) document plant taxonomic similarity in diet across study sites; and (4) suggest directions for future research and conservation priorities. we found 22 samples from five countries: mexico, guatemala, el salvador, costa rica and panama. tropical wet forest is the most studied habitat (n=13 samples), followed by tropical dry forest (6) and tropical moist forest (3). most samples have been carried out in large protected forests. in spite of showing an overall high dietetic diversity (364 species, 76 families), a. geoffroyi concentrated the majority of feeding time on a few species in the families moraceae and fabaceae. at all study sites fruits were the most common food item in the diet followed by leaves. furthermore, a greater variety of food items and less fruit were consumed in forest fragments. these findings suggest that fruit shortage in fragments results in primates using foods of presumably lower energetic content such as leaves. similarity in diet was higher among groups geographically closer to each other than among distant groups, showing that the floristic and phenological characteristics of the forest can influence diet composition. we conclude that several years of data are required to fully describe the dietary list of a. geoffroyi at any one site, as studies of the same group over different years shared as little as 56% of species. as most populations of a. geoffroyi live in highly fragmented landscapes, it is crucial to carry out studies in these areas to evaluate (1) changes in diet and activity patterns that may negatively affect survival; and (2) habitat attributes that may favor their persistence in altered landscapes. am. j. primatol. 71:8–20, 2009. © 2008 wiley‐liss, inc.
aging adults and seasonal influenza: does the vitamin d status (h)arm the body? numerous reports have linked extremity muscle strength with mortality but the mechanism underlying this association is not known. we used data from 960 older persons without dementia participating in the rush memory and aging project to test two sequential hypotheses: first, that extremity muscle strength is a surrogate for respiratory muscle strength, and second, that the association of respiratory muscle strength with mortality is mediated by pulmonary function. in a series of proportional hazards models, we first demonstrated that the association of extremity muscle strength with mortality was no longer significant after including a term for respiratory muscle strength, controlling for age, sex, education, and body mass index. next, the association of respiratory muscle strength with mortality was attenuated by more than 50% and no longer significant after including a term for pulmonary function. the findings were unchanged after controlling for cognitive function, parkinsonian signs, physical frailty, balance, physical activity, possible copd, use of pulmonary medications, vascular risk factors including smoking, chronic vascular diseases, musculoskeletal joint pain, and history of falls. overall, these findings suggest that pulmonary function may partially account for the association of muscle strength and mortality.
tmem74 promotes tumor cell survival by inducing autophagy via interactions with atg16l1 and atg9a rapid membrane expansion is the key to autophagosome formation during nutrient starvation. in this issue, yamamoto et al. (2012. j. cell biol. http://dx.doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201202061) now provide a mechanism for vesicle-mediated initiation of autophagosome biogenesis. they show that atg9 vesicles, produced de novo during starvation, are ∼30–60 nm in size and contain ∼30 molecules of atg9. these vesicles assemble to form an autophagosome, and subsequently, the atg9 embedded in the outer membrane is recycled to avoid degradation.
the reduction in maize leaf growth under mild drought affects the transition between cell division and cell expansion and cannot be restored by elevated gibberellic acid levels modulated chlorophyll fluorescence, rapid fluorescence induction kinetics and the polyphasic fluorescence transients (ojip) were used to evaluate psii photochemistry in wheat plants exposed to water stress and/or heat stress (25-45°c). water stress showed no effects on the maximal quantum yield of psii photochemistry (f v /f m ), the rapid fluorescence induction kinetics, and the polyphasic fluorescence transients in dark-adapted leaves, indicating that water stress had no effects on the primary photochemistry of psii. however, in light-adapted leaves, water stress reduced the efficiency of excitation energycapture by open psii reaction centres (f' v /f' m ) and the quantum yield of psii electron transport (φ psii ), increased the non-photochemical quenching (q n ) and showed no effects on the photochemical quenching (q p ). this suggests that water stress modified the psii photochemistry in the light-adapted leaves and such modifications may be a mechanism to down-regulate the photosynthetic electron transport to match a decreased co 2 assimilation. in addition, water stress also modified the responses of psii to heat stress. when temperature was above 35 °c, thermostability of psii was strongly enhanced in water-stressed leaves, which was reflected in a less decrease in f v /f m , q p , f' v /f' m , and φ psii in water-stressed leaves than in well-watered leaves. there were no significant variations in the above fluorescence parameters between moderately and severely water-stressed plants, indicating that the moderate water stress treatment caused the same effects on thermostability of psii as the severe treatment. it was found that increased thermostability of psii may be associated with an improvement of resistance of the o 2 -evolving complex and the reaction centres in water-stressed plants to high temperature.
ho x observations over west africa during amma: impact of isoprene and no x the measurement of oh reactivity, the inverse of the oh lifetime, provides a powerful tool to investigate atmospheric photochemistry. a new airborne oh reactivity instrument was designed and deployed for the first time on the nasa dc-8 aircraft during the second phase of inter- continental chemical transport experiment-b (intex-b) campaign, which was focused on the asian pollution out- flow over pacific ocean and was based in hawaii and alaska. the oh reactivity was measured by adding oh, generated by photolyzing water vapor with 185 nm uv light in a moveable wand, to the flow of ambient air in a flow tube and mea- suring the oh signal with laser induced fluorescence. as the wand was pulled back away from the oh detector, the oh signal decay was recorded; the slope of 1ln(signal)/1 time was the oh reactivity. the overall absolute uncer- tainty at the 2 confidence levels is about 1 s 1 at low al- titudes (for decay about 6 s 1 ), and 0.7 s 1 at high altitudes (for decay about 2 s 1 ). from the median vertical profile obtained in the second phase of intex-b, the measured oh reactivity (4.0±1.0 s 1 ) is higher than the oh reactiv-
reciprocal regulation of microrna-99a and insulin-like growth factor i receptor signaling in oral squamous cell carcinoma cells background: microrna-99a markedly decreases in hcc. results: microrna-99a expression correlates with hcc patients' survival, and microrna-99a restoration suppresses hcc growth in vitro and in vivo by targeting igf-1r and mtor. conclusions: microrna-99a could be prognosis predictor and tumor suppressor for hcc. significance: reveal the important role of microrna-99a in hcc development and provide prognosis predictor and therapeutic approach for hcc. in our in-depth analysis carried out by the illumina solexa massive parallel signature sequencing, microrna-99a (mir-99a) was found to be the sixth abundant microrna in the mirnome of normal human liver but was markedly down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). compelling evidence has suggested the important roles of micrornas in hcc development. however, the biological function of mir-99a deregulation in hcc remains unknown. in this study, we found that mir-99a was remarkably decreased in hcc tissues and cell lines. importantly, lower mir-99a expression in hcc tissues significantly correlated with shorter survival of hcc patients, and mir-99a was identified to be an independent predictor for the prognosis of hcc patients. furthermore, restoration of mir-99a dramatically suppressed hcc cell growth in vitro by inducing the g1 phase cell cycle arrest. intratumoral injection of cholesterol-conjugated mir-99a mimics significantly inhibited tumor growth and reduced the α-fetoprotein level in hcc-bearing nude mice. insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (igf-1r) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) were further characterized as the direct targets of mir-99a. furthermore, protein levels of igf-1r and mtor were found to be inversely correlated with mir-99a expression in hcc tissues. mir-99a mimics inhibited igf-1r and mtor pathways and subsequently suppressed expression of cell cycle-related proteins, including cyclin d1 in hcc cells. conclusively, mir-99a expression was frequently down-regulated in hcc tissues and correlates with the prognosis of hcc patients, thus proposing mir-99a as a prospective prognosis predictor of hcc. mir-99a suppresses hcc growth by inducing cell cycle arrest, suggesting mir-99a as potential tumor suppressor for hcc therapeutics.
do eportfolios contribute to learners’ reflective thinking activities? : a preliminary study of nursing staff users an information-exchange virtual community (vc) is an it-supported virtual space that is composed of a group of people for accessing, sharing and disseminating topic-related experiences and knowledge through communication and social interaction 36,43]. with the increasing number of vcs and low switching cost, it is challenging to retain existing users and encourage their continued participation. by integrating the is post-adoption research and is success model, we propose a research framework to investigate vc users' continuance intention from a quality perspective. based on a field survey, we find that information and system quality directly affect perceived individual benefits and user satisfaction, which ultimately determine user continuance intention to consume and to provide information. furthermore, by modeling information quality and system quality as multifaceted constructs, our results reveal key quality concerns in information-exchange vcs. implications for vc design and management are also discussed.
fate decision between group 3 innate lymphoid and conventional nk cell lineages by notch signaling in human circulating hematopoietic progenitors innate lymphoid cells (ilcs) are a family of developmentally related cells that are involved in immunity and in tissue development and remodelling. recent research has identified several distinct members of this family. confusingly, many different names have been used to characterize these newly identified ilc subsets. here, we propose that ilcs should be categorized into three groups based on the cytokines that they can produce and the transcription factors that regulate their development and function.
myocardial infarction and mortality following joint surgery in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a retrospective cohort study state and regional efforts to assess the quality of health care often start with administrative data, which are a by-product of administering health services, enrolling members into health insurance plans, and reimbursing for health care services. by definition, administrative data were never intended for use in quality assessment. as a result, clinicians often dismiss these data, arguing that the information cannot be trusted. nonetheless, with detailed clinical information buried deep within paper medical records and thus expensive to extract, administrative data possess important virtues. they are readily available; are inexpensive to acquire; are computer readable; and typically encompass entire regional populations or large, well-defined subpopulations. in the health policy community, hopes for administrative data were initially high. beginning in the early 1970s, administrative data quantified startling practice variations across small geographic areas [1, 2]. in the 1980s, administrative databases became a mainstay of research on the outcomes of care [3, 4]. in 1989, legislation that created the agency for health care policy and research (ahcpr) stipulated the use of claims data in determining the outcomes, effectiveness, and appropriateness of different therapies (public law 101-239, section 1142[c]). five years later, however, the office of technology assessment offered a stinging appraisal: contrary to the expectations expressed in the legislation establishing ahcpr administrative databases generally have not proved useful in answering questions about the comparative effectiveness of alternative medical treatments [5]. the costs of acquiring detailed clinical information, however, often force concessions in the real world. for example, in 1990, california's assembly debated new requirements for reporting clinical data to evaluate hospital quality [6]. when estimated annual costs for data collection were $61 million, fiscal reality intervened. the legislature mandated the creation of quality measures that used california's existing administrative database. thus, widespread quality assessment typically demands a tradeoff-the credibility of clinical data versus the expense and feasibility of data collection. can administrative data produce useful judgments about the quality of health care? defining quality what is quality? for decades, physicians protested that defining health care quality was impossible. today, however, experts claim that rigorous quality measures can systematically assess care across groups of patients [7, 8]. nonetheless, consensus about specific methods for measuring quality remains elusive. different conceptual frameworks for defining quality stress different dimensions of health care delivery. donabedian's classic framework [9] delineated three dimensions: 1) structure, or the characteristics of a health care setting [for example, the physical plant, available technology, staffing patterns, and credentialing procedures]; 2) process, or what is done to patients; and 3) outcomes, or how patients do after health care interventions. the three dimensions are intertwined, but their relative utility depends on context. few links between processes and outcomes are backed by solid evidence from well-controlled studies, and outcomes that are not linked to specific medical practices provide little guidance for developing quality-improvement strategies [10]. in addition, comparing outcomes across groups frequently requires adjustment for patient risk and the recognition that some patients are sicker than others [11]. other important dimensions emerge when a process splits into two components: technical quality and interpersonal quality (for example, communication, caring, and respect for patient preferences). another process question involves the appropriateness of services: errors of omission (failing to do necessary things) and errors of commission (doing unnecessary things). both errors can be related to another important dimension of quality: access to health care. in errors of omission, access may be impeded; in errors of commission, access may be too easy or inducements to perform procedures too great. in today's environment, determining who (or what) is accountable for observed quality is as important as measuring quality. this requires defining a unit of analysis: quality for whom? potential units of analysis include individual patients, patients grouped by providers, or populations defined by region or an important characteristic (for example, the insurer or patient age). methods for measuring quality across populations differ from those that scrutinize quality for individual patients. given these multidimensional perspectives, a single response may be insufficient to judge whether administrative data can assess health care quality. as discussed in the following sections, administrative data may capture some dimensions of quality and units of observation better than others. content of administrative databases the three major producers of administrative databases are the federal government (including the health care financing administration [hcfa], which administers medicare and oversees medicaid; the department of defense; and the department of veterans affairs), state governments, and private insurers [3, 4, 12-19]. although administrative files initially concentrated on information from acute care hospitals, information is increasingly compiled from outpatient, long-term care, home health, and hospice programs. most administrative files explicitly aim to minimize data collection. their source documents (for example, claim forms) contain the minimum amount of information required to perform the relevant administrative function (for example, to verify and pay the claims). in this article, i focus on hospital-derived data (such as that obtained from discharge abstracts), but many of the issues examined apply to other care settings. their clinical content delimits the potential of databases to measure the quality of health care. administrative sources always contain routine demographic data (table 1). additional clinical information includes diagnosis codes (based on the international classification of diseases, ninth revision, clinical modification [icd-9-cm]) and procedure codes. hospitals report procedures using the icd-9-cm codes, but physicians generally use codes from the american medical association's current procedural terminology. the two coding systems do not readily link, hindering comparisons between hospital- and physician-generated data. table 1. contents of the uniform hospital discharge data set the icd-9-cm contains codes for many conditions that are technically not diseases (table 2). given this diversity, creatively combining icd-9-cm codes produces snapshots of clinical scenarios. for example, data selected from the 1994 discharge abstract of a man in a california hospital (table 3) suggest the following scenario: a 62-year-old white man with a history of chronic renal failure that required hemodialysis and type 2 diabetes with retinopathy was admitted with the mallory-weis syndrome. blood loss from an esophageal tear may have caused orthostatic hypotension. during the 9-day hospitalization, the patient was also treated for klebsiella pneumonia. table 2. examples of information contained in icd-9-cm codes* table 3. discharge abstract information for a patient admitted to a california hospital in 1994* this diversity of icd-9-cm codes is used by administrative data-based severity measures [20-22] aiming to compare risk-adjusted patient outcomes across hospitals. for example, disease staging rates patients with pneumonia as having more severe disease if the discharge abstract also contains codes for sepsis. attributes of administrative data administrative files contain limited clinical insight to inform quality assessment. administrative data cannot elucidate the interpersonal quality of care, evaluate the technical quality of processes of care, determine most errors of omission or commission, or assess the appropriateness of care. some exceptions to these negative judgments do exist. for example, with longitudinal person-level data, one could detect failures to immunize children (errors of omission)-if all immunizations were coded properly, which is unlikely. certain icd-9-cm procedure codes prompt concerns about technical quality (for example, 39.41, control of hemorrhage after vascular surgery, and 54.12, reopening of recent laparotomy site), but the specificity of the codes is suspect. nonetheless, administrative data are widely used to produce hospital report cards that primarily compare in-hospital mortality rates. the mechanics are easy. for example, in massachusetts, reporters for the boston globe purchased the state's database of hospital discharge abstracts, conducted analyses, and published a report card on hospital mortality. the report card was explicitly intended to provide insight into the quality of health care [23]. are quality assessments based on administrative data valid? as donabedian observed [9], a major aspect of validity has to do with the accuracy of the data. the institute of medicine's committee on regional health data networks made the reliability and validity of data an absolute requirement that had to be satisfied before public dissemination of derived quality measures [12]: the public interest is materially served when society is given as much information on costs, quality, and value for health care dollar expended as can be given accurately . public disclosure is acceptable only when it: (1) involves information and analytic results that come from studies that have been well conducted, (2) is based on data that can be shown to be reliable and valid for the purposes intended, and (3) is accompanied by appropriate educational material. what, therefore, are the important attributes of administrative data? data quality like quality of car
aerosol composition and sources in the central arctic ocean during ascos increases in anthropogenic aerosols in the atmosphere tend to increase the reflectance of solar (shortwave) radiation from water clouds, which can lead to lower surface temperatures. here an opposing effect whereby aerosols increase the longwave emissivity of thin clouds that adds to the warming of the earth’s surface, is discussed. the latter effect may be particularly important in the arctic, especially during the winter and early spring when thin stratus clouds are ubiquitous, relatively high levels of anthropogenic pollution are common, and there is little solar radiation.
interaction design and evaluation of mobile guides for the museum visit: a case study in multimedia and mobile augmented reality. (etude d'interaction et evaluation de guides portables multimédia pour la visite culturelle: des multimédia à la réalité augmentée mobile) mobivisit (former mobiguide) is the combination of an indoor and outdoor portable tourist guide. the first experimentations took place in lyon, in 2003, on pocket pcs for both the indoor and outdoor guide, on the occasion of a project undertaken by france telecom research and development division. today, the outdoor version of mobivisit is commercialized both for pocket pcs and mobile phones. the goal in lyon was to do a usability test with a multimedia tourist guide, in the city and the surrounding region as well as in the museum of fine arts. much emphasis was placed on examining the continuity of usage between indoor and outdoor cultural settings. during the first three months of the experimentations, approximately 500 tourists borrowed the multimedia guide from the main lyon tourist information office situated on bellecour square to test it free of charge, for a period of one to three days. a second experimentation took place in the museum, with three different target groups: tourists, students and “friends of the museum”, namely senior citizen visitors. the objective of this publication is to share our experience acquired from the mobivisit project, particularly regarding aspects such as barriers in the production of handheld multimedia guides, the means demanded, the various validation tests carried out, the technologies used at the time of production, as well as the results obtained. through this project we also had the opportunity to compare the indoor and the outdoor guide, in relation to the business models, the technologies and the tools developed.
fracture strength of roots instrumented with three different single file systems in curved root canals as compared with continuous rotary systems, reciprocating motion is believed to increase the fatigue resistance of niti instruments. we compared the cyclic fatigue and torsional resistance of reciprocating single-file systems and continuous rotary instrumentation systems in simulated root canals. eighty instruments from the protaper universal, waveone, mtwo, and reciproc systems (n = 20) were submitted to dynamic bending testing in stainless-steel simulated curved canals. axial displacement of the simulated canals was performed with half of the instruments (n = 10), with back-and-forth movements in a range of 1.5 mm. time until fracture was recorded, and the number of cycles until instrument fracture was calculated. cyclic fatigue resistance was greater for reciprocating systems than for rotary systems (p < 0.05). instruments from the reciproc and waveone systems significantly differed only when axial displacement occurred (p < 0.05). instruments of the protaper universal and mtwo systems did not significantly differ (p > 0.05). cyclic fatigue and torsional resistance were greater for reciprocating systems than for continuous rotary systems, irrespective of axial displacement.
virtual direction routing for overlay networks hash tables - which map "keys" onto "values" - are an essential building block in modern software systems. we believe a similar functionality would be equally valuable to large distributed systems. in this paper, we introduce the concept of a content-addressable network (can) as a distributed infrastructure that provides hash table-like functionality on internet-like scales. the can is scalable, fault-tolerant and completely self-organizing, and we demonstrate its scalability, robustness and low-latency properties through simulation.
combination of bcg and interferon intravesical immunotherapy: an update with the introduction of bcg, intravesical instillation of immunotherapeutic agents has become a mainstay of therapy in the treatment of superficial bladder cancer. interferon is capable of inducing a non-specific cellular and humoral immune response towards tumor cells. it has shown promise in reducing the recurrence and progression rates of superficial bladder cancer. in contrast to bcg, intravesical interferon is associated with minimal side effects and a very low dropout rate. current research has focused on the use of interferon in combination with immunotherapeutic and cytotoxic drugs.
marine microbial diversity studied via 16s rrna sequences: cloning results from coastal waters and counting of native archaea with fluorescent single cell probes the pcr is used widely for the study of rrna genes amplified from mixed microbial populations. these studies resemble quantitative applications of pcr in that the templates are mixtures of homologs and the relative abundance of amplicons is thought to provide some measure of the gene ratios in the starting mixture. although such studies have established the presence of novel rrna genes in many natural ecosystems, inferences about gene abundance have been limited by uncertainties about the relative efficiency of gene amplification in the pcr. to address this question, three rrna gene standards were prepared by pcr, mixed in known proportions, and amplified a second time by using primer pairs in which one primer was labeled with a fluorescent nucleotide derivative. the pcr products were digested with restriction endonucleases, and the frequencies of genes in the products were determined by electrophoresis on an applied biosystems 373a automated dna sequencer in genescan mode. mixtures of two templates amplified with the 519f-1406r primer pair yielded products in the predicted proportions. a second primer pair (27f-338r) resulted in strong bias towards 1:1 mixtures of genes in final products, regardless of the initial proportions of the templates. this bias was strongly dependent on the number of cycles of replication. the results fit a kinetic model in which the reannealing of genes progressively inhibits the formation of template-primer hybrids.
measurement of individualised quality of life amongst young people with indicated personality disorder during emerging adulthood using the seiqol-dw regression methods were used to select and score 12 items from the medical outcomes study 36-item short-form health survey (sf-36) to reproduce the physical component summary and mental component summary scales in the general us population (n=2,333). the resulting 12-item short-form (sf-12) achieved multiple r squares of 0.911 and 0.918 in predictions of the sf-36 physical component summary and sf-36 mental component summary scores, respectively. scoring algorithms from the general population used to score 12-item versions of the two components (physical components summary and mental component summary) achieved r squares of 0.905 with the sf-36 physical component summary and 0.938 with sf-36 mental component summary when cross-validated in the medical outcomes study. test-retest (2-week)correlations of 0.89 and 0.76 were observed for the 12-item physical component summary and the 12-item mental component summary, respectively, in the general us population (n=232). twenty cross-sectional and longitudinal tests of empirical validity previously published for the 36-item short-form scales and summary measures were replicated for the 12-item physical component summary and the 12-item mental component summary, including comparisons between patient groups known to differ or to change in terms of the presence and seriousness of physical and mental conditions, acute symptoms, age and aging, self-reported 1-year changes in health, and recovery for depression. in 14 validity tests involving physical criteria, relative validity estimates for the 12-item physical component summary ranged from 0.43 to 0.93 (median=0.67) in comparison with the best 36-item short-form scale. relative validity estimates for the 12-item mental component summary in 6 tests involving mental criteria ranged from 0.60 to 107 (median=0.97) in relation to the best 36-item short-form scale. average scores for the 2 summary measures, and those for most scales in the 8-scale profile based on the 12-item short-form, closely mirrored those for the 36-item short-form, although standard errors were nearly always larger for the 12-item short-form.
physical constraints on the evolution of cooperation a model is presented to account for the natural selection of what is termed reciprocally altruistic behavior. the model shows how selection can operate against the cheater (non-reciprocator) in the system. three instances of altruistic behavior are discussed, the evolution of which the model can explain: (1) behavior involved in cleaning symbioses; (2) warning cries in birds; and (3) human reciprocal altruism. regarding human reciprocal altruism, it is shown that the details of the psychological system that regulates this altruism can be explained by the model. specifically, friendship, dislike, moralistic aggression, gratitude, sympathy, trust, suspicion, trustworthiness, aspects of guilt, and some forms of dishonesty and hypocrisy can be explained as important adaptations to regulate the altruistic system. each individual human is seen as possessing altruistic and cheating tendencies, the expression of which is sensitive to developmental variables that were selected to set the tendencies at a balance appropriate to the local social and ecological environment.
effects of mirthful laughter on growth hormone, igf-1 and substance p in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. stunted growth is a major complication of chronic inflammation and recurrent infections in children. systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by markedly elevated circulating levels of il-6 and stunted growth. in this study we found that nse/hil-6 transgenic mouse lines expressing high levels of circulating il-6 since early after birth presented a reduced growth rate that led to mice 50-70% the size of nontransgenic littermates. administration of a monoclonal antibody to the murine il-6 receptor partially reverted the growth defect. in nse/hil-6 transgenic mice, circulating igf-i levels were significantly lower than those of nontransgenic littermates; on the contrary, the distribution of growth hormone pituitary cells, as well as circulating growth hormone levels, were normal. treatment of nontransgenic mice of the same strain with il-6 resulted in a significant decrease in igf-i levels. moreover, in patients with systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, circulating il-6 levels were negatively correlated with igf-i levels. our findings suggest that il-6-mediated decrease in igf-i production represents a major mechanism by which chronic inflammation affects growth.
use of fiber and fuzz mutants to detect qtl for yield components, seed, and fiber traits of upland cotton a genetic linkage map of chromosome 6 was constructed by using 270 recombinant inbred lines originated from an upland cotton cross (yumian 1 × t586) f2 population. the genetic map included one morphological (t1) and 18 ssr loci, covering 96.2 cm with an average distance of 5.34 cm between two markers. based on composite interval mapping (cim), qtl(s) affecting lint percentage, fiber length, fiber length uniformity, fiber strength and spiny bollworm resistance (earias spp.) were identified in the t1 locus region on chromosome 6. the allele(s) originating from t586 of qtls controlling lint percentage increased the trait phenotypic value while the alleles originating from yumian 1 of qtls affecting fiber length, fiber length uniformity, fiber strength and spiny bollworm resistance increased the trait phenotypic value.
deafferentation-based pathophysiological differences in phantom sound: tinnitus with and without hearing loss background different mechanisms have been proposed to be involved in tinnitus generation, among them reduced lateral inhibition and homeostatic plasticity. on a perceptual level these different mechanisms should be reflected by the relationship between the individual audiometric slope and the perceived tinnitus pitch. whereas some studies found the tinnitus pitch corresponding to the maximum hearing loss, others stressed the relevance of the edge frequency. this study investigates the relationship between tinnitus pitch and audiometric slope in a large sample. methodology this retrospective observational study analyzed 286 patients. the matched tinnitus pitch was compared to the frequency of maximum hearing loss and the edge of the audiogram (steepest hearing loss) by t-tests and correlation coefficients. these analyses were performed for the whole group and for sub-groups (uni- vs. bilateral (117 vs. 338 ears), pure-tone vs. narrow-band (340 vs. 115 ears), and low and high audiometric slope (114 vs. 113 ears)). findings for the right ear, tinnitus pitch was in the same range and correlated significantly with the frequency of maximum hearing loss, but differed from and did not correlate with the edge frequency. for the left ear, similar results were found but the correlation between tinnitus pitch and maximum hearing loss did not reach significance. sub-group analyses (bi- and unilateral, tinnitus character, slope steepness) revealed identical results except for the sub-group with high audiometric slope which revealed a higher frequency of maximum hearing loss as compared to the tinnitus pitch. conclusion the study-results confirm a relationship between tinnitus pitch and maximum hearing loss but not to the edge frequency, suggesting that tinnitus is rather a fill-in-phenomenon resulting from homeostatic mechanisms, than the result of deficient lateral inhibition. sub-group analyses suggest that audiometric steepness and the side of affected ear affect this relationship. future studies should control for these potential confounding factors.
the association between systemic glucocorticoid therapy and the risk of infection in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: systematic review and meta-analyses objective prosthetic joint infection is one of the most dreaded complications after total joint arthroplasty, a common procedure in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra). we conducted a study to evaluate potential risk factors of prosthetic joint infection and to clarify if ra is an independent predictor of this complication.   methods this study included all patients with ra who underwent total hip or knee replacement at the mayo clinic rochester between january 1996 and june 2004. the association of potential risk factors with prosthetic joint infection was examined using cox models. a matched cohort of patients with osteoarthritis (oa) was assembled to determine whether ra is an independent risk factor for prosthetic joint infection.   results we identified 462 patients with ra who underwent a total of 657 hip or knee replacements. overall, 23 (3.7%) joint arthroplasties were complicated by an infection during a mean +/- sd followup of 4.3 +/- 2.4 years. revision arthroplasty (hazard ratio [hr] 2.99, 95% confidence interval [95% ci] 1.02-8.75) and a previous prosthetic joint infection of the replaced joint (hr 5.49, 95% ci 1.87-16.14) were significant predictors of postoperative prosthetic joint infection. comparison of ra patients with a matched cohort of oa patients identified an increased risk of prosthetic joint infections (hr 4.08, 95% ci 1.35-12.33) in patients with ra.   conclusion patients with ra who undergo total hip or knee replacement are at increased risk of prosthetic joint infection, which is further increased in the setting of revision arthroplasty and a previous prosthetic joint infection. these findings highlight the importance of perioperative prophylactic measures and vigilance during the postoperative period.
conserved generation of short products at pirna loci in plants and mammals, small rnas indirectly mediate epigenetic inheritance by specifying cytosine methylation. we found that small rnas themselves serve as vectors for epigenetic information. crosses between drosophila strains that differ in the presence of a particular transposon can produce sterile progeny, a phenomenon called hybrid dysgenesis. this phenotype manifests itself only if the transposon is paternally inherited, suggesting maternal transmission of a factor that maintains fertility. in both p- and i-element–mediated hybrid dysgenesis models, daughters show a markedly different content of piwi-interacting rnas (pirnas) targeting each element, depending on their parents of origin. such differences persist from fertilization through adulthood. this indicates that maternally deposited pirnas are important for mounting an effective silencing response and that a lack of maternal pirna inheritance underlies hybrid dysgenesis.
preparation and characterization of chitin benzoic acid esters trifluoroacetic anhydride is an effective promoter for the preparation of chitin single- and mixed-acid esters. complete dissolution is achieved within 30 min when powdered chitin is heated at 70 degrees c in a mixed solution of carboxylic acid(s) and trifluoroacetic anhydride. chitin esters prepared are chitin acetate, chitin butyrate, chitin hexanoate and chitin octanoate, chitin co-acetate/butyrate, chitin co-acetate/hexanoate, chitin co-acetate/octanoate, chitin co-acetate/palmitate, each from a solution of the respective reactants. the products have degrees of o-acyl substitution in a range of ds 1-2 depending on the nature of acyl group, as analyzed by gas-liquid and high-pressure liquid chromatography. acetic acid as a mutual component for the mixed-acid esters increases the total degree of substitution, and the acetyl substitution is close to the relative distribution in the reaction mixture for chitin co-acetate/butyrate. it is favored over hexanoate, octanoate, and palmitate. the parent molecules, as calculated by the composition of the chitin esters and their molecular weights by light-scattering spectroscopy, are 30 kda for the smallest and 150-151 kda for the largest. films of these chitin derivatives when cast from solution are strong and flexible with limited extensibility. by dynamic mechanical analysis of the ester film, it was found that both the glass transition temperature (t(g)) and the tensile modulus (e' at 25 degrees c) are highest for chitin acetate (218 degrees c and 5.8 gpa), and lowest for chitin octanoate (182 degrees c and 1.5 gpa). for the other esters, these values lie between the above-cited values, where the t(g) and the e' decrease with an increase in the chain length of the acyl constituent.
targeting mapk pathway in melanoma therapy the mitogen activated protein kinase (mapk) pathway plays a key role in melanoma development making it an important therapeutic target. in normal cells, the tightly regulated pathway relays extracellular signals from cell membrane to nucleus via a cascade of phosphorylation events. in melanomas, dysregulation of the mapk pathway occurs frequently due to activating mutations in the b-raf and ras genes or other genetic or epigenetic modifications, leading to increased signaling activity promoting cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, migration, survival and angiogenesis. however, identification of ideal pathway member to therapeutically target for maximal clinical benefit to melanoma patients remains a challenge. this review provides an overview of the obstacles faced targeting the mapk pathway and why certain therapeutic approaches succeed while others fail. the review summarizes the roles played by the proteins, therapeutic potential and the drugs available to target each member of the pathway as well as concerns related to each. potential for targeting multiple points and inhibiting other pathways along with mapk inhibition for optimal efficacy are discussed along with explanations for development of drug resistance, which includes discussions related to cross-talk between pathways, raf kinase isoform switching and phosphatase deregulation. finally, the use of nanotechnology is reviewed as an approach to target the mapk pathway using both genetic and pharmacological agents simultaneously targeting multiple points in the pathway or in combination with other cascades.
physical constraints on the evolution of cooperation a model is presented to account for the natural selection of what is termed reciprocally altruistic behavior. the model shows how selection can operate against the cheater (non-reciprocator) in the system. three instances of altruistic behavior are discussed, the evolution of which the model can explain: (1) behavior involved in cleaning symbioses; (2) warning cries in birds; and (3) human reciprocal altruism. regarding human reciprocal altruism, it is shown that the details of the psychological system that regulates this altruism can be explained by the model. specifically, friendship, dislike, moralistic aggression, gratitude, sympathy, trust, suspicion, trustworthiness, aspects of guilt, and some forms of dishonesty and hypocrisy can be explained as important adaptations to regulate the altruistic system. each individual human is seen as possessing altruistic and cheating tendencies, the expression of which is sensitive to developmental variables that were selected to set the tendencies at a balance appropriate to the local social and ecological environment.
network-driven proteogenomics unveils an aging-related imbalance in the olfactory iκbα-nfκb p65 complex functionality in tg2576 alzheimer’s disease mouse model mice that overexpress the human mutant amyloid precursor protein (happ) show learning deficits, but the apparent lack of a relationship between these deficits and the progressive β-amyloid plaque formation that the happ mice display is puzzling. in the water maze, happ mice are impaired before and after amyloid plaque deposition. here we show, using a new water-maze training protocol, that pdapp mice also exhibit a separate age-related deficit in learning a series of spatial locations. this impairment correlates with β-amyloid plaque burden and is shown in both cross-sectional and longitudinal experimental designs. cued navigation and object-recognition memory are normal. these findings indicate that aβ overexpression and/or aβ plaques are associated with disturbed cognitive function and, importantly, suggest that some but not all forms of learning and memory are suitable behavioural assays of the progressive cognitive deficits associated with alzheimer's-disease-type pathologies.
chronic allopurinol treatment during the last trimester of pregnancy in sows: effects on low and normal birth weight offspring in experimental animal research, a short phylogenetic distance, i.e., high resemblance between the model species and the species to be modeled is expected to increase the relevance and generalizability of results obtained in the model species. the (mini)pig shows multiple advantageous characteristics that have led to an increase in the use of this species in studies modeling human medical issues, including neurobehavioral (dys)functions. for example, the cerebral cortex of pigs, unlike that of mice or rats, has cerebral convolutions (gyri and sulci) similar to the human neocortex. we expect that appropriately chosen pig models will yield results of high translational value. however, this claim still needs to be substantiated by research, and the area of pig research is still in its infancy. this chapter provides an overview of the pig as a model species for studying cognitive dysfunctions and neurobehavioral disorders and their treatment, along with a discussion of the pros and cons of various tests, as an aid to researchers considering the use of pigs as model animal species in biomedical research.
fatty acid handling protein expression in adipose tissue, fatty acid composition of adipose tissue and serum, and markers of insulin resistance the cellular basis of insulin resistance is still unknown; however, relationships have been demonstrated between insulin action in muscle and the fatty acid profile of the major membrane structural lipid (phospholipid). the present study aimed to further investigate the hypothesis that insulin action and adiposity are associated with changes in the structural lipid composition of the cell. in 52 adult male pima indians, insulin action (euglycemic clamp), percentage body fat (pfat; underwater weighing), and muscle phospholipid fatty acid composition (percutaneous biopsy of vastus lateralis) were determined. insulin action (high-dose clamp; mz) correlated with composite measures of membrane unsaturation (% c20-22 polyunsaturated fatty acids [r= 0.463, p < 0.001], unsaturation index [r= -0.369, p < 0.01]), a number of individual fatty acids and with delta5 desaturase activity (r= 0.451, p < 0.001). pfat (range 14-53%) correlated with a number of individual fatty acids and delta5 desaturase activity (r= -0.610, p < 0.0001). indices of elongase activity (r= -0.467, p < 0.001), and delta9 desaturase activity (r= 0.332, p < 0.05) were also related to pfat but not insulin action. the results demonstrate that delta5 desaturase activity is independently related to both insulin resistance and obesity. while determining the mechanisms underlying this relationship is important for future investigations, strategies aimed at restoring "normal" enzyme activities, and membrane unsaturation, may have therapeutic importance in the "syndromes of insulin resistance."
reliability/cost evaluation of a wind power delivery system this paper utilizes wasp, a state-of-the art computer model, to obtain optimal generation expansion plans for an electric utility in order to assess the impact of incorporating a wind energy conversion system into an electric utility generation expansion plan. the ieee reliability test system is used in the evaluations. the optimal plans satisfy given levels of reliability, in terms of loss of load probability and capacity reserve margin, and minimize the present worth of capital and operating costs minus a salvage value at the end of the planning horizon. the analyses were carried out with a 75 mw and a 150 mw wind energy conversion systems as expansion candidates and evaluating their impact on optimal mix of capacity for displacement, fuel savings and capital and operating costs over the 1981-2010 planning period. in this paper the wind turbine generators are modelled as multi- state units whose derated capacity states are caused by wind variability and random mechanical failure. as the results show, the wind energy conversion system has a significant effect on optimal mix of generation and construction timing of conventional units as well as reliability and capital and operating requirements.
size matters: genital allometry in an african mole-rat (family: bathyergidae) the interaction between functional and mechanistic approaches to sperm competition and between male and female perspectives are described and illustrated by a study of the zebra finch, taeniopygia guttata. sperm competition experiments in the laboratory show that last male sperm precedence occurs (as it does in many other taxa) although the mechanism is unknown (as in most other taxa). empirically-derived values were used to construct a mathematical model of sperm competition in the zebra finch. the model indicates that precedence occurs as a consequence of: (i) the temporal pattern of pair copulations; (ii) the rate at which sperm are lost from the female tract; and (iii) more sperm being transferred during extra-pair copulations than during pair copulations. the latter effect is a consequence of males seeking extra-pair copulations after their own pair copulation period has ended. the effect of sperm numbers on the pattern of sperm precedence may be further increased by: (i) extra-pair males increasing ejaculate size (sperm numbers) (for which there is no evidence); (ii) extra-pair males being of a better quality and transferring more sperm or better quality sperm (for which there is some evidence); and (iii) cryptic female choice. females eject over 99% of sperm following insemination; if they eject fewer sperm from males chosen as extra-pair copulation partners, the potential for cryptic female choice is considerable. however, this is still being investigated. the model also predicts the optimal time for an extra-pair copulation to occur (from either a male or female perspective). a comparison between the predicted and observed pattern suggests that the optimal timing of extra-pair copulations is constrained in both sexes.
the in vivo dynamic fatigue response of the spine to sudden loading in the sagittal plane: effects of pre-load and step input magnitude. objective to evaluate the impact of muscle pre-activation levels and load magnitude on the response of the trunk to loading conditions causing rapid flexion.   design eight male subjects were asked to maintain an upright standing posture while resisting the application of forward flexion moments produced by four different loading conditions consisting of combinations of two pre-loads (4% or 16% of the maximum extensor moment) and two added loads (12% or 24%). pre-loading was used to develop different initial levels of trunk muscle activity prior to the application of the added loads. of special interest were the two conditions that resulted in total final loads of 28%.   background cocontraction of the antagonistic and agonistic muscles of the trunk are required to provide stability during normal physiological loading conditions. in several in vivo studies, levels of trunk muscle cocontraction have been observed prior to the application of unexpected or sudden loads. forces from the abdominal muscles have been proposed to provide stability when extensor moments are generated. the response of trunk muscles to rapid flexor moments would provide further insight into the dynamic stability mechanisms of the spine.   methods measurements were made of the trunk extensor moments, angular displacement of the trunk and unilateral surface emg amplitudes of three abdominal and three trunk extensor muscles. values were recorded during the isometric pre-load and for the maximum magnitude of each variable in response to the added load.   results higher pre-loads resulted in lower flexion rotations of the spine and higher added loads caused larger rotations. with increasing magnitudes of final loads, a corresponding increase in trunk extensor moments and trunk muscle cocontraction was observed. the largest activations were observed in the lumbar erector spinae and thoracic erector spinae muscles, while smaller yet substantial emg activity was observed in the internal oblique and external oblique. a comparison of the 28% loading conditions showed an increased response of the trunk to the [4 + 24] loading condition (with lower initial trunk stiffness) when compared to the [16 + 12] loading condition.   conclusions pre-activation of trunk extensor muscles can serve to reduce the flexion displacements caused by rapid loading. the abdominal oblique muscles, especially external oblique, will rapidly increase their activation levels in response to rapid loading. these changes are more pronounced when pre-activation levels are low, resulting in lower initial trunk stiffness and spine compression force. it is proposed that these factors will ultimately affect spine stability and the risk of injury.   relevance the results of this study provide insight into several mechanisms involved in the dynamic stability of the spine. injuries can be caused by unexpected and rapid loading of the spine. a study of the mechanisms available to respond to such perturbations is important to an understanding of spine mechanics and the etiology of low back injury.
gnx-4728, a novel small molecule drug inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition, is therapeutic in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis alzheimer’s disease (ad), parkinson’s disease (pd) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) are the most common human adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases. they are characterized by prominent age-related neurodegeneration in selectively vulnerable neural systems. some forms of ad, pd, and als are inherited, and genes causing these diseases have been identified. nevertheless, the mechanisms of the neuronal cell death are unresolved. morphological, biochemical, genetic, as well as cell and animal model studies reveal that mitochondria could have roles in this neurodegeneration. the functions and properties of mitochondria might render subsets of selectively vulnerable neurons intrinsically susceptible to cellular aging and stress and overlying genetic variations, triggering neurodegeneration according to a cell death matrix theory. in ad, alterations in enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, oxidative damage, and mitochondrial binding of aβ and amyloid precursor protein have been reported. in pd, mutations in putative mitochondrial proteins have been identified and mitochondrial dna mutations have been found in neurons in the substantia nigra. in als, changes occur in mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes and mitochondrial cell death proteins. transgenic mouse models of human neurodegenerative disease are beginning to reveal possible principles governing the biology of selective neuronal vulnerability that implicate mitochondria and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. this review summarizes how mitochondrial pathobiology might contribute to neuronal death in ad, pd, and als and could serve as a target for drug therapy.
a c. elegans model for the study of rage-related neurodegeneration advanced glycation end products (ages), formed as the result of the extended interaction of proteins with ketoses, modulate central properties of endothelial cells and mononuclear phagocytes by interacting with a cell surface binding site comprised of a novel integral membrane protein (receptor for age = rage) and a lactoferrin-like polypeptide (lf-l), the latter having sequence identity to lactoferrin (lf). to further understand this cellular binding site, the interaction of rage with lf-l and lf was characterized. by ligand blotting and a solid state competitive binding assay, 125i-lf-l and 125i-lf bound to rage immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes or polypropylene tubes in a time-dependent and reversible manner, demonstrating a high affinity component with kd approximately 100 pm. the interaction of 125i-lf-l and 125i-lf with rage was independent of iron in lf and was competed by addition of an excess of unlabeled carboxyl-terminal portion of lf. cross-linking studies with purified 125i-lf-l and rage, in the presence of disuccinimidyl suberate, showed a new, slowly migrating band, corresponding to a complex of rage and lf-l, and cross-linking on mouse aortic endothelial cells showed two new slowly migrating bands on immunoblotting visualized with both anti-rage igg and anti-lf-l igg. these data lead us to propose that the endothelial cell surface binding site for ages consists of lf-l bound noncovalently to rage anchored in the cell membrane.
gentamicin-attenuated leishmania infantum vaccine: protection of dogs against canine visceral leishmaniosis in endemic area of southeast of iran we have previously described an attenuated line of leishmania infantum (h-line), selected by culturing promastigotes in vitro in the presence of gentamicin. to elucidate the molecular basis for this attenuation, we undertook a comparative proteomic analysis using multiplex 2-dimensional (2d) difference gel electrophoresis. eighteen proteins that showed significant and reproducible changes in expression were identified. many of these were components of the thiol-redox control system in leishmania and this observation, validated by western blot, prompted us to investigate the sensitivity of the attenuated line to oxidative stress. the attenuated line was found to be significantly more susceptible to hydrogen peroxide, a change which may explain the loss of virulence. in a direct assay of trypanothione-dependent peroxidase activity, hydrogen peroxide metabolism in the h-line was significantly lower than in wild type. furthermore, trypanothione reductase activity was significantly lower in the h-line, suggesting that gentamicin selection may result in pleiotropic affects on thiol metabolism in leishmania. a putative rna-binding protein was very strongly up-regulated in the attenuated line, suggesting a possible target for gentamicin in leishmania.
the development and validation of a fast and robust dried blood spot based lipid profiling method to study infant metabolism dyslipidemia is an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes, although exactly which of the many plasma lipids contribute to this remains unclear. we therefore investigated whether lipid profiling can inform diabetes prediction by performing liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-based lipid profiling in 189 individuals who developed type 2 diabetes and 189 matched disease-free individuals, with over 12 years of follow up in the framingham heart study. we found that lipids of lower carbon number and double bond content were associated with an increased risk of diabetes, whereas lipids of higher carbon number and double bond content were associated with decreased risk. this pattern was strongest for triacylglycerols (tags) and persisted after multivariable adjustment for age, sex, bmi, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, total triglycerides, and hdl cholesterol. a combination of 2 tags further improved diabetes prediction. to explore potential mechanisms that modulate the distribution of plasma lipids, we performed lipid profiling during oral glucose tolerance testing, pharmacologic interventions, and acute exercise testing. levels of tags associated with increased risk for diabetes decreased in response to insulin action and were elevated in the setting of insulin resistance. conversely, levels of tags associated with decreased diabetes risk rose in response to insulin and were poorly correlated with insulin resistance. these studies identify a relationship between lipid acyl chain content and diabetes risk and demonstrate how lipid profiling could aid in clinical risk assessment.
abnormal insula functional network is associated with episodic memory decline in amnestic mild cognitive impairment alzheimer's disease (ad) is a neurodegenerative disorder that prominently affects cerebral connectivity. assessing the functional connectivity at rest, recent functional mri (fmri) studies reported on the existence of resting-state networks (rsns). rsns are characterized by spatially coherent, spontaneous fluctuations in the blood oxygen level-dependent signal and are made up of regional patterns commonly involved in functions such as sensory, attention, or default mode processing. in ad, the default mode network (dmn) is affected by reduced functional connectivity and atrophy. in this work, we analyzed functional and structural mri data from healthy elderly (n = 16) and patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (amci) (n = 24), a syndrome of high risk for developing ad. two questions were addressed: (i) are any rsns altered in amci? (ii) do changes in functional connectivity relate to possible structural changes? independent component analysis of resting-state fmri data identified eight spatially consistent rsns. only selected areas of the dmn and the executive attention network demonstrated reduced network-related activity in the patient group. voxel-based morphometry revealed atrophy in both medial temporal lobes (mtl) of the patients. the functional connectivity between both hippocampi in the mtls and the posterior cingulate of the dmn was present in healthy controls but absent in patients. we conclude that in individuals at risk for ad, a specific subset of rsns is altered, likely representing effects of ongoing early neurodegeneration. we interpret our finding as a proof of principle, demonstrating that functional brain disorders can be characterized by functional-disconnectivity profiles of rsns.
ftir spectroscopic study of molecular organization of the antibiotic amphotericin b in aqueous solution and in dppc lipid monolayers containing the sterols cholesterol and ergosterol monolayers of amphotericin b (amb) and monolayers composed of amb and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (dppc) were formed at the argon–water interface and deposited on a solid support by means of the langmuir–blodgett technique. the hypsochromic shift observed in the absorption spectra of monolayers is indicative of aggregated structures of amb. the exciton splitting theory allowed us to calculate the distance between neighboring molecules in the aggregates as 7.8 å. scanning force microscopy of the amb monolayers revealed the formation of a homogeneous monolayer composed of molecules separated by a distance of 6–8 å. microscopy also reveals the formation of cylindrical structures of amb with a diameter close to 17 å (internal diameter close to 6 å) in the monolayers containing additionally 10 mol% dppc.
prediction of the human ep1 receptor binding site by homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulation we have characterized the rat prostanoid ep1, ep2, ep3alpha and ep4 receptor subtypes cloned from spleen, hepatocyte and/or kidney cdna libraries. comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the rat ep receptors with their respective homologues from mouse and human showed 91% to 98% and 82% to 89% identity, respectively. radioreceptor binding assays and functional assays were performed on ep receptor expressing human embryonic kidney (hek) 293 cells. the kd values obtained with prostaglandin e2 for the prostanoid receptor subtypes ep1, ep2, ep3alpha and ep4 were approximately 24, 5, 1 and 1 nm, respectively. the rank order of affinities for various prostanoids at the prostanoid receptor subtypes ep2, ep3alpha and ep4 receptor subtypes was prostaglandin e2 = prostaglandin e1 > iloprost > prostaglandin f2alpha > prostaglandin d2 > u46619. the rank order at the prostanoid ep1 receptor was essentially the same except that iloprost had the highest affinity of the prostanoids tested. of the selective ligands, butaprost was selective for prostanoid ep2, m&b28767 and sulprostone were selective for ep3alpha and enprostil displayed dual selectivity, interacting with both prostanoid receptor subtypes ep1 and ep3alpha. all four receptors coupled to their predominant signal transduction pathways in hek 293 cells. notably, using a novel aequorin luminescence assay to monitor prostanoid ep1 mediated increases in intracellular calcium, both iloprost and sulprostone were identified as partial agonists. finally, by northern blot analysis ep3 transcripts were most abundant in liver and kidney whereas prostanoid ep2 receptor mrna was expressed in spleen, lung and testis and prostanoid ep1 receptor mrna transcripts were predominantly expressed in the kidney. the rat prostanoid ep1 probes also detected additional and abundant transcripts present in all the tissues examined. these were found to be related to the expression of a novel protein kinase gene and not the prostanoid ep1 gene [batshake, b., sundelin, j., 1996. the mouse genes for the ep1 prostanoid receptor and the novel protein kinase overlap. biochem. biophys. res. commun. 227. 1329-1333].
emerging antibody-based therapeutic strategies for bladder cancer: a systematic review. the development of human cancer is a multistep process characterized by the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations that drive or reflect tumour progression. these changes distinguish cancer cells from their normal counterparts, allowing tumours to be recognized as foreign by the immune system. however, tumours are rarely rejected spontaneously, reflecting their ability to maintain an immunosuppressive microenvironment. programmed death-ligand 1 (pd-l1; also called b7-h1 or cd274), which is expressed on many cancer and immune cells, plays an important part in blocking the ‘cancer immunity cycle’ by binding programmed death-1 (pd-1) and b7.1 (cd80), both of which are negative regulators of t-lymphocyte activation. binding of pd-l1 to its receptors suppresses t-cell migration, proliferation and secretion of cytotoxic mediators, and restricts tumour cell killing. the pd-l1–pd-1 axis protects the host from overactive t-effector cells not only in cancer but also during microbial infections. blocking pd-l1 should therefore enhance anticancer immunity, but little is known about predictive factors of efficacy. this study was designed to evaluate the safety, activity and biomarkers of pd-l1 inhibition using the engineered humanized antibody mpdl3280a. here we show that across multiple cancer types, responses (as evaluated by response evaluation criteria in solid tumours, version 1.1) were observed in patients with tumours expressing high levels of pd-l1, especially when pd-l1 was expressed by tumour-infiltrating immune cells. furthermore, responses were associated with t-helper type 1 (th1) gene expression, ctla4 expression and the absence of fractalkine (cx3cl1) in baseline tumour specimens. together, these data suggest that mpdl3280a is most effective in patients in which pre-existing immunity is suppressed by pd-l1, and is re-invigorated on antibody treatment.
interpretable convolutional neural networks detecting objects becomes difficult when we need to deal with large shape deformation, occlusion and low resolution. we propose a novel approach to i) handle large deformations and partial occlusions in animals (as examples of highly deformable objects), ii) describe them in terms of body parts, and iii) detect them when their body parts are hard to detect (e.g., animals depicted at low resolution). we represent the holistic object and body parts separately and use a fully connected model to arrange templates for the holistic object and body parts. our model automatically decouples the holistic object or body parts from the model when they are hard to detect. this enables us to represent a large number of holistic object and body part combinations to better deal with different "detectability" patterns caused by deformations, occlusion and/or low resolution. we apply our method to the six animal categories in the pascal voc dataset and show that our method significantly improves state-of-the-art (by 4.1% ap) and provides a richer representation for objects. during training we use annotations for body parts (e.g., head, torso, etc.), making use of a new dataset of fully annotated object parts for pascal voc 2010, which provides a mask for each part.

increased brain iron coincides with early plaque formation in a mouse model of alzheimer's disease objective: to determine whether changes in brain biometals in alzheimer disease (ad) and in normal brain tissue are tandemly associated with amyloid β-peptide (aβ) burden and dementia severity. methods: the authors measured zinc, copper, iron, manganese, and aluminum and aβ levels in postmortem neocortical tissue from patients with ad (n = 10), normal age-matched control subjects (n = 14), patients with schizophrenia (n = 26), and patients with schizophrenia with amyloid (n = 8). severity of cognitive impairment was assessed with the clinical dementia rating scale (cdr). results: there was a significant, more than twofold, increase of tissue zinc in the ad-affected cortex compared with the other groups. zinc levels increased with tissue amyloid levels. zinc levels were significantly elevated in the most severely demented cases (cdr 4 to 5) and in cases that had an amyloid burden greater than 8 plaques/mm2. levels of other metals did not differ between groups. conclusions: brain zinc accumulation is a prominent feature of advanced alzheimer disease (ad) and is biochemically linked to brain amyloid β-peptide accumulation and dementia severity in ad.
the common chymotrypsinogen c (ctrc) variant g60g (c.180t) increases risk of chronic pancreatitis but not recurrent acute pancreatitis in a north american population pancreatitis is a complex, progressively destructive inflammatory disorder. alcohol was long thought to be the primary causative agent, but genetic contributions have been of interest since the discovery that rare prss1, cftr and spink1 variants were associated with pancreatitis risk. we now report two associations at genome-wide significance identified and replicated at prss1-prss2 (p < 1 × 10−12) and x-linked cldn2 (p < 1 × 10−21) through a two-stage genome-wide study (stage 1: 676 cases and 4,507 controls; stage 2: 910 cases and 4,170 controls). the prss1 variant likely affects disease susceptibility by altering expression of the primary trypsinogen gene. the cldn2 risk allele is associated with atypical localization of claudin-2 in pancreatic acinar cells. the homozygous (or hemizygous in males) cldn2 genotype confers the greatest risk, and its alleles interact with alcohol consumption to amplify risk. these results could partially explain the high frequency of alcohol-related pancreatitis in men (male hemizygote frequency is 0.26, whereas female homozygote frequency is 0.07).
let the tree bloom: scalable opportunistic routing with orpl traditionally, routing in wireless sensor networks consists of two steps: first, the routing protocol selects a next hop, and, second, the mac protocol waits for the intended destination to wake up and receive the data. this design makes it difficult to adapt to link dynamics and introduces delays while waiting for the next hop to wake up. in this paper we introduce orw, a practical opportunistic routing scheme for wireless sensor networks. in a duty-cycled setting, packets are addressed to sets of potential receivers and forwarded by the neighbor that wakes up first and successfully receives the packet. this reduces delay and energy consumption by utilizing all neighbors as potential forwarders. furthermore, this increases resilience to wireless link dynamics by exploiting spatial diversity. our results show that orw reduces radio duty-cycles on average by 50% (up to 90% on individual nodes) and delays by 30% to 90% when compared to the state of the art.
cell death induced by zinc and cadmium is mediated by clusterin in cultured mouse seminiferous tubules nuclear clusterin (nclu) is an ionizing radiation (ir)-inducible protein that binds ku70, and triggers apoptosis when overexpressed in mcf-7 cells. we demonstrate that endogenous nclu synthesis is a product of alternative splicing. reverse transcriptase-pcr analyses revealed that exon ii, containing the first aug and encoding the endoplasmic reticulum-targeting peptide, was omitted. exons i and iii are spliced together placing a downstream aug in exon iii as the first available translation start site. this shorter mrna produces the 49-kda precursor nclu protein. ku70 binding activity was localized to the c-terminal coiled-coil domain of nclu. leucine residues 357, 358, and 361 of nclu were necessary for ku70-nclu interaction. the n- and c-terminal coiled-coil domains of nclu interacted with each other, suggesting that the protein could dimerize or fold. mutation analyses indicate that the c-terminal nls was functional in nclu with the same contribution from n-terminal nls. the c-terminal coiled-coil domain of nclu was the minimal region required for ku binding and apoptosis. mcf-7 cells show nuclear as well as cytoplasmic expression of gfp-nclu in apoptotic cells. cytosolic aggregation of gfp-nclu was found in viable cells. these results indicate that an inactive precursor of nclu exists in the cytoplasm of non-irradiated mcf-7 cells, translocates into the nucleus following ir, and induces apoptosis.
understanding compliance to privacy guidelines using text-and video-based scenarios studies have repeatedly shown that users are increasingly concerned about their privacy when they go online. in response to both public interest and regulatory pressures, privacy policies have become almost ubiquitous. an estimated 77% of websites now post a privacy policy. these policies differ greatly from site to site, and often address issues that are different from those that users care about. they are in most cases the users' only source of information.this paper evaluates the usability of online privacy policies, as well as the practice of posting them. we analyze 64 current privacy policies, their accessibility, writing, content and evolution over time. we examine how well these policies meet user needs and how they can be improved. we determine that significant changes need to be made to current practice to meet regulatory and usability requirements.
how quickly can we adapt to change? an assessment of hurricane damage mitigation efforts using forecast uncertainty damage due to tropical cyclones accounts for more than 50% of all meteorologically-induced economic losses worldwide. their nominal impact is projected to increase substantially as the exposed population grows, per capita income increases, and anthropogenic climate change manifests. so far, historical losses due to tropical cyclones have been found to increase less than linearly with a nation's affected gross domestic product (gdp). here we show that for the united states this scaling is caused by a sub-linear increase with affected population while relative losses scale super-linearly with per capita income. the finding is robust across a multitude of empirically derived damage models that link the storm's wind speed, exposed population, and per capita gdp to reported losses. the separation of both socio-economic predictors strongly affects the projection of potential future hurricane losses. separating the effects of growth in population and per-capita income, per hurricane losses with respect to national gdp are projected to triple by the end of the century under unmitigated climate change, while they are estimated to decrease slightly without the separation.
regulation of endothelial inflammation by tam receptors the endothelial cell is thought to arise from the splanchnopleuric mesoderm. endothelial cells form the inner lining of a blood vessel and provides an anticoagulant barrier between the vessel wall and blood. in addition to its role as a selective permeability barrier, the endothelial cell is a unique multifunctional cell with critical basal and inducible metabolic and synthetic functions. the endothelial cell reacts with physical and chemical stimuli within the circulation and regulates hemostasis, vasomotor tone, and immune and inflammatory responses. in addition, the endothelial cell is pivotal in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. endothelial cell injury, activation or dysfunction is a hallmark of many pathologic states including atherosclerosis, loss of semi-permeable membrane function, and thrombosis. cell facts: (1) endothelium consists of approximately (1-6) x 10(13) endothelial cells forming an almost 1 kg organ. (2) they uniquely contain weibel-palade bodies, 0.1 microm wide, 3 microm long membrane-bound structures that represent the storage organelle for von willebrand factor (vwf). (3) the endothelial cell is not only a permeability barrier but also a multifunctional paracrine and endocrine organ. it is involved in the immune response, coagulation, growth regulation, production of extracellular matrix components, and is a modulator of blood flow and blood vessel tone.
ocean acidification-induced restructuring of the plankton food web can influence the degradation of sinking particles one of the great challenges in ocean change research is to understand and forecast the effects of environmental changes on pelagic communities and the associated impacts on biogeochemical cycling. mesocosms, experimental enclosures designed to approximate natural conditions, and in which environmental factors can be manipulated and closely monitored, provide a powerful tool to close the gap between single species laboratory experiments and observational and correlative approaches applied in field surveys. existing pelagic mesocosm systems are stationary and/or restricted to well-protected waters. to allow mesocosm experimentation in a range of hydrographic conditions and in areas considered most sensitive to ocean change, we developed a mobile, sea-going mesocosm facility, the kiel off-shore mesocosms for future ocean simulations (kosmos). the kosmos platform, which can be transported and deployed by mid-sized research vessels, is designed for operation in moored and free-floating mode under low to moderate wave conditions (up to 2.5 m wave heights). it encloses a water column 2 m in diameter and 15 to 25 m deep (~50–75 m3 in volume) without disrupting the vertical structure or disturbing the enclosed plankton community. several new developments in mesocosm design and operation were implemented to (i) minimize differences in starting conditions between mesocosms, (ii) allow for extended experimental duration, (iii) precisely determine the mesocosm volume, (iv) determine air–sea gas exchange, and (v) perform mass balance calculations. after multiple test runs in the baltic sea, which resulted in continuous improvement of the design and handling, the kosmos platform successfully completed its first full-scale experiment in the high arctic off svalbard (78° 56.2′ n, 11° 53.6′ e) in june/july 2010. the study, which was conducted in the framework of the european project on ocean acidification (epoca), focused on the effects of ocean acidification on a natural plankton community and its impacts on biogeochemical cycling and air/sea exchange of climate relevant gases. this manuscript describes the mesocosm hardware, its deployment and handling, co2 manipulation, sampling and cleaning, including some further modifications conducted based on the experiences gained during this study.
heme oxygenase-1 regulates mitochondrial quality control in the heart. background— heme oxygenase-1 (ho-1) is an inducible stress-response protein that imparts antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects. however, its pathophysiological role in cardiac remodeling and chronic heart failure (hf) is unknown. we hypothesized that induction of ho-1 in hf alleviates pathological remodeling. methods and results— adult male nontransgenic and myocyte-restricted ho-1 transgenic mice underwent either sham operation or coronary ligation to induce hf. four weeks after ligation, nontransgenic hf mice exhibited postinfarction left ventricular (lv) remodeling and dysfunction, hypertrophy, fibrosis, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and reduced capillary density, associated with a 2-fold increase in ho-1 expression in noninfarcted myocardium. compared with nontransgenic mice, ho-1 transgenic hf mice exhibited significantly (p<0.05) improved postinfarction survival (94% versus 57%) and less lv dilatation (end-diastolic volume, 46±8 versus 85±32 &mgr;l), mechanical dysfunction (ejection fraction, 65±9% versus 49±16%), hypertrophy (lv/tibia length 4.4±0.4 versus 5.2±0.6 mg/mm), interstitial fibrosis (11.2±3.1% versus 18.5±3.5%), and oxidative stress (3-fold reduction in tissue malondialdehyde). moreover, myocyte-specific ho-1 overexpression in hf promoted tissue neovascularization and ameliorated myocardial p53 expression (2-fold reduction) and apoptosis. in isolated mitochondria, mitochondrial permeability transition was inhibited by ho-1 in a carbon monoxide (co)–dependent manner and was recapitulated by the co donor tricarbonylchloro(glycinato)ruthenium(ii) (corm-3). ho-1–derived co also prevented h2o2-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cell death. finally, in vivo treatment with corm-3 alleviated postinfarction lv remodeling, p53 expression, and apoptosis. conclusions— ho-1 induction in the failing heart is an important cardioprotective adaptation that opposes pathological lv remodeling, and this effect is mediated, at least in part, by co-dependent inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition and apoptosis. augmentation of ho-1 or its product, co, may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for ameliorating hf.
effects of exercise training on dendritic morphology in the cardiorespiratory and locomotor centers of the mature rat brain. no previous report in any species has systematically examined the descending projections of the posterior nucleus of the hypothalamus (ph). the present report describes the descending projections of the ph in the rat by using the anterograde anatomical tracer, phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin. ph fibers mainly descend to the brainstem through two routes: dorsally, within the central tegmental tract; and ventromedially, within the mammillo‐tegmental tract and its caudal extension, ventral reticulo‐tegmental tracts. ph fibers were found to distribute densely to several nuclei of the brainstem. they are (from rostral to caudal) 1) lateral/ventrolateral regions of the diencephalo‐mesopontine periaqueductal gray (pag); 2) the peripeduncular nucleus; 3) discrete nuclei of pontomesencephalic central gray (dorsal raphe nucleus, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, and barrington's nucleus); 4) the longitudinal extent of the central core of the mesencephalic through medullary reticular formation (rf); 5) the ventromedial medulla (nucleus gigantocellularis pars alpha, nucleus raphe magnus, and nucleus raphe pallidus); 6) the ventrolateral medulla (nucleus reticularis parvocellularis and the rostral ventrolateral medullary region); and 7) the inferior olivary nucleus. ph fibers originating from the caudal ph distribute much more heavily than those from the rostral ph to the lower brainstem.
simtb, a simulation toolbox for fmri data under a model of spatiotemporal separability independent component analysis (ica) has become an increasingly utilized approach for analyzing brain imaging data. in contrast to the widely used general linear model (glm) that requires the user to parameterize the data (e.g. the brain's response to stimuli), ica, by relying upon a general assumption of independence, allows the user to be agnostic regarding the exact form of the response. in addition, ica is intrinsically a multivariate approach, and hence each component provides a grouping of brain activity into regions that share the same response pattern thus providing a natural measure of functional connectivity. there are a wide variety of ica approaches that have been proposed, in this paper we focus upon two distinct methods. the first part of this paper reviews the use of ica for making group inferences from fmri data. we provide an overview of current approaches for utilizing ica to make group inferences with a focus upon the group ica approach implemented in the gift software. in the next part of this paper, we provide an overview of the use of ica to combine or fuse multimodal data. ica has proven particularly useful for data fusion of multiple tasks or data modalities such as single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) data or event-related potentials. as demonstrated by a number of examples in this paper, ica is a powerful and versatile data-driven approach for studying the brain.
the secret life of the anthrax agent bacillus anthracis: bacteriophage-mediated ecological adaptations phage-mediated lysis has been an essential laboratory tool for rapidly identifying bacillus anthracis for more than 40 years, relying on the gamma phage derivative of a bacillus cereus prophage called w. the complete genomic sequences of the temperate w phage, referred to as wbeta, and its lytic variant gamma were determined and found to encode 53 open reading frames each, spanning 40,864 bp and 37,373 bp, respectively. direct comparison of the genomes showed that gamma evolved through mutations at key loci controlling host recognition, lysogenic growth, and possibly host phenotypic modification. included are a cluster of point mutations at the gp14 tail fiber locus of gamma, encoding a protein that, when fused to green fluorescent protein, binds specifically to b. anthracis. a large 2,003-bp deletion was also identified at the gamma lysogeny module, explaining its shift from a temperate to a lytic lifestyle. finally, evidence of recombination was observed at a dicistronic wbeta locus, encoding putative bacterial cell surface-modifying proteins, replaced in gamma with a locus, likely obtained from a b. anthracis prophage, encoding demonstrable fosfomycin resistance. reverse transcriptase pcr analysis confirmed strong induction at the dicistronic wbeta locus and at four other phage loci in b. anthracis and/or b. cereus lysogens. in all, this study represents the first genomic and functional description of two historically important phages and is part of a broader investigation into contributions of phage to the b. anthracis life cycle. initial findings suggest that lysogeny of b. anthracis promotes ecological adaptation, rather than virulence, as with other gram-positive pathogens.
a genome-wide survey of hd-zip genes in rice and analysis of drought-responsive family members hahb-4 is a member of the helianthusannuus (sunflower) subfamily i of hd-zip proteins that is transcriptionally regulated by water availability and abscisic acid. transgenic arabidopsis thaliana plants overexpressing this transcription factor (tf) exhibit a characteristic phenotype that includes a strong tolerance to water stress. here we show that this tf is a new component of ethylene signalling pathways, and that it induces a marked delay in senescence. plants overexpressing hahb-4 are less sensitive to external ethylene, enter the senescence pathway later and do not show the typical triple response. furthermore, transgenic plants expressing this gene under the control of its own inducible promoter showed an inverse correlation between ethylene sensitivity and hahb-4 levels. potential targets of hahb-4 were identified by comparing the transcriptome of hahb-4-transformed and wild-type plants using microarrays and quantitative rt-pcr. expression of this tf has a major repressive effect on genes related to ethylene synthesis, such as aco and sam, and on genes related to ethylene signalling, such as erf2 and erf5. expression studies in sunflower indicate that hahb-4 transcript levels are elevated in mature/senescent leaves. expression of hahb-4 is induced by ethylene, concomitantly with several genes homologous to the targets identified in the transcriptome analysis (ha-acoa and ha-acob). transient transformation of sunflower leaves demonstrated the action of hahb-4 in the regulation of ethylene-related genes. we propose that hahb-4 is involved in a novel conserved mechanism related to ethylene-mediated senescence that functions to improve desiccation tolerance.
a interaction with the cxcr 4 third intracellular loop regulates endocytosis and signaling of wt and whim-like receptors chemotaxis mediated by chemokine receptors such as cxcr4 plays a key role in lymphocyte homing and hematopoiesis as well as in breast cancer metastasis. we have demonstrated previously that β-arrestin2 functions to attenuate cxcr4-mediated g protein activation and to enhance cxcr4 internalization. here we show further that the expression of β-arrestin2 in both hela and human embryonic kidney 293 cells significantly enhances the chemotactic efficacy of stromal cell-derived factor 1α, the specific agonist of cxcr4, whereas the suppression of β-arrestin2 endogenous expression by antisense or rna-mediated interference technology considerably attenuates stromal cell-derived factor 1α-induced cell migration. expression of β-arrestin2 also augmented chemokine receptor ccr5-mediated but not epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated chemotaxis, indicating the specific effect of β-arrestin2. further analysis reveals that expression of β-arrestin2 strengthened cxcr4-mediated activation of both p38 mapk and erk, and the suppression of β-arrestin2 expression blocked the activation of two kinases. interestingly, inhibition of p38 mapk activation (but not erk activation) by its inhibitors or by expression of a dominant-negative mutant of p38 mapk effectively blocked the chemotactic effect of β-arrestin2. expression of a dominant-negative mutant of ask1 also exerted the similar blocking effect. the results of our study suggest that β-arrestin2 can function not only as a regulator of cxcr4 signaling but also as a mediator of stromal cell-derived factor 1α-induced chemotaxis and that this activity probably occurs via the ask1/p38 mapk pathway.
robust stability criteria for takagi-sugeno fuzzy cohen-grossberg neural networks of neutral type abstract in this paper, by using topological degree theory and lyapunov–krasovskii function method, the problem of stability is investigated for a class of mixed-delayed cohen–grossberg neural networks with inverse lipschitz neuron activations and nonsmooth behaved functions. several novel delay-dependent sufficient conditions are established towards the existence, uniqueness and global exponential stability of the equilibrium point, which are shown in terms of linear matrix inequalities. besides, for the case of the activation function satisfying not only the inverse lipschitz conditions but also the lipschitz conditions, two criteria are derived by virtue of homeomorphism mapping principle, free-weighting matrix method and cauchy–schwarz inequality, which generalize some previous results. finally, two examples with their simulations are given to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.
what is the daily practice of mechanical ventilation in pediatric intensive care units? a multicenter study in a retrospective chart review of cases of adult respiratory distress syndrome in our pediatric intensive care unit from 1987 to 1990, we attempted to identify the physiologic variables predictive of death. we identified 44 children with adult respiratory distress syndrome; the mortality rate was 75%. we found significant differences between survivors and nonsurvivors in intrapulmonary venous admixture (qsp/qt), mean airway pressure (paw), alveolar-arterial oxygen tension difference (p(a-a)o2), oxygenation index, and peak inspirator pressure; qsp/qt greater than 0.5, paw greater than 23 cm h2o, and p(a-a)o2 greater than 470 mm hg were 93%, 90%, and 81% predictive of death, respectively, in this study population. sensitivity and specificity were enhanced when we linked multiple predictors, but this linkage was seldom successful because few patients had more than one positive predictor. we propose to use the individual predictors that we have identified as randomization criteria in a future trial of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for pediatric cases of adult respiratory distress syndrome.
contextual statistics of space-time ordered features for human action recognition local image features or interest points provide compact and abstract representations of patterns in an image. in this paper, we extend the notion of spatial interest points into the spatio-temporal domain and show how the resulting features often reflect interesting events that can be used for a compact representation of video data as well as for interpretation of spatio-temporal events.to detect spatio-temporal events, we build on the idea of the harris and förstner interest point operators and detect local structures in space-time where the image values have significant local variations in both space and time. we estimate the spatio-temporal extents of the detected events by maximizing a normalized spatio-temporal laplacian operator over spatial and temporal scales. to represent the detected events, we then compute local, spatio-temporal, scale-invariant n-jets and classify each event with respect to its jet descriptor. for the problem of human motion analysis, we illustrate how a video representation in terms of local space-time features allows for detection of walking people in scenes with occlusions and dynamic cluttered backgrounds.
outreach and support in south london (oasis). outcomes of non-attenders to a service for people at high risk of psychosis: the case for a more assertive approach to assessment. background while recent research points to the potential benefits of clinical intervention before the first episode of psychosis, the logistical feasibility of this is unclear.   aims to assess the feasibility of providing a clinical service for people with prodromal symptoms in an inner city area where engagement with mental health services is generally poor.   method following a period of liaison with local agencies to promote the service, referrals were assessed and managed in a primary care setting. activity of the service was audited over 30 months.   results people with prodromal symptoms were referred by a range of community agencies and seen at their local primary care physician practice. over 30 months, 180 clients were referred; 58 (32.2%) met criteria for an at risk mental state, most of whom (67.2%) had attenuated psychotic symptoms. almost 30% were excluded due to current or previous psychotic illness, of which two-thirds were in the first episode of psychosis. the socio-demographic composition of the 'at risk' group reflected that of the local population, with an over-representation of clients from an ethnic minority. over 90% of suitable clients remained engaged with the service after 1 year.   conclusion it is feasible to provide a clinical service for people with prodromal symptoms in a deprived inner city area with a large ethnic minority population.
optimal study design for pioglitazone in septic pediatric patients growth and development can be investigated using readily observable demographic factors such as weight and age. size is the primary covariate and can be referenced to a 70-kg person with allometry using a coefficient of 0.75 for clearance and 1 for volume. the use of these coefficients is supported by fractal geometric concepts and observations from diverse areas in biology. fat free mass (ffm) might be expected to do better than total body weight when there are wide variations in fat affecting body composition. clearance pathways develop in the fetus before birth. the use of postnatal age as a descriptor of maturation is unsatisfactory because birth may occur prematurely; therefore postmenstrual age is a superior predictor of elimination function. a sigmoid e(max) model (hill equation) describes gradual maturation of clearance in early life leading to a mature adult clearance achieved at a later age.
erythrocytes do not activate purified and platelet soluble guanylate cyclases even in conditions favourable for no synthesis it is now appreciated that two parallel systems regulate nitric oxide (no) formation and signaling in biological systems and the vasculature. the first is the canonical endothelial no synthase (enos) system, which catalyzes a five-electron oxidation of l-arginine to form no and citrulline [30]. the second is the nitrate–nitrite–no pathway, a more primitive, oxygen-independent and reductive pathway, clearly of great importance in bacteria and plants and only more recently found to regulate mammalian control of blood pressure, energetics, and hypoxic vasodilation [6,11,12,25,26,29]. now, as described in the current study by velmurugan and colleagues [40], this pathway may also inhibit platelet activation, an effect thought to be primarily regulated by no produced by enos [9,23,24,36]. although mammals do not possess nitrate reductase enzymes, the mouth commensal flora provides the necessary symbiosis, with bacterial nitrate reductase enzymes converting nitrate in food and concentrated in saliva into nitrite, which is swallowed and systemically absorbed [2,3,27]. there is cross talk between both no synthesis pathways. nitrite in the blood and tissue derives equally from nitrate reduction by oral bacteria and from intravascular oxidation of no formed from enos [35,44]. thus enos regulates blood flow via endothelial no formation and paracrine signaling to smooth muscle but also contributes to endocrine no formation via oxidation to nitrite and transport to distal sites for regional reduction to no [4,8,12]. interestingly, both systems also generate superoxide, as the no synthase system can become uncoupled in settings of subcellular l-arginine and tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency or enos glutathionylation (oxidation), and then exhibits an oxidase activity, forming superoxide rather than no [5]. the enzymes that have been shown to reduce nitrite to no, such as the molybdopterin family members xanthine oxidase and aldehyde oxidase [21,22,28,42,45] and the heme globin family, hemoglobin, myoglobin, and neuroglobin [6,10,17,38,39], can all form superoxide as well. the fact that these systems can generate no, superoxide, or both provides for a diversified signaling profile from no, superoxide, peroxynitrite, nitrogen dioxide, and dinitrogen trioxide [1,13,41]. nitrite itself is uniquely positioned as a relatively stable reactive nitrogen species (half-life in humans of approximately 40 min) but is readily reduced to no, oxidized to nitrogen dioxide and dinitrogen trioxide, and protonated to form nitrous acid–nitrosonium cation [41]. thus nitrite may contribute to redox signaling via no activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase, as well as targeting protein cysteine and tyrosine residues to regulate posttranslational signaling. although it has been known for almost 3 decades that oral nitrate can be reduced in the mouth to form nitrite, which is then converted in the stomach to no to regulate mucosal blood flow, mucus production, and mucosal host defense via no-mediated bacterial killing [2,3,27], a role for nitrite in the systemic formation of no and systemic vasomotor function was only more recently appreciated [6,12,29]. it is now increasingly clear that nitrite, derived from dietary nitrate and enos, regulates blood pressure, blood flow, hypoxic vasodilation, and the cellular resilience to ischemia and reperfusion cytotoxicity in the heart and liver [6,7,12,18,42,43]. more recently, a role for this pathway in the control of mitochondrial proton leak and respiratory efficiency has been described [19,20]. the current study by velmurugan and colleagues [40] explores a new chapter in the role of the nitrate–nitrite–no pathway in cardiovascular function, by identifying an effect of dietary nitrate supplementation on platelet activation; importantly this effect requires red cells for bioconversion of nitrite to no (fig. 1). more specifically, the study summarizes the results of two randomized placebo-controlled crossover studies, each in 24 healthy subjects, assessing the acute effects of dietary nitrate or potassium nitrate capsules on platelet reactivity. oral nitrate in beet root juice or as a pure chemical raised circulating nitrate and nitrite levels, inhibited ex vivo platelet aggregation responses to adp and collagen, and reduced platelet p-selectin expression and elevated platelet cgmp levels. interestingly, these effects were observed in vivo (inhibition of platelets after oral nitrate supplementation) and in vitro with exposure of nitrite to whole blood, but not to platelet-rich plasma, suggesting a role for the red cells in the conversion of nitrite to signaling no. these findings thus further promote a physiological role for oral nitrate in the regulation of cardiovascular function, vasomotor control, energetics, and hemostasis, via formation of circulating nitrite.
a blood-csf barrier function controls embryonic csf protein composition and homeostasis during early cns development. embryonic cerebrospinal fluid (e-csf) is involved in the regulation of survival, proliferation and neurogenesis of neuroectodermal progenitor cells, as well as in the control of mesencephalic gene expression in collaboration with the isthmic organizer. recently, we showed the presence of retinol-binding protein (rbp) within the e-csf proteome. rbp is an all-trans retinol carrier, a molecule that can be metabolized into retinoic acid, a morphogen involved in central nervous system (cns) morphogenesis and patterning. here we demonstrate the presence of all-trans retinol within the e-csf and analyse the dynamics of rbp and all-trans retinol within this fluid, as well as the expression of retinoic acid-synthesizing enzymes during early cns development. our results suggest a relationship between the dynamics of these molecules and the early events of cns patterning.
distinct leaf‐trait syndromes of evergreen and deciduous trees in a seasonally dry tropical forest abstract independent contrasts are widely used to incorporate phylogenetic information into studies of continuous traits, particularly analyses of evolutionary trait correlations, but the effects of taxon sampling on these analyses have received little attention. in this paper, simulations were used to investigate the effects of taxon sampling patterns and alternative branch length assignments on the statistical performance of correlation coefficients and sign tests; “full‐tree” analyses based on contrasts at all nodes and “paired‐comparisons” based only on contrasts of terminal taxon pairs were also compared. the simulations showed that random samples, with respect to the traits under consideration, provide statistically robust estimates of trait correlations. however, exact significance tests are highly dependent on appropriate branch length information; equal branch lengths maintain lower type i error than alternative topological approaches, and adjusted critical values of the independent contrast correlation coefficient are provided for use with equal branch lengths. nonrandom samples, with respect to univariate or bivariate trait distributions, introduce discrepancies between interspecific and phylogenetically structured analyses and bias estimates of underlying evolutionary correlations. examples of nonrandom sampling processes may include community assembly processes, convergent evolution under local adaptive pressures, selection of a nonrandom sample of species from a habitat or life‐history group, or investigator bias. correlation analyses based on species pairs comparisons, while ignoring deeper relationships, entail significant loss of statistical power and as a result provide a conservative test of trait associations. paired comparisons in which species differ by a large amount in one trait, a method introduced in comparative plant ecology, have appropriate type i error rates and high statistical power, but do not correctly estimate the magnitude of trait correlations. sign tests, based on full‐tree or paired‐comparison approaches, are highly reliable across a wide range of sampling scenarios, in terms of type i error rates, but have very low power. these results provide guidance for selecting species and applying comparative methods to optimize the performance of statistical tests of trait associations.
a sustainability assessment of a health equity fund initiative in cambodia. sustainability continues to be a serious concern for primary health care (phc) interventions targeting the death of millions of children in developing countries each year. our work with over 30 non-governmental organizations (ngos) implementing usaid's child survival and health grants program (cshgp)-funded projects revealed the need for a study to develop a framework for sustainability assessment in these projects. we surveyed ngo informants and project managers through semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. this paper summarizes our study findings. the ngos share key values about sustainability, but are skeptical about approaches perceived as disconnected from field reality. in their experience, sustainable achievements occur through the interaction of capable local stakeholders and communities. this depends strongly on enabling conditions, which ngo projects should advance. sustainability assessment is multidimensional, value-based and embeds health within a larger sustainable development perspective. it reduces, but does not eliminate, the unpredictability of long-term outcomes. it should start with the consideration of the 'local systems' which need to develop a common purpose. our ability to address the complexity inherent to sustainability thinking rests with the validity of the models used to design interventions. a participant, qualitative research approach helped us make sense of sustainability in ngo field practice.
an approach to monitoring mangrove extents through time-series comparison of jers-1 sar and alos palsar data within the framework of an environmental impact study of aquaculture activities in the coastal marsh of mahajamba (north-western madagascar), an assessment of the environmental conditions existing prior to the onset of aquaculture activities (production began in october, 1993) is essential. to this end, the area was mapped using spot-xs data, which made it possible to define the main ecodynamic tendencies of the mangroves before the development of the rearing ponds. the aim was then to implement fast, precise and reliable mapping methods, making it possible to follow mangrove alterations resulting from these aquaculture activities. analysis of the radiometric behaviour of the various plant formations of the marsh, based on sir-c radar data, revealed that the discrimination between these formations is easier when the frequency used is low and the polarization is crossed. thematic analysis using textural classification was carried out with the l-band and polarization vh. the results generated are promising insofar as the mapping of mangroves is concerned with a fast treatment time and acceptable precision of the results.
can the lanss scale be used to classify pain in chronic cancer pain trials? abstract objective: to develop a patient-completed screening tool to help differentiate nociceptive and neuropathic pain. research design and methods: a multicenter study was performed for item reduction (initial 89-item questionnaire) and model building. patients (n = 586) with non-headache chronic pain completed the questionnaire and were referred to pain specialists for diagnosis. factor and regression analyses were used to derive a final, 6-item questionnaire – id pain. a second multicenter study evaluated reliability and validity. patients (n = 308) treated by pain specialists completed id pain and validation measures. main outcome measures: sensitivity and specificity were assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves and the concordance c index. reliability was assessed using a κ statistic and intraclass correlation coefficient. results: final 6 items were: did the pain feel: (1) like pins and needles? (2) hot/burning? (3) numb? (4) like electrical shocks? (5) is the pain made worse with the touch of clothing or bed sheets? (6) is the pain limited to your joints? ‘yes’ answers to questions 1–5 were scored as 1, while a ‘yes’ answer to question 6 was scored as –1. ‘no’ answers were scored as 0. higher scores (–1 to 5) suggested a neuropathic component. the questionnaire accurately predicted diagnoses of neuropathic pain made by pain specialists. the concordance c indices in the studies were 0.73 and 0.69. the icc was 0.742; the κ statistic ranged from 0.742 to 0.527. conclusions: id pain appeared to accurately indicate the presence of a neuropathic component of pain. as a brief, self-administered screening tool, it could be useful in primary care settings.
immune and acute phase response in pigs experimentally infected with h1n2 swine influenza virus. in the present study, acute phase proteins (app) responses in pigs after infection with toxigenic strain of pasteurella multocida (pm) were evaluated. twelve piglets from a herd free from toxigenic pm were used. six of them were infected intranasally with pm. crp, hp, saa and pig-map concentrations were measured using commercial elisa tests. crp and hp were significantly induced from 2 days post inoculation (dpi). the concentration of hp in inoculated pigs remained elevated until the end of the study. the concentrations of saa and pig-map increased significantly from 3 dpi, and remained elevated to 5 or 7 dpi, respectively. strong correlations were observed between concentration of hp or saa and changes in the lungs. no correlations were found between levels of app in serum and changes observed in the turbinates. on the basis of our investigation, we cannot state that evaluation of app concentrations in serum may provide useful information about severity of atrophic rhinitis. however, the concentration of all investigated app increased after inoculation. thus, app-measurements may reveal ongoing infection. monitoring of app concentrations in the pig herds may help to pinpoint infected animals even before clinical signs are present. if found, these "app-high" animals may be chosen next for pathogen-specific diagnostics. early diagnosis and therapy may prevent the infection from spreading in the herd. moreover, monitoring of app concentrations in serum may be useful for selecting clinically healthy pigs before integration into an uninfected herd. future studies should focus on the possibility of distinguishing infected and non-infected pigs under field conditions.
genetic variation in jasmonic acid- and spider mite-induced plant volatile emission of cucumber accessions and attraction of the predator phytoseiulus persimilis abstract after herbivore attack, plants launch a suite of direct and indirect defense responses that must be coordinated if plants are to realize a fitness benefit from these responses. here we characterize the volatile emissions in the native tobacco plant, nicotiana attenuata torr. ex wats., that are elicited by tobacco hornworm (manduca sexta l.) attack and are known to function as attractants for parasitoids. to provide the first ecophysiological comparison of examples of both types of defense in the same species, we characterize the elicitation and signaling mechanisms, the resources required, and the potential costs and benefits of the volatile release and compare these traits with those of the well-described induced direct defense in this species, nicotine production. the release of (e)-β-ocimene, cis-α-bergamotene and linalool is dramatically induced within 24 h by application of methyl jasmonate (meja), caterpillar feeding, and the treatment of mechanical wounds with larval oral secretions (os), but not by mechanical damage alone. plants from different geographic locations produce volatile blends that differ in composition. the most consistently released component from all genotypes, cis-α-berga-motene, is positively related to the amount of meja and the level of wounding if os are applied to the wounds. the volatile release is strongly light dependent, dropping to undetectable quantities during dark periods, even when temperatures are elevated to match those of the light period. inhibitors of wound-induced jasmonate accumulation (salicylates and auxins), which are known to inhibit wound-induced nicotine production, do not inhibit the release of volatiles. by individually inducing different leaf positions with os and, on other plants, excising them after induction, we demonstrate that the emission is largely a systemic, whole-plant response, which is maximally triggered when the second fully expanded leaf is induced. we conclude that while both are whole-plant, systemic responses that utilize recently acquired resources for their production and are activated by the jasmonate cascade, the elicitation of the volatile release exhibits greater tissue sensitivity and utilizes additional signaling components than does nicotine production. in contrast to the large investment of fitness-limiting resources required for induced nicotine production or the resources used in benzyl acetone release from flowers for pollinator attraction, the resource requirements for the volatile release are minor. hence the argument that the volatile release incurs comparatively large physiological costs cannot be supported in this system.
differences in helicobacter pylori caga tyrosine phosphorylation motif patterns between western and east asian strains, and influences on interleukin-8 secretion. helicobacter pylori is a causative agent of gastritis and peptic ulcer. caga+h. pylori strains are more virulent than caga− strains and are associated with gastric carcinoma. the caga gene product, caga, is injected by the bacterium into gastric epithelial cells and subsequently undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation. the phosphorylated caga specifically binds shp-2 phosphatase, activates the phosphatase activity, and thereby induces morphological transformation of cells. caga proteins of most western h. pylori isolates have a 34-amino acid sequence that variably repeats among different strains. here, we show that the repeat sequence contains a tyrosine phosphorylation site. caga proteins having more repeats were found to undergo greater tyrosine phosphorylation, to exhibit increased shp-2 binding, and to induce greater morphological changes. in contrast, predominant caga proteins specified by h. pylori strains isolated in east asia, where gastric carcinoma is prevalent, had a distinct tyrosine phosphorylation sequence at the region corresponding to the repeat sequence of western caga. this east asian-specific sequence conferred stronger shp-2 binding and morphologically transforming activities to western caga. finally, a critical amino acid residue that determines shp-2 binding activity among different caga proteins was identified. our results indicate that the potential of individual caga to perturb host-cell functions is determined by the degree of shp-2 binding activity, which depends in turn on the number and sequences of tyrosine phosphorylation sites. the presence of distinctly structured caga proteins in western and east asian h. pylori isolates may underlie the strikingly different incidences of gastric carcinoma in these two geographic areas.
reciprocal disruption of neuronal signaling and aβ production mediated by extrasynaptic nmda receptors: a downward spiral accumulated genetic evidence suggests that attenuation of the ratio between cerebral amyloid-β aβ40 and aβ42 isoforms is central to familial alzheimer's disease (fad) pathogenesis. however, fad mutations account for only 1–2% of alzheimer's disease cases, leaving the experience-dependent mechanisms regulating aβ40/42 an enigma. here we explored regulation of aβ40/42 ratio by temporal spiking patterns in the rodent hippocampus. spike bursts boosted aβ40/42 through a conformational change in presenilin1 (ps1), the catalytic subunit of γ-secretase, and subsequent increase in aβ40 production. conversely, single spikes did not alter basal ps1 conformation and aβ40/42. burst-induced ps1 conformational shift was mediated by means of ca2+-dependent synaptic vesicle exocytosis. presynaptic inhibition in vitro and visual deprivation in vivo augmented synaptic and aβ40/42 facilitation by bursts in the hippocampus. thus, burst probability and transfer properties of synapses represent fundamental features regulating aβ40/42 by experience and may contribute to the initiation of the common, sporadic alzheimer's disease.
higher education dominance and siloed knowledge: a systematic review of flipped classroom research recent calls for educational reform highlight ongoing concerns about the ability of current curricula to equip aspiring health care professionals with the skills for success. whereas a wide range of proposed solutions attempt to address apparent deficiencies in current educational models, a growing body of literature consistently points to the need to rethink the traditional in-class, lecture-based course model. one such proposal is the flipped classroom, in which content is offloaded for students to learn on their own, and class time is dedicated to engaging students in student-centered learning activities, like problem-based learning and inquiry-oriented strategies. in 2012, the authors flipped a required first-year pharmaceutics course at the university of north carolina eshelman school of pharmacy. they offloaded all lectures to self-paced online videos and used class time to engage students in active learning exercises. in this article, the authors describe the philosophy and methodology used to redesign the basic pharmaceutics ii course and outline the research they conducted to investigate the resulting outcomes. this article is intended to serve as a guide to instructors and educational programs seeking to develop, implement, and evaluate innovative and practical strategies to transform students’ learning experience. as class attendance, students’ learning, and the perceived value of this model all increased following participation in the flipped classroom, the authors conclude that this approach warrants careful consideration as educators aim to enhance learning, improve outcomes, and fully equip students to address 21st-century health care needs.
a parallel and fault tolerant file system based on nfs servers we propose a strategy for implementing parallel i/o interfaces portably and efficiently. we have defined an abstract device interface for parallel i/o, called adio. any parallel i/o api can be implemented on multiple file systems by implementing the api portably on top of adio, and implementing only adio on different file systems. this approach simplifies the task of implementing an api and yet exploits the specific high performance features of individual file systems. we have used adio to implement the intel pfs interface and subsets of mpi-io and ibm piofs interfaces on pfs, piofs, unix, and nfs file systems. our performance studies indicate that the overhead of using adio as an implementation strategy is very low.
urinary interleukin-2 may predict clinical outcome of intravesical bacillus calmette-guérin immunotherapy for carcinoma in situ of the bladder our previous studies suggested that interferon-gamma (ifn gamma) was produced in the local immune response to intravesical bcg. to confirm this we modified a commercially available radio-immunoassay for detection of this lymphokine in urine. the urinary levels of ifn gamma were compared in serial urine samples taken from six patients undergoing treatment with evans strain bcg and seven patients receiving intravesical mitomycin c/epirubicin. ifn gamma was detected consistently in response to bcg with levels reaching a peak (mean 67.1 u/ml., range 7.9 to 155.9 u/ml.) four to six hours post-instillation whereas after other intravesical agents no ifn gamma was detectable after seven of 13 instillations. after the remaining six instillations lower levels were detected (mean 7.4 u/ml., range 0.6 to 22.4 u/ml.). the difference in peak levels between the two groups was statistically significant (p less than 0.001 mann whitney u test). these results are further evidence of specific cellular immune activity in response to intravesical bcg therapy and suggest anti-tumour mechanisms similar to allograft rejection and autoimmunity.
mutations in the n-terminal coding region of the harpin protein hpa1 from xanthomonas oryzae cause loss of hypersensitive reaction induction in tobacco the hrp gene clusters of plant pathogenic bacteria control pathogenicity on their host plants and ability to elicit the hypersensitive reaction in resistant plants. some hrp gene products constitute elements of the type iii secretion system, by which effector proteins are exported and delivered into plant cells. here, we show that the hrpz gene product from the bean halo-blight pathogen, pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola (hrpz(psph)), is secreted in an hrp-dependent manner in p. syringae pv. phaseolicola and exported by the type iii secretion system in the mammalian pathogen yersinia enterocolitica. hrpz(psph) was found to associate stably with liposomes and synthetic bilayer membranes. under symmetric ionic conditions, addition of 2 nm of purified recombinant hrpz(psph) to the cis compartment of planar lipid bilayers provoked an ion current with a large unitary conductivity of 207 ps. hrpz(psph)-related proteins from p. syringae pv. tomato or syringae triggered ion currents similar to those stimulated by hrpz(psph). the hrpz(psph)-mediated ion-conducting pore was permeable for cations but did not mediate fluxes of cl-. such pore-forming activity may allow nutrient release and/or delivery of virulence factors during bacterial colonization of host plants.
does dietary folic acid supplementation in mouse ntd models affect neural tube development or gamete preference at fertilization? neural tube defects (ntd), including anencephaly and spina bifida, are a group of severe congenital abnormalities in which the future brain and/or spinal cord fail to close. in mice, ntd may result from genetic mutations or knockouts, or from exposure to teratogenic agents, several of which are known risk factors in humans. among the many mouse ntd models that have been identified to date, a number have been tested for possible primary prevention of ntd by exogenous agents, such as folic acid. in genetic ntd models such as cart1, splotch, cited2, and crooked tail, and ntd induced by teratogens including valproic acid and fumonisins, the incidence of defects is reduced by maternal folic acid supplementation. these folate‐responsive models provide an opportunity to investigate the possible mechanisms underlying prevention of ntd by folic acid in humans. in another group of mouse models, that includes curly tail, axial defects, and the ephrin‐a5 knockout, ntd are not preventable by folic acid, reflecting the situation in humans in which a subset of ntd appear resistant to folic acid therapy. in this group of mutants alternative preventive agents, including inositol and methionine, have been shown to be effective. overall, the data from mouse models suggests that a broad‐based in utero therapy may offer scope for prevention of a greater proportion of ntd than is currently possible. © 2005 wiley‐liss, inc.
allele-specific differences in transcriptome, mirnome, and mitochondrial function in two hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mouse models. objectives we investigated cardiac energetics in subjects with mutations in three different familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) disease genes, some of whom were nonpenetrant carriers without hypertrophy, using phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy.   background familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is caused by mutations in sarcomeric protein genes. the mechanism by which these mutant proteins cause disease is uncertain. a defect of myocyte contractility had been proposed, but in vitro studies of force generation have subsequently shown opposing results in different classes of mutation. an alternative hypothesis of "energy compromise" resulting from inefficient utilization of adenosine triphosphate (atp) has been suggested, but in vivo data in humans with genotyped hcm are lacking.   methods the cardiac phosphocreatine (pcr) to atp ratio was determined at rest in 31 patients harboring mutations in the genes for either beta-myosin heavy chain, cardiac troponin t, or myosin-binding protein c, and in 24 controls. transthoracic echocardiography was used to measure left ventricular (lv) dimensions and maximal wall thickness.   results the pcr/atp was reduced in the hcm subjects by 30% relative to controls (1.70 +/- 0.43 vs. 2.44 +/- 0.30; p < 0.001), and the reduction was of a similar magnitude in all three disease-gene groups. the pcr/atp was equally reduced in subjects with (n = 24) and without (n = 7) lv hypertrophy.   conclusions our data provide evidence of a bioenergetic deficit in genotype-confirmed hcm, which is present to a similar degree in three disease-gene groups. the presence of energetic abnormalities, even in those without hypertrophy, supports a proposed link between altered cardiac energetics and development of the disease phenotype.
improved production of genetically modified fetuses with homogeneous transgene expression after transgene integration site analysis and recloning in cattle. current applications of gene transfer in farm animals include the improvement of product quality and quantity, disease resistance, the production of valuable proteins in the mammary gland or other organs, the genetic modification of pigs for xenotransplantation and the generation of new animal models in cases where rodent models are not sufficient for studying the problem under evaluation. although dna microinjection into pronuclei of zygotes from various farm animal species has happened since 1985, the efficiency of this method is low. further drawbacks are related to the random integration process which may cause mosaicism, insertional mutations and varying expression due to position effects. sperm‐mediated gene transfer is not routinely established yet, although the mechanisms of binding and internalisation of dna by sperm cells is becoming increasingly clearer. new protocols for the use of retroviral vectors to infect metaphase ii oocytes which are subsequently fertilised resulted in efficient production of transgenic cattle. in spite of extensive efforts to establish pluripotent stem cells from farm animal species, no germ‐line competent cells have been reported in mammalian species other than mouse so far. however, recent success in cloning sheep, cattle, goats and pigs from cultured cells provides an alternative route for efficient and targeted genetic modifications of farm animals.
successful nonsurgical treatment of pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, pneumoperitoneum, pneumoretroperitoneum, and subcutaneous emphysema following ercp endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp)-related perforation occurs in 0.1-1.8% of patients after therapeutic ercp. it is a serious complication with a high mortality. however, little evidence exists in the medical literature and the optimal management remains unclear. this review aims to critically evaluate the optimal management of therapeutic ercp-related perforation.
spatiotemporal expression of notch receptors and ligands in developing mouse placenta. involvement of the notch signaling pathway in vascular development has been demonstrated by both gain- and loss-of-function mutations in humans, mice, and zebrafish. in zebrafish, notch signaling is required for arterial identity by suppressing the venous fate in developing artery cells. in mice, the notch4 receptor and the delta-like 4 (dll4) ligand are specifically expressed in arterial endothelial cells, suggesting a similar role. here we show that the dll4 ligand alone is required in a dosage-sensitive manner for normal arterial patterning in development. this implicates dll4 as the specific mammalian endothelial ligand for autocrine endothelial notch signaling, and suggests that dll4 may be a suitable target for intervention in arterial angiogenesis.
hepatitis c virus mediated changes in mirna-449a modulates inflammatory biomarker ykl40 through components of the notch signaling pathway persistent infections of hepatitis c virus (hcv) are known to be a major risk factor for causing hepatocellular carcinomas. nonstructural protein 3 (ns3) of hcv has serine protease and rna helicase domains, and is essential for the viral replication. further, ns3 is also considered to be involved in the development of hcv-induced hepatocellular carcinomas. in this report, we focus on the function of ns3 protein, and propose a novel possible molecular mechanism which is thought to be related to the tumorigenesis caused by the persistent infection of hcv. we identified srcap (snf2-related cbp activator protein) as a ns3 binding protein using yeast two-hybrid screening, and a co-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that ns3 can bind to srcap in mammalian cells. the results of a reporter gene assay using hes-1 promoter which is known to be a target gene activated by notch, indicate that ns3 and srcap cooperatively activate the hes-1 promoter in hep3b cells. in addition, we show in this report that also p400, which is known as a protein closely resembling srcap, would be targeted by ns3. ns3 exhibited binding activity also to the 1449–1808 region of p400 by a co-immunoprecipitation assay, and further the activation of the notch-mediated transcription of hes-1 promoter by ns3 decreased significantly by the combined silencing of srcap and p400 mrna using short hairpin rna. these results suggest that the hcv ns3 protein is involved in the activation of the notch-signaling pathway through the targeting to both srcap and p400.
reflex control of ipsilateral and contralateral paraspinal muscles the perioral reflex in response to innocuous mechanical stimulation of the lip vermilion was studied in 20 young and 20 older women. responses to stimuli at the right and left sides of both the upper and lower lips were recorded. results show significant specificity of response, especially for upper lip sites. reflex response at the site of stimulation was greatest in amplitude and shortest in latency, followed by response at sites ipsilateral to the site of stimulation. younger subjects showed greater localizing tendency than older subjects. stimulation was significantly less likely to produce a reflex response in the older group. when reflex responses did occur, they were significantly lower in amplitude and longer in latency than the responses of the younger group. nonetheless, reflex responses were common in both groups, with responses at the site of stimulation occurring 78% of the time in older women and 90% of the time in younger women. every participant showed at least one reflex response to lip stimulation. results suggest decreasing complexity of synaptic drive to the perioral system in old age but also show that reflexive response does not deteriorate completely, remaining an available element for motor control in normal older women.
cep290 interacts with the centriolar satellite component pcm-1 and is required for rab8 localization to the primary cilium. bbs4 is one of several proteins that cause bardet-biedl syndrome (bbs), a multisystemic disorder of genetic and clinical complexity. here we show that bbs4 localizes to the centriolar satellites of centrosomes and basal bodies of primary cilia, where it functions as an adaptor of the p150glued subunit of the dynein transport machinery to recruit pcm1 (pericentriolar material 1 protein) and its associated cargo to the satellites. silencing of bbs4 induces pcm1 mislocalization and concomitant deanchoring of centrosomal microtubules, arrest in cell division and apoptotic cell death. expression of two truncated forms of bbs4 that are similar to those found in some individuals with bbs had a similar effect on pcm1 and microtubules. our findings indicate that defective targeting or anchoring of pericentriolar proteins and microtubule disorganization contribute to the bbs phenotype and provide new insights into possible causes of familial obesity, diabetes and retinal degeneration.

the influence of regional health system characteristics on the surgical management and receipt of post operative radiation therapy for glioblastoma multiforme purpose to evaluate trends in the geographic distribution of the radiation oncology (ro) workforce.   methods and materials we used the 1995 and 2007 versions of the area resource file to map the ratio of ro to the population aged 65 years or older (ror) within different health service areas (hsa) within the united states. we used regression analysis to find associations between population variables and 2007 ror. we calculated gini coefficients for ror to assess the evenness of ro distribution and compared that with primary care physicians and total physicians.   results there was a 24% increase in the ro workforce from 1995 to 2007. the overall growth in the ro workforce was less than that of primary care or the overall physician workforce. the mean ror among hsas increased by more than one radiation oncologist per 100,000 people aged 65 years or older, from 5.08 per 100,000 to 6.16 per 100,000. however, there remained consistent geographic variability concerning ro distribution, specifically affecting the non-metropolitan hsas. regression analysis found higher ror in hsas that possessed higher education (p = 0.001), higher income (p < 0.001), lower unemployment rates (p < 0.001), and higher minority population (p = 0.022). gini coefficients showed ro distribution less even than for both primary care physicians and total physicians (0.326 compared with 0.196 and 0.292, respectively).   conclusions despite a modest growth in the ro workforce, there exists persistent geographic maldistribution of radiation oncologists allocated along socioeconomic and racial lines. to solve problems surrounding the ro workforce, issues concerning both gross numbers and geographic distribution must be addressed.
trim28 and interacting krab-znfs control self-renewal of human pluripotent stem cells through epigenetic repression of pro-differentiation genes reverse transcription-derived sequences account for at least half of the human genome. although these retroelements are formidable motors of evolution, they can occasionally cause disease, and accordingly are inactivated during early embryogenesis through epigenetic mechanisms. in the mouse, at least for endogenous retroviruses, important mediators of this process are the tetrapod-specific krab-containing zinc finger proteins (krab-zfps) and their cofactor trim28. the present study demonstrates that krab/trim28-mediated regulation is responsible for controlling a very broad range of human-specific endogenous retroelements (eres) in human embryonic stem (es) cells and that it exerts, as a consequence, a marked effect on the transcriptional dynamics of these cells. it further reveals reciprocal dependence between trim28 recruitment at specific families of eres and dna methylation. it finally points to the importance of persistent trim28-mediated control of ere transcriptional impact beyond their presumed inactivation by dna methylation.
harmonia axyridis (coleoptera: coccinellidae) in asia: a re-examination of the native range and invasion to southeastern kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan harmonia axyridis (pallas, 1773) (coleoptera: coccinellidae) is a ladybird beetle native to temperate and subtropical parts of asia. since 1916 populations of this species have been introduced throughout the world, either deliberately, or by accident through international transport. harmonia axyridis was originally released as a classical biological control agent of aphid and coccid pests in orchards and forests, but since 1994 it is also available as a commercial product for augmentative control in field and greenhouse crops. it is a very voracious and effective natural enemy of aphids, psyllids and coccids in various agricultural and horticultural habitats and forests. during the past 20 years, however, it has successfully invaded non-target habitats in north america (since 1988), europe (1999) and south america (2001) respectively in a short period of time, attacking a wide range of non-pest species in different insect orders. becoming part of the agricultural commercial pathway, it is prone to being introduced into large areas across the world by accident. we use the climex programme (v2) to predict the potential geographical distribution of h. axyridis by means of matching the climate of its region of origin with other regions in the world and taking in account biological characteristics of the species. establishment and spread seem likely in many regions across the world, including those areas which h. axyridis has already invaded (temperate europe, north america). based on the climex prediction a large part of mediterranean europe, south america, africa, australia and new zealand seem highly suitable for long-term survival of h. axyridis as well. in addition we evaluate climex as a strategic tool for estimating establishment potential as part of an environmental risk assessment procedure for biological control agents we discuss biological and ecological aspects necessary to fine-tune its establishment and spread in areas after it has been introduced.
design, data, and theory regarding a digital hand inclinometer: a portable device for studying slant perception a dramatic failure of orientation constancy is documented in the perception of downhill slopes. contrary to naïve expectation, steep downhill slopes look shallower from the edge than they do from back from the edge. three experiments document and quantify this failure of constancy for real and virtual surfaces using a variety of dependent measures. two additional studies document overestimation of both non-visually perceived head pitch and perceived gaze declination. a model of orientation constancy failure is fit to the data that combine exaggerations in perceived gaze declination with exaggerated scaling of perceived optical slant. these findings support a functional scale-expansion model of error in slope perception.

descriptor ensemble: an unsupervised approach to descriptor fusion in the homography space in this paper, we compare the performance of descriptors computed for local interest regions, as, for example, extracted by the harris-affine detector [mikolajczyk, k and schmid, c, 2004]. many different descriptors have been proposed in the literature. it is unclear which descriptors are more appropriate and how their performance depends on the interest region detector. the descriptors should be distinctive and at the same time robust to changes in viewing conditions as well as to errors of the detector. our evaluation uses as criterion recall with respect to precision and is carried out for different image transformations. we compare shape context [belongie, s, et al., april 2002], steerable filters [freeman, w and adelson, e, setp. 1991], pca-sift [ke, y and sukthankar, r, 2004], differential invariants [koenderink, j and van doorn, a, 1987], spin images [lazebnik, s, et al., 2003], sift [lowe, d. g., 1999], complex filters [schaffalitzky, f and zisserman, a, 2002], moment invariants [van gool, l, et al., 1996], and cross-correlation for different types of interest regions. we also propose an extension of the sift descriptor and show that it outperforms the original method. furthermore, we observe that the ranking of the descriptors is mostly independent of the interest region detector and that the sift-based descriptors perform best. moments and steerable filters show the best performance among the low dimensional descriptors.
rsk promotes prostate cancer progression in bone through ing3, ckap2, and ptk6-mediated cell survival background proteins that are required for anchorage-independent survival of tumor cells represent attractive targets for therapeutic intervention since this property is believed to be critical for survival of tumor cells displaced from their natural niches. anchorage-independent survival is induced by growth factor receptor hyperactivation in many cell types. we aimed to identify molecules that critically regulate igf-1-induced anchorage-independent survival. methods and results we conducted a high-throughput sirna screen and identified ptk6 as a critical component of igf-1 receptor (igf-1r)-induced anchorage-independent survival of mammary epithelial cells. ptk6 downregulation induces apoptosis of breast and ovarian cancer cells deprived of matrix attachment, whereas its overexpression enhances survival. reverse-phase protein arrays and subsequent analyses revealed that ptk6 forms a complex with igf-1r and the adaptor protein irs-1, and modulates anchorage-independent survival by regulating igf-1r expression and phosphorylation. ptk6 is highly expressed not only in the previously reported her2+ breast cancer subtype, but also in high grade er+, luminal b tumors and high expression is associated with adverse outcomes. conclusions these findings highlight ptk6 as a critical regulator of anchorage-independent survival of breast and ovarian tumor cells via modulation of igf-1 receptor signaling, thus supporting ptk6 as a potential therapeutic target for multiple tumor types. the combined genomic and proteomic approaches in this report provide an effective strategy for identifying oncogenes and their mechanism of action.
transcriptome sequencing and expression analysis of cadmium (cd) transport and detoxification related genes in cd-accumulating salix integra heavy metal (hm)-accumulating herbaceous and woody plants are employed for phytoremediation. to develop improved strategies for enhancing phytoremediation efficiency, knowledge of the microstructural, physiological and molecular responses underlying hm-accumulation is required. here we review the progress in understanding the structural, physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying hm uptake, transport, sequestration and detoxification, as well as the regulation of these processes by signal transduction in response to hm exposure. the significance of genetic engineering for enhancing phytoremediation efficiency is also discussed. in herbaceous plants, hms are taken up by roots and transported into the root cells via transmembrane carriers for nutritional ions. the hms absorbed by root cells can be further translocated to the xylem vessels and unloaded into the xylem sap, thereby reaching the aerial parts of plants. hms can be sequestered in the cell walls, vacuoles and the golgi apparatuses. plant roots initially perceive hm stress and trigger the signal transduction, thereby mediating changes at the molecular, physiological, and microstructural level. signaling molecules such as phytohormones, reactive oxygen species (ros) and nitric oxide (no), modulate plant responses to hms via differentially expressed genes, activation of the antioxidative system and coordinated cross talk among different signaling molecules. a number of genes participated in hm uptake, transport, sequestration and detoxification have been functionally characterized and transformed to target plants for enhancing phytoremediation efficiency. fast growing woody plants hold an advantage over herbaceous plants for phytoremediation in terms of accumulation of high hm-amounts in their large biomass. presumably, woody plants accumulate hms using similar mechanisms as herbaceous counterparts, but the processes of hm accumulation and signal transduction can be more complex in woody plants.
novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of candida infections: the potential of immunotherapy. background nosocomial bloodstream infections (bsis) are important causes of morbidity and mortality in the united states.   methods data from a nationwide, concurrent surveillance study (surveillance and control of pathogens of epidemiological importance [scope]) were used to examine the secular trends in the epidemiology and microbiology of nosocomial bsis.   results our study detected 24,179 cases of nosocomial bsi in 49 us hospitals over a 7-year period from march 1995 through september 2002 (60 cases per 10,000 hospital admissions). eighty-seven percent of bsis were monomicrobial. gram-positive organisms caused 65% of these bsis, gram-negative organisms caused 25%, and fungi caused 9.5%. the crude mortality rate was 27%. the most-common organisms causing bsis were coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (31% of isolates), staphylococcus aureus (20%), enterococci (9%), and candida species (9%). the mean interval between admission and infection was 13 days for infection with escherichia coli, 16 days for s. aureus, 22 days for candida species and klebsiella species, 23 days for enterococci, and 26 days for acinetobacter species. cons, pseudomonas species, enterobacter species, serratia species, and acinetobacter species were more likely to cause infections in patients in intensive care units (p<.001). in neutropenic patients, infections with candida species, enterococci, and viridans group streptococci were significantly more common. the proportion of s. aureus isolates with methicillin resistance increased from 22% in 1995 to 57% in 2001 (p<.001, trend analysis). vancomycin resistance was seen in 2% of enterococcus faecalis isolates and in 60% of enterococcus faecium isolates.   conclusion in this study, one of the largest multicenter studies performed to date, we found that the proportion of nosocomial bsis due to antibiotic-resistant organisms is increasing in us hospitals.
sparc/osteonectin, an endogenous mechanism for targeting albumin to the blood–cerebrospinal fluid interface during brain development osteonectin (sparc, culture shock protein, bm-40) is a widely distributed glycoprotein which binds calcium and several extracellular matrix proteins, including interstitial collagens and thrombospondin, but whose physiologic role remains undefined. in the present studies, we have demonstrated that immunoreactive osteonectin is present in the distal cortical tubule and medullary tubules of murine kidney. we surveyed the renal epithelial cell lines llc-pk1, mdck, and ok for the expression of mrna encoding osteonectin. we found that osteonectin mrna is expressed by llc-pk1 and ok cells but not by mdck cells, as well as by adult kidney from several species. calcitonin and vasopressin, agents which increase camp in these cells, were found to decrease steady-state osteonectin mrna concentrations. we found that llc-pk1 cells produced osteonectin protein, that the protein was localized to intracellular granules, and that the protein bound hydroxyapatite in vitro. pulse-chase analysis revealed that osteonectin was secreted from the cell layer to the medium after a lag time of four to six hours and was secreted preferentially from the basolateral domain of the cell. the preferential secretion of the calcium-binding protein osteonectin from the renal epithelial cell is consistent with several possible functions, including a structural extracellular matrix protein, a participant in transepithelial ion transport, and an inhibitor of extracellular calcification.
front-face fluorescence spectroscopy as a tool to classify seven bovine muscles according to their chemical and rheological characteristics. this paper reports the potential of synchronous front-face fluorescence spectroscopy in the characterization at the molecular level of milk changes during mild heating from 4 to 50 °c and acidification in the ph range of 6.8 to 5.1. synchronous fluorescence spectra were collected in the 250–550 nm excitation wavelength range using offsets of 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, and 240 nm between excitation and emission monochromators. the potential of parallel factor (parafac) analysis in the decomposition of the whole synchronous fluorescence data set into the contribution of each of the fluorescent compounds present in milk has been investigated for heating and acidification data sets. models were fitted from 1 to 7 components. considering the core consistency values, parafac models with three components have been considered. the first three components explained 94.43% and 94.13% of the total variance for heating and acidification data sets, respectively. the loading profiles of the first and second components derived from parafac analysis performed on heating and acidification data sets corresponded quite well with the characteristics of tryptophan and vitamin a fluorescence spectra, respectively. the third component corresponded to the riboflavin fluorescence spectrum. considering the heating experiment, the profile of the concentration mode for the second component showed large variations according to the temperature, which were assigned to the melting of triglycerides between 4 and 50 °c. for the acidification experiment, drastic changes in the concentration modes of the three components were observed for ph below 5.6, in agreement with structural changes in casein micelles.
single-center outcome analysis comparing reintervention rates of surgical arterioplasty with stenting for branch pulmonary artery stenosis in a pediatric population stenosis or discontinuity of the pulmonary arteries associated with congenital cardiac defects was repaired in 12 patients, in conjunction with the blalock-taussig shunt. this approach was based on the following concepts: (1) the shunted blood is more uniformly distributed to both lungs, which avoids predominance of flow to the ipsilateral lung and long-term pulmonary vascular damage; (2) because adequate blood flow is maintained, the contralateral lung growth will be near normal; (3) the possibility of future surgical correction is enhanced. the ages of the patients ranged from 2 to 24 months. five had a primary diagnosis of tetralogy of fallot, three had double outlet of the right ventricle, three had single ventricle, and one had a truncus type anomaly. all operations were performed without cardiopulmonary bypass. dilation of the stenotic segment was performed in two patients, enlargement of the stenotic segment in three, and resection of the segment and end-to-end anastomosis in four. nonconfluent pulmonary arteries were corrected in three patients. in one, the stenotic segment was resected and an anastomosis was made between the left pulmonary artery and pulmonary trunk. in another patient, a segment of the right subclavian artery was interposed between the pulmonary trunk and intrahilar left pulmonary artery. in the third patient, the right pulmonary artery was disconnected from the aorta and a tube was interposed between the right and left pulmonary arteries. there were no intraoperative or late deaths, and postoperative angiographic evaluations were satisfactory. we believe that in infants needing a blalock-taussig shunt the pulmonary artery anomalies, if present, should be corrected simultaneously.
a genome-wide survey of hd-zip genes in rice and analysis of drought-responsive family members hahb-4 is a member of the helianthusannuus (sunflower) subfamily i of hd-zip proteins that is transcriptionally regulated by water availability and abscisic acid. transgenic arabidopsis thaliana plants overexpressing this transcription factor (tf) exhibit a characteristic phenotype that includes a strong tolerance to water stress. here we show that this tf is a new component of ethylene signalling pathways, and that it induces a marked delay in senescence. plants overexpressing hahb-4 are less sensitive to external ethylene, enter the senescence pathway later and do not show the typical triple response. furthermore, transgenic plants expressing this gene under the control of its own inducible promoter showed an inverse correlation between ethylene sensitivity and hahb-4 levels. potential targets of hahb-4 were identified by comparing the transcriptome of hahb-4-transformed and wild-type plants using microarrays and quantitative rt-pcr. expression of this tf has a major repressive effect on genes related to ethylene synthesis, such as aco and sam, and on genes related to ethylene signalling, such as erf2 and erf5. expression studies in sunflower indicate that hahb-4 transcript levels are elevated in mature/senescent leaves. expression of hahb-4 is induced by ethylene, concomitantly with several genes homologous to the targets identified in the transcriptome analysis (ha-acoa and ha-acob). transient transformation of sunflower leaves demonstrated the action of hahb-4 in the regulation of ethylene-related genes. we propose that hahb-4 is involved in a novel conserved mechanism related to ethylene-mediated senescence that functions to improve desiccation tolerance.
targeted degradation of pseudo-response regulator5 by an scfztl complex regulates clock function and photomorphogenesis in arabidopsis thaliana[w] in arabidopsis thaliana, the transcripts of the aprr1/toc1 family genes each start accumulating after dawn rhythmically and one after another at intervals in the order of aprr9-->aprr7-->aprr5-->aprr3-->aprr1/toc1 under continuous light. except for the well-characterized aprr1/toc1, however, no evidence has been provided that other aprr1/toc1 family genes are indeed implicated in the mechanisms underlying circadian rhythms. we here attempted to provide such evidence by characterizing transgenic plants that constitutively express the aprr5 gene. the resulting aprr5-overexpressing (aprr5-ox) plants showed intriguing properties with regard to not only circadian rhythms, but also control of flowering time and light response. first, the aberrant expression of aprr5 in such transgenic plants resulted in a characteristic phenotype with regard to transcriptional events, in which free-running rhythms were considerably altered for certain circadian-regulated genes, including cca1, lhy, aprr1/toc1, other aprr1/toc1 members, gi and cab2, although each rhythm was clearly sustained even after plants were transferred to continuous light. with regard to biological events, aprr5-ox plants flowered much earlier than wild-type plants, more or less, in a manner independent of photoperiodicity (or under short-day conditions). furthermore, aprr5-ox plants showed an srl (short-hypocotyls under red light) phenotype that is indicative of hypersensitiveness to red light in early photomorphogenesis. both aprr1-ox and aprr9-ox plants also showed the same phenotype. therefore, aprr5 (together with aprr1/toc1 and aprr9) must be taken into consideration for a better understanding of the molecular links between circadian rhythms, control of flowering time through the photoperiodic long-day pathway, and also light signaling-controlled plant development.
emotional reactivity and its impact on neural circuitry for attention–emotion interaction in childhood and adolescence objective to examine the relation between specific frontostriatal structures (prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia) and response inhibition deficits observed in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd).   method children with adhd and age-matched normal controls were scanned using magnetic resonance imaging (mri) and tested on three response inhibition tasks. behavioral performance was correlated with mri-based anatomical measures of frontostriatal circuitry (prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia) implicated in adhd.   results first, significant differences in performance by children with adhd and normal volunteers were observed on all three response inhibition tasks. second, performance on these tasks correlated only with those anatomical measures of frontostriatal circuitry observed to be abnormal in children with adhd (e.g., the region of the prefrontal cortex, caudate, and globus pallidus, but not the putamen) in the authors' previous study. third, significant correlations between task performance and anatomical measures of the prefrontal cortex and caudate nuclei were predominantly in the right hemisphere, supporting a role of right frontostriatal circuitry in response inhibition and adhd.   conclusion the data suggest a role of the right prefrontal cortex in suppressing responses to salient, but otherwise irrelevant events while the basal ganglia appear to be involved in executing these behavioral responses.
salesforce behavioural performance of accounts relationship managers (arms) in uganda's commercial banks: a qualitative analysis we introduce social networks theory and methods as a way of understanding mentoring in the current career context. we iirst introduce a typology of “developmental networks” using core concepts from social networks theory—network diversity and tie strength—to view mentoring as a multiple relationship phenomenon. we then propose a framework illustrating factors that shape developmental network structures and offer propositions focusing on the developmental consequences for individuals having different types of developmental networks in their careers. we conclude with strategies both for testing our propositions and for researching multiple developmental relationships further.
biomedical factors associated with hospitalization of older adults: the bambuí health and aging study (bhas). background the aims of the study were to describe the pattern of hospital utilization (acute and mental health sectors) of the paisley-renfrew midspan cohort and assess the influence of biological, behavioural and social 'risk factors' (established at the time of screening) on subsequent hospital admissions.   method a cohort analysis was carried out in paisley and renfrew, two post-industrial towns in west central scotland. this used a linked data set covering a 23 year follow-up period to combine original 'risk'-related data with subsequent routine hospital admissions data. the subjects were 8349 women and 7057 men, aged 45-64 in the early to mid-1970s, and representing approximately 80 per cent of the eligible population. the main outcome measures were patterns of hospital utilization (acute and mental health sectors), 'any acute hospital admission', 'a serious acute hospital admission' and 'death' (relative risks of each outcome were calculated for all risk factors).   results the following patterns of hospital utilization were found. only 5 per cent experienced a mental health admission but mean stay was long (265 bed days per cohort member admitted). in contrast, 79 per cent experienced at least one acute hospital stay. the age-specific proportions of cohort members requiring admission increased over time but the growth in acute episodes was even higher (suggesting increasing rates of multiple admission). for non-survivors, 42 per cent of all acute episodes (55 per cent of bed days) took place during the 12 months before death. analysis of risk factors (using cox's proportional hazards model) of 'any admission' and 'a serious admission' showed forced expiratory volume (fev1), age, sex, smoking status, blood pressure, blood sugar, body mass index, cholesterol and deprivation category to be important predictors.   conclusions despite the desirability of alternative settings of care for the chronically ill and dying, a high proportion of hospital bed days were required near the time of death. the absolute size of the demand for hospital services within the cohort was strikingly large and increasing over time. strategies to address the tide of rising admissions will have to confront the increasing proportion of individuals requiring admission as well as the growth in multiple admissions. those who were at higher risk of admission were the older members of the cohort (especially men), those with low fev1, smokers, those who were underweight or obese, the small number with abnormal levels of blood sugar, those with high blood pressure and those who lived in the most deprived areas. thus, programmes which affect these determinants of ill health may be useful in reducing age-specific admission rates.
expanded, but not regulated: ambiguity in home-care policy in ireland. this article describes and evaluates cash-for-care programmes for older people in four european countries, namely home-care grants in ireland, direct payments in the united kingdom (england), service vouchers in finland and personal budgets in the netherlands. the purpose is to raise understanding of the background and reasons for the introduction of cash-for-care programmes and their impact on the countries' care regimes. it is argued that while the motives for introducing cash-for-care programmes in the four countries are similar, namely to promote choice and autonomy, to plug gaps in existing provision, to create jobs, and to promote efficiency, cost savings and domiciliary care, the relative importance of these goals varies. current cash-for-care programmes have comparatively modest coverage as compared with direct service provision and provide no more than an optional, supplementary source of care in three of the studied countries. cash-for-care schemes have not radically transformed the care regimes in finland, the netherlands or the united kingdom. in ireland, however, the restricted availability of alternative forms of formal service provision means that the expansion of cash-for-care might shift care provision significantly towards private provision and financing.
purification and characterization of a serine alkaline protease from bacillus clausii gmbae 42 an extracellular alkaline serine protease (called dhap), produced by a bacillus pumilus strain, demonstrates significant dehairing function. this protease is purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography, ion exchange, and gel filtration. dhap had a pi of 9.0 and a molecular weight of approximately 32,000 dalton. it shows maximal activity at ph 10 and with a temperature of 55°c; the enzyme activity can be completely inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pmsf) and diisopropyl fluorophosphates (dfp). the first 20 amino acid residues of the purified dhap have been determined with a sequence of aqtvpygipqikapavhaqg. alignment of this sequence with other alkaline protease demonstrates its high homology with protease from another b. pumilus strain.
alcohol consumption and risky sexual behavior among persons attending alcohol consumption venues in gaborone, botswana we tested 2 competing theories about the effects of alcohol on intentions to engage in risky behavior. disinhibition predicts that intoxicated people will exhibit risky behavior regardless of environmental cues, whereas alcohol myopia (c. m. steele & r. a. josephs, 1990) predicts that intoxicated people will be more or less likely to exhibit risky behavior, depending on the cues provided. in 4 studies, we found an interaction between intoxication and cue type. when impelling cues were present, intoxicated people reported greater intentions to have unprotected sex than did sober people. when subtle inhibiting cues were present, intoxicated and sober people reported equally cautious intentions (studies 1-3). when strong inhibiting cues were present, intoxicated people reported more prudent intentions than did sober people (study 4). we suggest that alcohol myopia provides a more comprehensive account of the effects of alcohol than does disinhibition.
effective attack models for shilling item-based collaborative filtering systems web usage mining has recently attracted attention as a viable framework for extracting useful access pattern information, such as user profiles, from massive amounts of web log data for the purpose of web site personalization and organization. these efforts have relied mainly on clustering or association rule discovery as the enabling data mining technologies. typically, data mining has to be completely re-applied periodically and offline on newly generated web server logs in order to keep the discovered knowledge up to date. in addition to difficulty to scale and adapt in the face of large data and continuously evolving patterns, most clustering techniques, such as the majority of kmeans variants, also suffer from one or more of the following limitations: requirement of the specification of the correct number of clusters/profiles in advance, sensitivity to initialization, sensitivity to the presence of noise and outliers in the data, and unsuitability for sparse data sets. hence, there is a crucial need for scalable, noise insensitive, initialization independent techniques that can continuously discover possibly evolving web user profiles without any stoppages or reconfigurations. in this paper, we propose a new scalable clustering methodology that gleams inspiration from the natural immune system to be able to continuously learn and adapt to new incoming patterns. the web server plays the role of the human body, and the incoming requests play the role of foreign antigens/bacteria/viruses that need to be detected by the proposed immune based clustering technique. hence, our clustering algorithm plays the role of the cognitive agent of an artificial immune system, whose goal is to continuously perform an intelligent organization of the incoming noisy data into clusters. our approach exhibits superior learning abilities, while at the same time, requiring modest memory and computational costs. like the natural immune system, the strongest advantage of immune based learning compared to current approaches is expected to be its ease of adaptation to the dynamic environment that characterizes several applications, particularly in mining data streams. we illustrate the ability of the proposed approach in mining user profiles from web clickstream data in a single pass under different usage trend sequencing scenarios.
differences in helicobacter pylori caga tyrosine phosphorylation motif patterns between western and east asian strains, and influences on interleukin-8 secretion. helicobacter pylori is a causative agent of gastritis and peptic ulcer. caga+h. pylori strains are more virulent than caga− strains and are associated with gastric carcinoma. the caga gene product, caga, is injected by the bacterium into gastric epithelial cells and subsequently undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation. the phosphorylated caga specifically binds shp-2 phosphatase, activates the phosphatase activity, and thereby induces morphological transformation of cells. caga proteins of most western h. pylori isolates have a 34-amino acid sequence that variably repeats among different strains. here, we show that the repeat sequence contains a tyrosine phosphorylation site. caga proteins having more repeats were found to undergo greater tyrosine phosphorylation, to exhibit increased shp-2 binding, and to induce greater morphological changes. in contrast, predominant caga proteins specified by h. pylori strains isolated in east asia, where gastric carcinoma is prevalent, had a distinct tyrosine phosphorylation sequence at the region corresponding to the repeat sequence of western caga. this east asian-specific sequence conferred stronger shp-2 binding and morphologically transforming activities to western caga. finally, a critical amino acid residue that determines shp-2 binding activity among different caga proteins was identified. our results indicate that the potential of individual caga to perturb host-cell functions is determined by the degree of shp-2 binding activity, which depends in turn on the number and sequences of tyrosine phosphorylation sites. the presence of distinctly structured caga proteins in western and east asian h. pylori isolates may underlie the strikingly different incidences of gastric carcinoma in these two geographic areas.
let the tree bloom: scalable opportunistic routing with orpl traditionally, routing in wireless sensor networks consists of two steps: first, the routing protocol selects a next hop, and, second, the mac protocol waits for the intended destination to wake up and receive the data. this design makes it difficult to adapt to link dynamics and introduces delays while waiting for the next hop to wake up. in this paper we introduce orw, a practical opportunistic routing scheme for wireless sensor networks. in a duty-cycled setting, packets are addressed to sets of potential receivers and forwarded by the neighbor that wakes up first and successfully receives the packet. this reduces delay and energy consumption by utilizing all neighbors as potential forwarders. furthermore, this increases resilience to wireless link dynamics by exploiting spatial diversity. our results show that orw reduces radio duty-cycles on average by 50% (up to 90% on individual nodes) and delays by 30% to 90% when compared to the state of the art.
face recognition using 2.5d shape information previous work has demonstrated that the image variation of many objects (human faces in particular) under variable lighting can be effectively modeled by low-dimensional linear spaces, even when there are multiple light sources and shadowing. basis images spanning this space are usually obtained in one of three ways: a large set of images of the object under different lighting conditions is acquired, and principal component analysis (pca) is used to estimate a subspace. alternatively, synthetic images are rendered from a 3d model (perhaps reconstructed from images) under point sources and, again, pca is used to estimate a subspace. finally, images rendered from a 3d model under diffuse lighting based on spherical harmonics are directly used as basis images. in this paper, we show how to arrange physical lighting so that the acquired images of each object can be directly used as the basis vectors of a low-dimensional linear space and that this subspace is close to those acquired by the other methods. more specifically, there exist configurations of k point light source directions, with k typically ranging from 5 to 9, such that, by taking k images of an object under these single sources, the resulting subspace is an effective representation for recognition under a wide range of lighting conditions. since the subspace is generated directly from real images, potentially complex and/or brittle intermediate steps such as 3d reconstruction can be completely avoided; nor is it necessary to acquire large numbers of training images or to physically construct complex diffuse (harmonic) light fields. we validate the use of subspaces constructed in this fashion within the context of face recognition.
titan cell production in cryptococcus neoformans reshapes the cell wall and capsule composition during infection the pathogenesis of cryptococcus neoformans infection has been studied extensively with respect to inflammatory and pathological changes, but very little information is available regarding the morphology of yeast cells during the course of infection. electron microscopy of cryptococcus neoformans in murine pulmonary infection revealed increased cell wall thickness with time, but this difference was only partially accounted for by increases in cell diameter. cell walls of melanized cells were thicker than those of nonmelanized cells 2 h after infection, and the cell wall of yeast became blacker with time, suggesting that melanization contributes to the increased cell wall thickness. heterogeneous cell populations emerged, with the appearance of giant forms. while for c. neoformans atcc strain 24067 (serotype d) the full spectrum of cell sizes were observed, for strains h99 (serotype a) and 3501 (serotype d) cells were divisible into two populations, giant and micro forms. in contrast to cellular heterogeneity, the epitope recognized by a protective mab on the capsular glucuronoxylomannan (gxm) was found at all times of infection. immunoelectron microscopy using mabs to gxm demonstrated reactivity with intracellular structures, suggesting that synthesis of capsular polysaccharide occurs, at least in part, in the cytoplasm. in summary, the results indicate that: (i) the infection is dynamic with respect to yeast cell morphology; (ii) giant cell forms arise in tissue during the course of infection; (iii) cell walls blacken and thicken during the course of infection, consistent with melanin synthesis during infection; and (iv) gxm epitopes are found in the capsule, cell wall and cytoplasm, consistent with intracellular polysaccharide synthesis. the results indicate that the population of c. neoformans cells in tissue is in a highly dynamic state, implying that the immune system must confront cells with varying characteristics during the course of infection.
the distal limb environment regulates myod accumulation and muscle differentiation in mouse-chick chimaeric limbs. we have utilized a key biochemical determinant of muscle fiber type, myosin isoform expression, to investigate the initial developmental program of future fast and slow skeletal muscle fibers. we examined myosin heavy chain (hc) phenotype from the onset of myogenesis in the limb bud muscle masses of the chick embryo through the differentiation of individual fast and slow muscle masses, as well as in newly formed myotubes generated in adult muscle by weight overload. myosin hc isoform expression was analyzed by immunofluorescence localization with a battery of anti-myosin antibodies and by electrophoretic separation with sds-page. results showed that the initial myosin phenotype in all skeletal muscle cells formed during the embryonic period (until at least 8 days in ovo) consisted of expression of a myosin hc which shares antigenic and electrophoretic migratory properties with ventricular myosin and a distinct myosin hc which shares antigenic and electrophoretic migratory properties with fast skeletal isomyosin. similar results were observed in newly formed myotubes in adult muscle. future fast and slow muscle fibers could only be discriminated from each other in developing limb bud muscles by the onset of expression of slow skeletal myosin hc at 6 days in ovo. slow skeletal myosin hc was expressed only in myotubes which became slow fibers. these findings suggest that the initial commitment of skeletal muscle progenitor cells is to a common skeletal muscle lineage and that commitment to a fiber-specific lineage may not occur until after localization of myogenic cells in appropriate premuscle masses. thus, the process of localization, or events which occur soon thereafter, may be involved in determining fiber type.
salvage brachytherapy in prostate local recurrence after radiation therapy: predicting factors for control and toxicity purpose we describe the treatment outcome in 17 patients who received combined salvage brachytherapy and short-term androgen deprivation therapy for local prostate cancer relapse after prior external beam irradiation.   materials and methods median patient age was 68 years. local relapse after external beam irradiation was confirmed by biopsy. median prostate specific antigen at local relapse was 4.7 ng/ml. five of the 17 patients were enrolled in a protocol combining androgen deprivation therapy with brachytherapy and the remaining men were treated off protocol. all patients received neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy for a median of 3 months, followed by ultrasound guided brachytherapy using 125i in 9 and 103pd seeds in 8. five patients also received adjuvant leuprolide for a median of 6 months. biochemical failure was defined using the american society for therapeutic radiology and oncology definition. toxicity was graded with a modified radiation therapy oncology group scale.   results median followup was 44 months. the actuarial 4-year biochemical control rate was 75%. three patients died of intercurrent diseases. no prostate cancer mortality or local failure had occurred at last followup. one patient had bone metastasis. no clinical or treatment factor was associated with biochemical control. grade 3 and 4 genitourinary toxicity developed in 7 (41%) and 1 patients (6%), respectively. grade 2 and 3 gastrointestinal toxicity occurred in 5 (29%) and 1 patients (6%), respectively.   conclusions our series suggests that salvage brachytherapy and short-term androgen deprivation therapy can achieve biochemical control in select patients with local relapse after prior external beam irradiation. the major side effects are urinary complications, including grade 3 and 4 complications in 41% and 6% of cases, respectively.
in vivo rna interference screens identify regulators of antiviral cd4(+) and cd8(+) t cell differentiation. t follicular helper cell differentiation when b cells respond to an infection, they often require help from cd4+ t cells to mount a proper response. it is thought that a subset of cd4+ effector t cells, called t follicular helper cells (tfh), performs this function. several subsets of effector cd4+ t cells arise, depending on the type of infection, which have distinct transcriptional programs driving their differentiation. whether this is also the case for tfh cells has not been clear (see the perspective by awasthi and kuchroo). nurieva et al. (p. 1001, published online 23 july) and johnston et al. (p. 1006; published online 16 july) now demonstrate that the transcription factor bcl6 is both necessary and sufficient for tfh differentiation and subsequent b cell–mediated immunity, suggesting that it is a master regulator of this lineage. johnston et al. also show that expression of bcl6 and the transcription factor, blimp-1, are reciprocally regulated in tfh cells and that, when ectopically expressed, blimp-1 inhibits tfh development. the transcription factors that regulate follicular t helper cell differentiation are identified. effective b cell–mediated immunity and antibody responses often require help from cd4+ t cells. it is thought that a distinct cd4+ effector t cell subset, called t follicular helper cells (tfh), provides this help; however, the molecular requirements for tfh differentiation are unknown. we found that expression of the transcription factor bcl6 in cd4+ t cells is both necessary and sufficient for in vivo tfh differentiation and t cell help to b cells in mice. in contrast, the transcription factor blimp-1, an antagonist of bcl6, inhibits tfh differentiation and help, thereby preventing b cell germinal center and antibody responses. these findings demonstrate that tfh cells are required for proper b cell responses in vivo and that bcl6 and blimp-1 play central but opposing roles in tfh differentiation.
annual and diurnal variations of gaseous and particulate pollutants in 31 provincial capital cities based on in situ air quality monitoring data from china national environmental monitoring center. o3 and pm2.5 were introduced into the newly revised air quality standard system in february 2012, representing a milestone in the history of air pollution control, and china's urban air quality will be evaluated using six factors (so2, no2, o3, co, pm2.5 and pm10) from the beginning of 2013. to achieve the new air quality standard, it is extremely important to have a primary understanding of the current pollution status in various cities. the spatial and temporal variations of the air pollutants were investigated in 26 pilot cities in china from august 2011 to february 2012, just before the new standard was executed. hourly averaged so2, no2 and pm10 were observed in 26 cities, and the pollutants o3, co and pm2.5 were measured in 15 of the 26 cities. the concentrations of so2 and co were much higher in the cities in north china than those in the south. as for o3 and no2, however, there was no significant difference between northern and southern cities. fine particles were found to account for a large proportion of airborne particles, with the ratio of pm2.5 to pm10 ranging from 55% to 77%. the concentrations of pm2.5 (57.5 microg/m3) and pm10 (91.2 microg/m3) were much higher than the values (pm2.5: 11.2 microg/m3; pm10: 35.6 microg/m3) recommended by the world health organization. the attainment of the new urban air quality standard in the investigated cities is decreased by 20% in comparison with the older standard without considering o3, co and pm2.5, suggesting a great challenge in urban air quality improvement, and more efforts will to be taken to control air pollution in china.
new construction of deterministic compressed sensing matrices via singular linear spaces over finite fields we give a new explicit construction ofn×n matrices satisfying the restricted isometry property (rip). namely, for some e > 0, largen , and anyn satisfyingn1−e ≤ n ≤ n , we construct rip matrices of order k ≥ n1/2+e and constant δ = n−e. this overcomes the natural barrier k = o(n1/2) for proofs based on small coherence, which are used in all previous explicit constructions of rip matrices. key ingredients in our proof are new estimates for sumsets in product sets and for exponential sums with the products of sets possessing special additive structure. we also give a construction of sets of n complex numbers whose kth moments are uniformly small for 1 ≤ k ≤ n (turan’s power sum problem), which improves upon known explicit constructions when (logn)1+o(1) ≤ n ≤ (logn)4+o(1). this latter construction produces elementary explicit examples of n×n matrices that satisfy the rip and whose columns constitute a new spherical code; for those problems the parameters closely match those of existing constructions in the range (logn )1+o(1) ≤ n ≤ (logn)5/2+o(1).
prevalence and causes of low vision and blindness in an elderly population in nepal: the bhaktapur retina study background a national eye care programme was launched in nepal in the early 1980s. the impact of this programme on blindness and cataract surgery prevalence was evaluated in two geographic zones. methods people aged 45 years and older were sampled using a stratified cluster design. within randomly selected clusters, door to door enumeration was followed by visual acuity measurement and eye examinations at conveniently located sites. the full survey was preceded by a pilot study where operational methods were refined and quality assurance measures carried out. results of the 5112 enumerated individuals 90% were examined. blindness, defined as presenting visual acuity less than 6/60 in both eyes, was found in 5.3% (95% ci 3.6, 6.8) of individuals examined, with cataract being the principal cause in at least one eye in 78% of cases. considering both cataract operated and unoperated cataract blind cases, surgical coverage was approximately 42%. conclusion the findings suggest that blindness prevalence may have decreased slightly from that estimated in a 1981 national survey, both overall and cataract related. similarly, cataract surgical coverage may have increased somewhat. none of these changes, however, are at statistically significant levels. accordingly, the blindness problem remains challengingly high.
a critical evaluation of the down syndrome diagnosis for lb1, type specimen of homo floresiensis introduction the purpose of this study was to assess the growth of the cranial base in a sample of patients diagnosed with down syndrome (ds).   methods the sample comprised 47 subjects (25 boys, 22 girls) with ds. all patients had at least 2 x-rays that showed the cranial base. to make comparisons among age groups, the sample was divided into 3 groups: prepubescent (8-11 years), pubescent (12-14 years), and postpubescent (15-18 years). a control group included 38 normal subjects (22 boys, 16 girls, without ds) who were part of a longitudinal growth sample. computerized cephalometric analysis was performed on all subjects, and cephalometric superimpositions were made. two-way anova was used to study the overall changes between groups. in addition, 1-way anova and the duncan multiple range test were used to analyze possible differences in the age groups.   results cranial base growth in patients with ds from age 8 to 18 was similar to that of the control group. structural differences in the cranial base are established before 8 years of age and consist of shorter, flatter anterior and posterior bases.
predictors of postprandial hypotension in elderly patients with de novo parkinson’s disease postprandial hypotension was first recognized as a clinical problem in 1977 in a patient with parkinson disease [1]. however, the hypotensive effect of meal ingestion has been appreciated for a longer time. in 1935, gladstone [2] described a hypertensive patient who had had a postprandial decrease in blood pressure from 185/120 mm hg to 145/80 mm hg. in 1953, smirk [3] observed a decrease in blood pressure after patients with autonomic failure ingested food. robertson and colleagues [4] confirmed these results in patients with chronic autonomic failure and found an average decrease in systolic blood pressure of 49 6 mm hg after a meal [4]. since lipsitz and colleagues [5] first described it in nursing home residents a decade ago, postprandial hypotension has become recognized as a common disorder of blood pressure regulation in the elderly [5]. our current understanding of postprandial hypotension is limited by the lack of a standardized, clinically meaningful definition. analogous to orthostatic hypotension, postprandial hypotension is commonly defined in the literature as a decrease in systolic blood pressure of 20 mm hg or more within 2 hours of the start of a meal. postprandial hypotension also develops when the absolute level of systolic blood pressure after a meal decreases to less than 90 mm hg and when the systolic blood pressure before a meal is greater than 100 mm hg. in addition, if a meal-related decrease in systolic blood pressure exceeds the threshold for cerebral autoregulation, patients may become symptomatic when the absolute systolic blood pressure level exceeds 90 mm hg or when the postprandial systolic blood pressure decreases to less than 20 mm hg. the frequent absence of symptoms associated with this decrease in blood pressure after meal ingestion makes the value of this definition uncertain. in addition, the morbidity and mortality related to postprandial hypotension are unknown. a potential cumulative effect of multiple hypotensive stresses, such as posture change or administration of medication at the time of meal ingestion, makes assessment of the clinical relevance of individual blood pressure responses to a meal even more difficult. although it can be exacerbated by posture change, postprandial hypotension is a distinct entity that differs from orthostatic hypotension. we have reviewed the current knowledge of the epidemiology, clinical symptoms and significance, pathophysiology, and management of postprandial hypotension. we hope to make the practicing physician more aware of this common abnormality in blood pressure regulation and to stimulate new research of its mechanisms and management. methods through a medline search, we identified all articles on postprandial hypertension published between 1966 and 1994. we also used the bibliographies of relevant articles. all articles and case reports describing meal-related hypotension in the elderly and in patients with autonomic failure were included for analysis. epidemiology and associated conditions during the past decade, hypotension in response to ingestion of a mixed meal or oral glucose has been shown in healthy elderly persons [6-14]; young and elderly persons with hypertension [10, 15-21]; elderly patients in nursing homes [5, 22-25]; and patients with postprandial syncope [26, 27], autonomic insufficiency [4, 28-36], parkinson disease [1, 37-39], paraplegia [40], diabetes mellitus [28, 38, 41], cardiovascular disease [42, 43], and renal failure treated with hemodialysis [44, 45]. however, the epidemiology of postprandial hypotension has not been thoroughly studied. mild, meal-induced decreases in blood pressure are common in healthy older persons [6-11], but the prevalence of these decreases is unknown. the presence of multiple illnesses in elderly persons may further impair cardiovascular adaptation to meal ingestion and result in marked postprandial decreases in blood pressure. investigations of elderly persons living in nursing homes have shown that nearly all persons experience some decrease in blood pressure [24, 25]. in 24% to 36% of these patients, systolic blood pressure decreases more than 20 mm hg within 75 minutes of eating a meal [24, 25]. it has been difficult to dissociate the effects of physiologic aging on postprandial blood pressure regulation from those of age-associated illnesses. the elevation in blood pressure associated with aging can profoundly influence postprandial blood pressure. in a study of 82 healthy persons aged 19 to 79 years, meal-related reductions in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly correlated. however, when the data were corrected for baseline blood pressure, this correlation was no longer seen [46]. older hypertensive persons have greater reductions in blood pressure after ingesting food or oral glucose than do age-matched normotensive persons [7, 9, 10, 17-20]. postprandial decreases in systolic blood pressure ranging from 17 to 25 mm hg have been found in hypertensive elderly patients older than age 65 years who did not have other overt cardiovascular diseases [9, 10, 17, 18]. in these patients, diastolic blood pressure may decrease as much as 15 mm hg. however, because hypertensive middle-aged and young persons also have postprandial decreases in blood pressure [10, 16], this phenomenon may be primarily caused by blood pressure elevation rather than by aging itself. profound postprandial hypotension has been observed in patients with autonomic failure [1, 4, 28-36, 47, 48]. the first case report described a 65-year-old man who had dizziness and visual disturbance associated with large decreases in blood pressure after almost every meal [1]. robertson and colleagues [4] found a marked postprandial decrease in sitting systolic blood pressure (range, 22 to 98 mm hg) in 10 patients with autonomic failure. hoeldtke and associates [28, 47] studied patients with multiple-system atrophy (the shy-drager syndrome) and pure autonomic failure and found that the decrease in the mean sitting postprandial arterial blood pressure ranged from 62 to 83 mm hg [28, 47]. all of these patients had blurred vision and dizziness after the meal [47]. postprandial hypotension is also commonly found in patients with peripheral neuropathy caused by diabetes mellitus or other disorders [28, 33, 38, 41] as well as by parkinson disease [1, 37-39]. hypotension is a common side effect of antiparkinsonian drugs such as levodopa. in patients with renal failure, symptomatic postprandial hypotension has been seen during hemodialysis [44, 45]. this appears to be relevant primarily in uremic patients who have autonomic dysfunction. determining the prevalence and clinical implications of postprandial hypotension is complicated not only by different diseases and drugs in the populations studied but also by methodologic inconsistencies among studies. first, the body's position while the meal is being consumed probably affects food-induced changes in blood pressure. postprandial hypotension occurs both in the sitting and supine positions. although the sitting position is more physiologic, orthostatic changes in blood pressure during prolonged sitting might contribute to the postprandial decrease in blood pressure. second, no studies have addressed the variability of postprandial blood pressure. previous studies have shown that orthostatic blood pressure measurements in the elderly vary considerably from day to day [49]. this could also be true for postprandial hypotension. third, the nutrient composition of meals affects the magnitude of the decrease in postprandial blood pressure [12, 13, 15, 50]. carbohydrates and, more specifically, glucose have been found to play a significant role [10, 29]. however, conflicting data have been reported about the influence of fat or protein on postprandial blood pressure [12, 13, 15, 51, 52]. fourth, postprandial hypotension depends on the temperature of the meal [53]. after cold glucose solutions are ingested, blood pressure remains unchanged, whereas glucose solutions served warm or at room temperature cause a decrease in blood pressure. finally, the time at which blood pressure is measured after a meal may influence the detection of this phenomenon. postprandial hypotension can be found at all meal times [14] and is almost immediately apparent after a meal. blood pressure usually reaches a nadir within 30 to 60 minutes. in nursing home residents, the systolic blood pressure nadir occurred as early as 15 minutes after the meal in 13% to 17% of the patients and as late as 75 minutes after the meal in 11% to 13% of the patients [24, 25]. clinical symptoms and significance in elderly persons or patients with autonomic failure, postprandial reductions in blood pressure may result in syncope, falls, angina pectoris, weakness, dizziness, nausea, lightheadedness, or black spots in the visual field [1, 5, 22, 24-26, 29, 39, 46] (table 1). in addition, case reports have described elderly patients with large postprandial reductions in blood pressure who developed angina pectoris or transient ischemic attacks that resolved as blood pressure returned to normal [24, 54]. however, data on the frequency of postprandial hypotension and its potential symptoms are scarce. in one recent study, half of a group of patients with unexplained syncope had postprandial hypotension [27]. table 1. clinical symptoms associated with postprandial hypotension the cerebral symptoms probably depend on the extent to which cerebral perfusion is compromised. accumulation of age- and disease-related conditions that threaten cerebral blood flow or reduce oxygen content in the blood may bring cerebral oxygen delivery near the threshold needed to maintain consciousness [55]. therefore, even small changes in blood pressure may reduce cerebral oxygen delivery to below the critical threshold and thus result in ischemic symptoms. the potential for postprandial cerebral ischemia may be greater in elderly p
shared filtering processes link attentional and visual short-term memory capacity limits. the capacity of visual short-term memory is highly limited, maintaining only three to four objects simultaneously. this extreme limitation necessitates efficient mechanisms to select only the most relevant objects from the immediate environment to be represented in memory and to restrict irrelevant items from consuming capacity. here we report a neurophysiological measure of this memory selection mechanism in humans that gauges an individual's efficiency at excluding irrelevant items from being stored in memory. by examining the moment-by-moment contents of visual memory, we observe that selection efficiency varies substantially across individuals and is strongly predicted by the particular memory capacity of each person. specifically, high capacity individuals are much more efficient at representing only the relevant items than are low capacity individuals, who inefficiently encode and maintain information about the irrelevant items present in the display. these results provide evidence that under many circumstances low capacity individuals may actually store more information in memory than high capacity individuals. indeed, this ancillary allocation of memory capacity to irrelevant objects may be a primary source of putative differences in overall storage capacity.
a prospective randomized trial using blood volume analysis in addition to pulmonary artery catheter, compared with pulmonary artery catheter alone, to guide shock resuscitation in critically ill surgical patients background recent studies have suggested that early goal-directed resuscitation of patients with septic shock and conservative fluid management of patients with acute lung injury (ali) can improve outcomes. because these may be seen as potentially conflicting practices, we set out to determine the influence of fluid management on the outcomes of patients with septic shock complicated by ali.   methods a retrospective analysis was performed at barnes-jewish hospital (st. louis, mo) and in the medical icu of mayo medical center (rochester, mn). patients hospitalized with septic shock were enrolled into the study if they met the american-european consensus definition of ali within 72 h of septic shock onset. adequate initial fluid resuscitation (aifr) was defined as the administration of an initial fluid bolus of >or= 20 ml/kg prior to and achievement of a central venous pressure of >or= 8 mm hg within 6 h after the onset of therapy with vasopressors. conservative late fluid management (clfm) was defined as even-to-negative fluid balance measured on at least 2 consecutive days during the first 7 days after septic shock onset.   results the study cohort was made up of 212 patients with ali complicating septic shock. hospital mortality was statistically lowest for those achieving both aifr and clfm and higher for those achieving only clfm, those achieving only aifr, and those achieving neither (17 of 93 patients [18.3%] vs 13 of 31 patients [41.9%] vs 30 of 53 patients [56.6%] vs 27 of 35 [77.1%], respectively; p < 0.001).   conclusions both early and late fluid management of septic shock complicated by ali can influence patient outcomes.
nanocarbons in electrospun polymeric nanomats for tissue engineering: a review polypropylene (pp)/carbon nanotubes (cnts) nanocomposites were prepared by coating cnts on the surface of gelated/swollen soft pp pellets. the electrical conductivity (σ) studies revealed a percolation threshold of only 0.3 wt %, and the electrical conductivity mechanism followed a 3-d variable range hopping (vrh) behavior. at lower processing temperature, the cnts formed the network structure more easily, resulting in a higher σ. the fraction of γ-phase pp increased with increasing the pressing temperature. the cnts at lower loading (0.1 wt %) served as nucleating sites and promoted the crystallization of pp. the cnts favored the disentanglement of polymer chains and thus caused an even lower melt viscosity of nanocomposites than that of pure pp. the calculated optical band gap of cnts was observed to increase with increasing the processing temperature, i.e., 1.55 ev for nanocomposites prepared at 120 °c and 1.70 ev prepared at 160 and 180 °c. both the drude model and interband transition phenomenon have been used for theoretical analysis of the real permittivity of the nanocomposites.
the bacterial meta-cleavage hydrolase ligy belongs to the amidohydrolase superfamily, not to the α/β-hydrolase superfamily for murine adenosine deaminase, we have determined that a single zinc or cobalt cofactor bound in a high affinity site is required for catalytic function while metal ions bound at an additional site(s) inhibit the enzyme. a catalytically inactive apoenzyme of murine adenosine deaminase was produced by dialysis in the presence of specific zinc chelators in an acidic buffer. this represents the first production of the apoenzyme and demonstrates a rigorous method for removing the occult cofactor. restoration to the holoenzyme is achieved with stoichiometric amounts of either zn2+ or co2+ yielding at least 95% of initial activity. far uv cd and fluorescence spectra are the same for both the apo‐ and holoenzyme, providing evidence that removal of the cofactor does not alter secondary or tertiary structure. the substrate binding site remains functional as determined by similar quenching measured by tryptophan fluorescence of apo‐ or holoenzyme upon mixing with the transition state analog, deoxycoformycin. excess levels of adenosine or n6‐methyladenosine incubated with the apoenzyme prior to the addition of metal prevent restoration, suggesting that the cofactor adds through the substrate binding cleft. the cations ca2+, cd2+ cr2+, cu+, cu2+, mn2+, fe2+, fe3+, pb2+, or mg2+ did not restore adenosine deaminase activity to the apoenzyme. mn2+, cu2+, and zn2+ were found to be competitive inhibitors of the holoenzyme with respect to substrate and cd2+ and co2+ were noncompetitive inhibitors. weak inhibition (ki ≥ 1000 μm) was noted for ca2+, fe2+, and fe3+.
sprouty2 regulates endochondral bone formation by modulation of rtk and bmp signaling. bone morphogenetic protein (bmp) signaling is required for endochondral bone formation. however, whether or not the effects of bmps are mediated via canonical smad pathways or through noncanonical pathways is unknown. in this study we have determined the role of receptor smads 1, 5 and 8 in chondrogenesis. deletion of individual smads results in viable and fertile mice. combined loss of smads 1, 5 and 8, however, results in severe chondrodysplasia. smad1/5cko (cartilage-specific knockout) mutant mice are nearly identical to smad1/5cko;smad8-/- mutants, indicating that smads 1 and 5 have overlapping functions and are more important than smad8 in cartilage. the smad1/5cko phenotype is more severe than that of smad4cko mice, challenging the dogma, at least in chondrocytes, that smad4 is required to mediate smad signaling through bmp pathways. the chondrodysplasia in smad1/5cko mice is accompanied by imbalances in cross-talk between the bmp, fgf and ihh/pthrp pathways. we show that ihh is a direct target of bmp pathways in chondrocytes, and that fgf exerts antagonistic effects on ihh expression. finally, we tested whether fgf exerts its antagonistic effects directly through smad linker phosphorylation. the results support the alternative conclusion that the effects of fgfs on bmp signaling are indirect in vivo.
genome-wide association with c-reactive protein levels in clhns: evidence for the crp and hnf1a loci and their interaction with exposure to a pathogenic environment obesity and infectious agents are both sources of inflammatory stimuli that result in increased production of c-reactive protein (crp). rates of overweight and obesity are increasing globally, but for many populations, gains in body fat are set against a backdrop of high levels of pathogen exposure. our primary objective was to evaluate the extent to which adiposity and pathogenicity contribute to a double burden of inflammation in a population currently undergoing the nutrition transition. measures of adiposity, pathogen exposure, and infectious disease symptoms were evaluated as predictors of high-sensitivity crp concentration in plasma samples from 1875 women participating in the cebu longitudinal health and nutrition survey in the philippines. proxy measures of pathogen exposure included household crowding and cleanliness, quality of water source, mode of waste disposal, and fecal exposure. a series of maximum likelihood logistic regression models were used to predict a plasma crp concentration > 3 mg/l. waist circumference was the strongest anthropometric predictor of elevated crp [odds ratio (or) = 2.29; 95% ci = 2.00, 2.62; p < 0.001]. presence of infectious disease symptoms (or = 2.51; 95% ci = 1.84, 3.44; p < 0.001) and level of pathogen exposure (or = 1.56; 95% ci = 1.15, 2.12; p < 0.01) were also associated with elevated crp. these associations were independent of socioeconomic status and other health behaviors. overweight/obesity and infectious exposures are associated with elevated crp in the philippines; it is likely that other populations undergoing the nutrition transition are experiencing comparable double burdens of inflammatory stimuli. these results underscore the need for additional research on the contributions of pathogenicity, adiposity, and inflammation to global epidemics of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.
direct peptide profiling of lateral cell groups of the antennal lobes of manduca sexta reveals specific composition and changes in neuropeptide expression during development studies of release under physiological conditions provide more direct data about the identity of neuromodulatory signaling molecules than studies of tissue localization that cannot distinguish between processing precursors and biologically active neuropeptides. we have identified neuropeptides released by electrical stimulation of nerves that contain the axons of the modulatory projection neurons to the stomatogastric ganglion of the crab, cancer borealis. preparations were bathed in saline containing a cocktail of peptidase inhibitors to minimize peptide degradation. both electrical stimulation of projection nerves and depolarization with high k+ saline were used to evoke release. releasates were desalted and then identified by mass using maldi–tof (matrix‐assisted laser desorption/ionization–time‐of‐flight) mass spectrometry. both previously known and novel peptides were detected. subsequent to electrical stimulation proctolin, cancer borealis tachykinin‐related peptide (cabtrp), fvnsrya, carcinustatin‐8, allatostatin‐3 (ast‐3), red pigment concentrating hormone, nrnflrfa, ast‐5, sgfyanrya, tnrnflrfa, ast‐9, orcomyotropin‐related peptide, corazonin, ala13‐orcokinin, and ser9‐val13‐orcokinin were detected. some of these were also detected after high k+ depolarization. release was calcium dependent. in summary, we have shown release of the neuropeptides thought to play an important neuromodulatory role in the stomatogastric ganglion, as well as numerous other candidate neuromodulators that remain to be identified.
granule cell dispersion in temporal lobe epilepsy is associated with changes in dendritic orientation and spine distribution the distribution of granule cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation was studied in control autopsy and temporal lobe epilepsy (tle) specimens. in control tissue, the granule cell somata were closely approximated and formed a narrow lamina with a distinct, regular border with the molecular layer. in 11 of 15 tle specimens, the granule cell somata were dispersed and formed a wider than normal granule cell layer. the granule cell somata extended into the molecular layer to varying extents, creating an irregular boundary between the lamina. the dispersed granule cells were frequently aligned in columns, and many of these neurons displayed elongated bipolar forms. the extent of granule cell dispersion appeared to be related to the amount of cell loss in the polymorph layer of the dentate gyrus. granule cell dispersion was not consistently associated with granule cell loss although 5 of the 11 specimens with granule cell dispersion also showed moderate to marked granule cell loss. the most common features in the histories of the tle cases with granule cell dispersion were severe febrile seizures or seizures associated with meningitis or encephalitis during the first 4 years of life. the dispersion of the granule cells suggests that there has been some alteration in the patterns of cell migration in a subpopulation of cases with severe tle. the resultant ectopic positions of the granule cells could lead to changes in both the afferent and efferent connections of these neurons and, thus, contribute to the altered circuitry of the hippocampal formation in tle.
annual and diurnal variations of gaseous and particulate pollutants in 31 provincial capital cities based on in situ air quality monitoring data from china national environmental monitoring center. o3 and pm2.5 were introduced into the newly revised air quality standard system in february 2012, representing a milestone in the history of air pollution control, and china's urban air quality will be evaluated using six factors (so2, no2, o3, co, pm2.5 and pm10) from the beginning of 2013. to achieve the new air quality standard, it is extremely important to have a primary understanding of the current pollution status in various cities. the spatial and temporal variations of the air pollutants were investigated in 26 pilot cities in china from august 2011 to february 2012, just before the new standard was executed. hourly averaged so2, no2 and pm10 were observed in 26 cities, and the pollutants o3, co and pm2.5 were measured in 15 of the 26 cities. the concentrations of so2 and co were much higher in the cities in north china than those in the south. as for o3 and no2, however, there was no significant difference between northern and southern cities. fine particles were found to account for a large proportion of airborne particles, with the ratio of pm2.5 to pm10 ranging from 55% to 77%. the concentrations of pm2.5 (57.5 microg/m3) and pm10 (91.2 microg/m3) were much higher than the values (pm2.5: 11.2 microg/m3; pm10: 35.6 microg/m3) recommended by the world health organization. the attainment of the new urban air quality standard in the investigated cities is decreased by 20% in comparison with the older standard without considering o3, co and pm2.5, suggesting a great challenge in urban air quality improvement, and more efforts will to be taken to control air pollution in china.
nicotine increases anterior insula activation to expected and unexpected outcomes among nonsmokers while dopamine systems have been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and psychosis for many years, how dopamine dysfunction generates psychotic symptoms remains unknown. recent theoretical interest has been directed at relating the known role of midbrain dopamine neurons in reinforcement learning, motivational salience and prediction error to explain the abnormal mental experience of psychosis. however, this theoretical model has yet to be explored empirically. to examine a link between psychotic experience, reward learning and dysfunction of the dopaminergic midbrain and associated target regions, we asked a group of first episode psychosis patients suffering from active positive symptoms and a group of healthy control participants to perform an instrumental reward conditioning experiment. we characterized neural responses using functional magnetic resonance imaging. we observed that patients with psychosis exhibit abnormal physiological responses associated with reward prediction error in the dopaminergic midbrain, striatum and limbic system, and we demonstrated subtle abnormalities in the ability of psychosis patients to discriminate between motivationally salient and neutral stimuli. this study provides the first evidence linking abnormal mesolimbic activity, reward learning and psychosis.
inter‐ and intramuscular differences in training‐induced hypertrophy of the quadriceps femoris: association with muscle activation during the first training session summaryfour male subjects aged 23–34 years were studied during 60 days of unilateral strength training and 40 days of detraining. training was carried out four times a week and consisted of six series of ten maximal isokinetic knee extensions at an angular velocity of 2.09 rad·s−1. at the start and at every 20th day of training and detraining, isometric maximal voluntary contraction (mvc), integrated electromyographic activity (iemg) and quadriceps muscle cross-sectional area (csa) assessed at seven fractions of femur length (lf), by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, were measured on both trained (t) and untrained (ut) legs. isokinetic torques at 30° before full knee extension were measured before and at the end of training at: 0, 1.05, 2.09, 3.14, 4.19, 5.24 rad·s−1. after 60 days t leg csa had increased by 8.5%±1.4% (mean±sem,n=4,p<0.001), iemg by 42.4%±16.5% (p<0.01) and mvc by 20.8%±5.4% (p<0.01). changes during detraining had a similar time course to those of training. no changes in ut leg csa were observed while iemg and mvc increased by 24.8%±10% (n.s.) and 8.7%±4.3% (n.s.), respectively. the increase in quadriceps muscle csa was maximal at 2/10 lf (12.0%±1.5%,p<0.01) and minimal, proximally to the knee, at 8/10 lf (3.5%±1.2%, n.s.). preferential hypertrophy of the vastus medialis and intermedius muscles compared to those of the rectus femoris and lateralis muscles was observed. isoangular torque of t leg increased by 20.9%±5.4% (p<0.05), 23.8%±7.8% (p<0.05) and 22.5%±6.7% (p<0.05) at 0, 1.05 and 2.09 rad·s−1 respectively; no significant change was observed at higher velocities and in the ut leg. hypertrophy produced by strength training accounts for 40% of the increase in force while the remaining 60% seems to be attributable to an increased neural drive and possibly to changes in muscle architecture.
clinical significance of serum hyaluronic acid level alteration in patient with nasopharyngeal carcinoma in this study, a hyaluronan-binding complex, which we termed metastatin, was isolated from bovine cartilage by affinity chromatography and found to have both antitumorigenic and antiangiogenic properties. metastatin was able to block the formation of tumor nodules in the lungs of mice inoculated with b16bl6 melanoma or lewis lung carcinoma cells. single i.v. administration of metastatin into chicken embryos inhibited the growth of both b16bl6 mouse melanoma and tsu human prostate cancer cells growing on the chorioallantoic membrane. the in vivo biological effect may be attributed to the antiangiogenic activity because metastatin is able to inhibit the migration and proliferation of cultured endothelial cells as well as vascular endothelial growth factor-induced angiogenesis on the chorioallantoic membrane. in each case, the effect could be blocked by either heat denaturing the metastatin or premixing it with hyaluronan, suggesting that its activity critically depends on its ability to bind hyaluronan on the target cells. collectively, these results suggest that metastatin is an effective antitumor agent that exhibits antiangiogenic activity.
genetic conflict between sexual signalling and juvenile survival in the three-spined stickleback ‘good-genes’ models of sexual selection predict significant additive genetic variation for fitness-correlated traits within populations to be revealed by phenotypic traits. to test this prediction, we sampled brown trout (salmo trutta) from their natural spawning place, analysed their carotenoid-based red and melanin-based dark skin colours and tested whether these colours can be used to predict offspring viability. we produced half-sib families by in vitro fertilization, reared the resulting embryos under standardized conditions, released the hatchlings into a streamlet and identified the surviving juveniles 20 months later with microsatellite markers. embryo viability was revealed by the sires' dark pigmentation: darker males sired more viable offspring. however, the sires' red coloration correlated negatively with embryo survival. our study demonstrates that genetic variation for fitness-correlated traits is revealed by male colour traits in our study population, but contrary to predictions from other studies, intense red colours do not signal good genes.
what we learned from the dust bowl: lessons in science, policy, and adaptation abstract coupled global circulation models (cgcms) have been widely used to explore potential future climate change. before these climate projections can be trusted, the ability of the models to simulate present-day climate must be assessed. this study evaluates the ability of three cgcms that participated in the fourth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change to simulate long-term drought over the great plains region with the same frequency and intensity as was observed during the twentieth century. the three models evaluated in this study are the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory coupled model, version 2.0 (cm2.0); the national centers for atmospheric research community climate system model, version 3 (ccsm3); and third climate configuration of the met office unified model (hadcm3). the models are shown to capture the broad features of the climatology of the great plains, with maximum precipitation occurring in early summer, as observed. however, all of the models overestim...
clinical and institutional interventions and children’s resilience and recovery from sexual abuse a recent surgeon general's report and various studies document racial and ethnic disparities in mental health care, including gaps in access, questionable diagnostic practices, and limited provision of optimum treatments. bias is a little studied but viable explanation for these disparities. it is important to isolate bias from other barriers to high-quality mental health care and to understand bias at several levels (practitioner, practice network or program, and community). more research is needed that directly evaluates the contribution of particular forms of bias to disparities in the area of mental health care.
measuring multiple parameters of cd8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in human cancers by image analysis immune cell infiltration is common to many tumors and has been recognized by pathologists for more than 100 years. the application of digital imaging and objective assessment software allowed a concise determination of the type and quantity of immune cells and their location relative to the tumor and, in the case of colon cancer, characterized overall survival better than ajcc tnm staging. subsequently, expression of pd-l1, by 50% or more tumor cells, identified nsclc patients with double the response rate to anti-pd-1. soon, automated staining methods will improve reproducibility of multiplex staining and allow for clia standards so that multiplex staining can be used to make clinical decisions. ultimately, machine-learning algorithms will help interpret data from tissue images and lead to improved delivery of precision medicine.

a huge review and meta-analyses of genetic associations in new onset diabetes after kidney transplantation transcription factor-7-like 2 (tcf7l2) is the most important type 2 diabetes susceptibility gene identified to date, with common intronic variants strongly associated with diabetes in all major racial groups. this ubiquitous transcription factor in the wnt signaling pathway was not previously known to be involved in glucose homeostasis, so defining the underlying mechanism(s) will provide new insights into diabetes. in this issue of the jci, lyssenko and colleagues report on their human and isolated islet studies and suggest that the risk allele increases tcf7l2 expression in the pancreatic beta cell, reducing insulin secretion and hence predisposing the individual to diabetes (see the related article beginning on page 2155).
new approach for selectively convertible undeniable signature schemes we introduce a new computational problem related to the interpolation of group homomorphisms which generalizes many famous cryptographic problems including discrete logarithm, diffie-hellman, and rsa. as an application, we propose a generic undeniable signaturescheme which generalizes the mova schemes. our scheme is generic in the sense that we transform a private group homomorphism from public groups g to h (the order of h being public) into an undeniable signature scheme. it is provably secure in the random oracle model provided that the interpolation problem is hard and it offers the advantage of making the signature size arbitrarily short (depending on a security level). we (im)prove some security results from mova. we also propose a new example with complexity similar to rsa and with 3-byte signatures.
neuropsychological and neuroimaging underpinnings of schizoaffective disorder: a systematic review background schizophrenia (sz) is characterized by a broad global cognitive impairment that precedes the onset of the disease. by contrast, some studies suggest that premorbid deficits are absent, or even reversed, in bipolar disorder (bd). however, studies have shown impairments in cognitive functioning after the illness onset in both disorders. the aim of this study was to systematically review and meta-analyze those studies that compared premorbid and/or post-onset global cognitive function between sz and bd.   method we searched medline (pubmed), embase and psycinfo for studies where information on cognitive functioning was collected in both sz and bd within the same study or using the same methods.   results compared to healthy comparison groups, sz patients showed a significant premorbid cognitive impairment [standardized mean difference (smd) -0.597, 95% confidence interval (ci) -0.707 to -0.487, p < 0.0001] and a large post-onset impairment (smd -1.369, 95% ci -1.578 to -1.160, p < 0.0001). we found small significant deficits in premorbid intellectual function in the bd group when this was assessed retrospectively (-0.147, 95% ci -0.238 to -0.056, p = 0.001) but not prospectively (-0.029, 95% ci -0.199 to + 0.142, p = 0.744), and moderate cognitive impairment after onset (smd -0.623, 95% ci -0.717 to -0.529, p < 0.0001).   conclusions sz is characterized by significant deficits in premorbid intellectual function but the evidence regarding premorbid function in bd is equivocal. after illness onset, patients with both disorders seem to suffer a further decline in cognitive function but the magnitude of the impairment remains greater in sz than in bd.
data management challenges in paediatric information systems there is a compelling demand for the integration and exploitation of heterogeneous biomedical information for improved clinical practice, medical research, and personalised healthcare across the eu. the health-e-child project aims at developing an integrated healthcare platform for european paediatrics, providing seamless integration of traditional and emerging sources of biomedical information. the long-term goal of the project is to provide uninhibited access to universal biomedical knowledge repositories for personalised and preventive healthcare, large-scale information-based biomedical research and training, and informed policy making. the project focus will be on individualised disease prevention, screening, early diagnosis, therapy and follow-up of paediatric heart diseases, inflammatory diseases, and brain tumours. the project will build a gridenabled european network of leading clinical centres that will share and annotate biomedical data, validate systems clinically, and diffuse clinical excellence across europe by setting up new technologies, clinical workflows, and standards. this paper outlines the design approach being adopted in health-e-child to enable the delivery of an integrated biomedical information platform.
face recognition using 2.5d shape information previous work has demonstrated that the image variation of many objects (human faces in particular) under variable lighting can be effectively modeled by low-dimensional linear spaces, even when there are multiple light sources and shadowing. basis images spanning this space are usually obtained in one of three ways: a large set of images of the object under different lighting conditions is acquired, and principal component analysis (pca) is used to estimate a subspace. alternatively, synthetic images are rendered from a 3d model (perhaps reconstructed from images) under point sources and, again, pca is used to estimate a subspace. finally, images rendered from a 3d model under diffuse lighting based on spherical harmonics are directly used as basis images. in this paper, we show how to arrange physical lighting so that the acquired images of each object can be directly used as the basis vectors of a low-dimensional linear space and that this subspace is close to those acquired by the other methods. more specifically, there exist configurations of k point light source directions, with k typically ranging from 5 to 9, such that, by taking k images of an object under these single sources, the resulting subspace is an effective representation for recognition under a wide range of lighting conditions. since the subspace is generated directly from real images, potentially complex and/or brittle intermediate steps such as 3d reconstruction can be completely avoided; nor is it necessary to acquire large numbers of training images or to physically construct complex diffuse (harmonic) light fields. we validate the use of subspaces constructed in this fashion within the context of face recognition.
cigarette smoke induction of interleukin-27/wsx-1 regulates the differentiation of th1 and th17 cells in a smoking mouse model of emphysema studies have focused on the events that influence the development of interleukin 17 (il-17)–producing t helper cells (th-17 cells) associated with autoimmunity, such as experimental autoimmune encephalitis, but relatively little is known about the cytokines that antagonize th-17 cell effector responses. here we show that il-27 receptor–deficient mice chronically infected with toxoplasma gondii developed severe neuroinflammation that was cd4+ t cell dependent and was associated with a prominent il-17 response. in vitro, treatment of naive primary t cells with il-27 suppressed the development th-17 cells induced by il-6 and transforming growth factor-β, which was dependent on the intracellular signaling molecule stat1 but was independent of inhibition of il-6 signaling mediated by the suppressor protein socs3. thus il-27, a potent inhibitor of th-17 cell development, may be a useful target for treating inflammatory diseases mediated by these cells.
endoscopic management of antrochoanal polyps: a single uk centre’s experience antrochoanal polyps (acp) are benign lesions that arise from the mucosa of the maxillary sinus, grow into the maxillary sinus and reach the choana, and nasal obstruction being their main symptom. it is an interesting model to compare the pathophysiological mechanisms with those of bilateral nasal polyposis (np). there is a lack of research in some areas of acp, which have to become the main aims for future investigations of this disease. in comparison to np, acps are usually unilateral and appear in younger patients. macroscopically, they have a cystic intramaxillary portion and a solid intranasal portion. microscopically, they are similar to a maxillary cyst of the mucosa. nasal endoscopy, computed tomography and magnetic resonance are the main diagnostic techniques. surgery is the indicated treatment for acp, with endoscopic resection the most recommended. simple avulsion of the polyp has a high rate of recurrence, whereas the caldwell-luc procedure is associated with damage of the maxillary and dental growth centres. more research is needed to establish the relationship between chronic sinusitis and acp. further work is also needed to investigate the role of inflammatory mediators (histamine, ige, adhesion molecules, paf), as well as metalloproteases and nasal remodelling, and tumour marker expression in a cp.
the anti-ovarian cancer activity by wye-132, a mtorc1/2 dual inhibitor sphingolipid metabolites have emerged as critical players in a number of fundamental biological processes. among them, sphingosine-1-phosphate (s1p) promotes cell survival and proliferation, in contrast to ceramide and sphingosine, which induce cell growth arrest and apoptosis. these sphingolipids with opposing functions are interconvertible inside cells, suggesting that a finely tuned balance between them can determine cell fate. sphingosine kinases (sphks), which catalyze the phosphorylation of sphingosine to s1p, are critical regulators of this balance. of the two identified sphks, sphingosine kinase type 1 (sphk1) has been shown to regulate various processes important for cancer progression and will be the focus of this review, since much less is known of biological functions of sphk2, especially in cancer. sphk1 is overexpressed in various types of cancers and upregulation of sphk1 has been associated with tumor angiogenesis and resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. many growth factors, through their tyrosine kinase receptors (rtks), stimulate sphk1 leading to a rapid increase in s1p. this s1p in turn can activate s1p receptors and their downstream signaling. conversely, activation of s1p receptors can induce transactivation of various rtks. thus, sphk1 may play important roles in s1p receptor rtk amplification loops. here we review the role of sphk1 in tumorigenesis, hormonal therapy, chemotherapy resistance, and as a prognostic marker. we will also review studies on the effects of sphk inhibitors in cells in vitro and in animals in vivo and in some clinical trials and highlight the potential of sphk1 as a new target for cancer therapeutics.
structure-based identification, characterization, and disruption of human securin-binding sh3 domains in lung cancer the sh3 domain is perhaps the best-characterized member of the growing family of protein-interaction modules. by binding with moderate affinity and selectivity to proline-rich ligands, these domains play critical roles in a wide variety of biological processes ranging from regulation of enzymes by intramolecular interactions, increasing the local concentration or altering the subcellular localization of components of signaling pathways, and mediating the assembly of large multiprotein complexes. sh3 domains and their binding sites have cropped up in many hundreds of proteins in species from yeast to man, which suggests that they provide the cell with an especially handy and adaptable means of bringing proteins together. the wealth of genetic, biochemical and structural information available provides an intimate and detailed portrait of the domain, serving as a framework for understanding other modular protein-interaction domains. processes regulated by sh3 domains also raise important questions about the nature of specificity and the overall logic governing networks of protein interactions.
straightforward thiol-mediated protein labelling with dtpa: synthesis of a highly active 111in-annexin a5-dtpa tracer unlabelled labeled annexin v is widely used to detect cell death in vitro and in vivo. nearly all studies have been done with annexin v derivatized via amine-directed bifunctional agents; it was thought that these molecules retained full bioactivity compared with unmodified protein. we now show that this assumption is incorrect by measuring the affinity of annexin v for cells in vitro by quantitative calcium titration under conditions of low membrane occupancy.   methods annexin v was modified with 4 different amine-directed agents: the n-hydroxysuccinimide esters of hydrazinonicotinic acid, mercaptoacetyltriglycine, and biotin; and with fluorescein isothiocyanate.   results in all cases, the membrane-binding affinity was decreased by derivatization, even at very low average stoichiometries. a statistical model based on the poisson distribution accurately predicted the observed heterogeneity of derivatization as a function of average derivatization stoichiometry. this model also showed that multiply derivatized forms, which are the ones most likely to have compromised bioactivity, contributed disproportionately to the binding and imaging signals. the in vitro binding assay correctly predicted in vivo uptake in a mouse liver model of apoptosis for all proteins tested. the annexin v-128 protein, labeled at a single specific site at the n terminus, showed twice as much apoptosis-specific liver uptake as did all forms of annexin v derivatized randomly via amino groups.   conclusion the membrane-binding activity of annexin v is much more sensitive to amine-directed chemical modification than previously realized. new annexin v molecules labeled by site-specific methods will greatly improve sensitivity for detecting cell death in vivo.
a mitochondria-anchored isoform of the actin-nucleating spire protein regulates mitochondrial division masterminding mitochondrial fission mitochondria are highly dynamic and undergo fusion and fission and they move in cells. defects in mitochondrial dynamics are implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases. recent findings have suggested that mitochondrial fission occurs preferentially at endoplasmic reticulum (er) contact sites, with er circumscribing mitochondria and possibly promoting the constriction of mitochondria during fission. korobova et al. (p. 464) now suggest that an er-localized formin, inf2, is required for mitochondrial fission and that inf2-mediated actin polymerization facilitates mitochondrial constriction. actin filaments between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria promote mitochondrial fission. mitochondrial fission is fundamentally important to cellular physiology. the dynamin-related protein drp1 mediates fission, and interaction between mitochondrion and endoplasmic reticulum (er) enhances fission. however, the mechanism for drp1 recruitment to mitochondria is unclear, although previous results implicate actin involvement. here, we found that actin polymerization through er-localized inverted formin 2 (inf2) was required for efficient mitochondrial fission in mammalian cells. inf2 functioned upstream of drp1. actin filaments appeared to accumulate between mitochondria and inf2-enriched er membranes at constriction sites. thus, inf2-induced actin filaments may drive initial mitochondrial constriction, which allows drp1-driven secondary constriction. because inf2 mutations can lead to charcot-marie-tooth disease, our results provide a potential cellular mechanism for this disease state.
indomethacin pharmacodynamics are altered by surfactant: a possible challenge to current indomethacin dosing guidelines created before surfactant availability objective we conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial to determine whether higher doses of indomethacin would improve the rate of patent ductus arteriosus (pda) closure.   study design infants (<28 weeks gestation) who received a conventional, prophylactic 3-dose course of indomethacin were eligible if they had continued evidence of persistent ductus patency on an echocardiogram obtained before the third prophylactic indomethacin dose. infants (n = 105) were randomized to receive an extended 3-day course of either low-dose (0.1 mg/kg/d) or higher-dose (0.2 or 0.5 mg/kg/d) indomethacin. an echocardiogram was obtained 24 hours after the last dose of study drug.   results despite increasing serum indomethacin concentrations by 2.9-fold in the higher-dose group, we failed to detect a significant decrease in the rate of persistent pda (low = 52%; higher = 45%, p = .50). the higher-dose group had a significantly higher occurrence of serum creatinine >2 mg/100 ml (low = 6%, higher = 19%, p < .05) and moderate/severe retinopathy of prematurity (rop) (low = 15%, higher = 36%, p < .025). the incidence of moderate/severe rop was directly related to the poststudy indomethacin concentrations (odds ratio = 1.75, confidence interval: 1.15-2.68, p < .01).   conclusion increasing indomethacin concentrations above the levels achieved with a conventional dosing regimen had little effect on the rate of pda closure but was associated with higher rates of moderate/severe rop and renal compromise.
phosphoinositide binding by the snx27 ferm domain regulates its localization at the immune synapse of activated t-cells background: sorting nexin 27 regulates intracellular trafficking of proteins through the endosomal system. results: an interaction between snx27 and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor β-pix in complex with git family proteins is identified. conclusion: cells lacking snx27 have decreased cell motility, which we propose to be due to β-pix intracellular trafficking defects. significance: the results and model proposed have implications for recruitment/activation of p21-activated kinase (pak) or rho gtpases at focal adhesions. sorting nexin 27 (snx27) is a 62-kda protein localized to early endosomes and known to regulate the intracellular trafficking of ion channels and receptors. in addition to a px domain, snx27 is the only sorting family member that contains a pdz domain. to identify novel snx27-pdz binding partners, we performed a proteomic screen in mouse principal kidney cortical collecting duct cells using a gst-snx27 fusion construct as bait. we found that β-pix (p21-activated kinase-interactive exchange factor), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the rho family of small gtpases known to regulate cell motility directly interacted with snx27. the association of β-pix and snx27 is specific for β-pix isoforms terminating in the type-1 pdz binding motif (etnl). in the same screen we also identified git1/2 as a potential snx27 interacting protein. the interaction between snx27 and git1/2 is indirect and mediated by β-pix. furthermore, we show recruitment of the β-pix·git complex to endosomal sites in a snx27-dependent manner. finally, migration assays revealed that depletion of snx27 from hela and mouse principal kidney cortical collecting duct cells significantly decreases cell motility. we propose a model by which snx27 regulates trafficking of β-pix to focal adhesions and thereby influences cell motility.
an amish founder mutation disrupts a pi(3)p-whamm-arp2/3 complex–driven autophagosomal remodeling pathway a fundamental question regarding autophagosome formation is how the shape of the double-membrane autophagosomal vesicle is generated. here we show that in mammalian cells assembly of an actin scaffold inside the isolation membrane (the autophagosomal precursor) is essential for autophagosomal membrane shaping. actin filaments are depolymerized shortly after starvation and actin is assembled into a network within the isolation membrane. when formation of actin puncta is disrupted by an actin polymerization inhibitor or by knocking down the actin-capping protein capzβ, isolation membranes and omegasomes collapse into mixed-membrane bundles. formation of actin puncta is ptdins(3)p dependent, and inhibition of ptdins(3)p formation by treating cells with the pi(3)k inhibitor 3-ma, or by knocking down beclin-1, abolishes the formation of actin puncta. binding of capz to ptdins(3)p, which is enriched in omegasomes, stimulates actin polymerization. our findings illuminate the mechanism underlying autophagosomal membrane shaping and provide key insights into how autophagosomes are formed.
distinct muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes contribute to stability and growth, but not compensatory plasticity, of neuromuscular synapses terminal schwann cells overlying the neuromuscular junction sprout elaborate processes upon muscle denervation. we show here that motor axons use these processes as guides/substrates during regeneration; in so doing, they escape the confines of endplates and grow between endplates to generate polyneuronal innervation. we also show that schwann cells in the nerve provide similar guidance. axons extend from the cut end of a nerve in association with schwann cell processes and appear to navigate along them. the processes extend from axotomized nerves at the same rate and in the same manner as they do from axon-containing nerves. the rate of process extension limits the rate at which axons regenerate. thus, schwann cell processes lead and guide peripheral regeneration.
the six metal binding domains in human copper transporter, atp7b: molecular biophysics and disease-causing mutations backgroundwilson﻿'s disease ﻿with﻿ osseomuscular type is a rare condition, which often lacks typical hepatic and neurological symptoms and causes misdiagnoses easily. during the past 10 years, eight chinese patients of osseomuscular type of wilson's disease were identified in our clinic.methodsclinical information was gathered from medical records and follow-ups. the genetic testing was performed in each patient. serum ceruloplasmin, kayser-fleischer rings, liver function, brain magnetic resonance imaging and abdominal ultrasonography were also evaluated.resultsthe median age of onset is 12 years of age. the patients had their initial musculoskeletal conditions with arthralgia or joint deformity, while the hepatic or neurologic signs were minimal. most patients (6/8) eventually developed clinical neurological symptoms afterwards with a median interval of 36 months. all of them had normal liver function and low serum ceruloplasmin (<0.1 g/l). most patients (6/8) present with kayser-fleischer rings and abnormal hepatic ultrasonography. the arthralgia was resolved with copper chelation therapy.conclusionswilson’s disease with osseomuscular type occurs without typical hepatic or neurological symptoms, which makes the clinical diagnosis challenging. serum ceruloplasmin, abdominal ultrasonography, ophthalmic examination and genetic testing help to establish the diagnosis. early diagnosis can initiate an effective treatment and prevent the further damage.
gastrin upregulates the prosurvival factor secretory clusterin in adenocarcinoma cells and in oxyntic mucosa of hypergastrinemic rats. gastrin was the second hormone to be postulated to exist (1) shortly after bayliss & starling (2) developed the concept of blood-borne chemical signal substances based upon their studies on the regulation of secretion of bicarbonate and water from the pancreas. gastrin was postulated to be released from the antral mucosa by food and to reach the oxyntic mucosa to stimulate acid secretion (1). many decades later, gastrin was purified, sequenced and synthesized (3) and shortly afterwards shown to be released by food (4) and to be a potent stimulator of acid secretion (5). the way gastrin stimulates the parietal cells to secrete acid has long been debated. it is now clear that gastrin stimulates acid secretion by inducing histamine release, which in turn stimulates acid secretion. this was shown as early as in the 1960s by kahlson et al. (6), and later by us, using isolated vascularly perfused rat stomach (7) or isolated oxyntic mucosal cells (8). the cellular source of the histamine taking part in the regulation of acid secretion is nowadays undisputed as the ecl cell (9, 10). by comparing the concentration response curves for gastrin and histamine, we could show that the acid stimulatory effect of gastrin could be solely explained by the stimulation of histamine release (11), which we also had shown previously in vascularly perfused isolated rat stomach (12) or isolated oxyntic mucosal cells (8). finally, by using a fluorescein labeled gastrin analogue, we could show that gastrin in physiological concentration only binds to the ecl cell and not to the parietal cell (13). in addition to stimulation of acid secretion, gastrin also has an undisputed positive trophic effect on the oxyntic mucosa (14). there is, however, a disproportionate trophic effect on the ecl cell (15). whether there is a gastrin receptor on the exocrine mucosal stem cell in the oxyntic mucosa (16) or not (17), has not yet been settled. the general trophic effect of gastrin on the oxyntic mucosa may be indirectly mediated by ecl-cell-derived reg protein (18). a gastrin receptor has also been localized to the c cells in the thyroid (19) and to tumors originating from this cell (19, 20), as well as to tumors originating from neuroendocrine cells in the lungs (21). the biological importance of these receptors has not been clarified, although pentagastrin-stimulated calcitonin release has previously been used in the diagnosis of medullary thyroid carcinoma (22). in the normal colon where gastrin does not influence mucosal growth (23), no gastrin receptor has been described. there have, however, been reports describing gastrin receptor in colonic carcinoma (24), but a relationship between gastrin and colonic carcinomas has not yet been confirmed, despite being the subject of debate for more than a decade. furthermore, a physiological or pathophysiological role of progastrins including glycine-extended gastrin (25) has not been confirmed. the present review on hypergastrinemia will accordingly only focus on amidated gastrin and the principal target organ for gastrin, the oxyntic mucosa.
clinical information retrieval using document and pico structure background information retrieval in primary care is becoming more difficult as the volume of medical information held in electronic databases expands. the lexical structure of this information might permit automatic indexing and improved retrieval.   objective to determine the possibility of identifying the key elements of clinical studies, namely patient-population-problem, exposure-intervention, comparison, outcome, duration and results (pecodr), from abstracts of medical journals.   methods we used a convenience sample of 20 synopses from the journal evidence-based medicine (ebm) and their matching original journal article abstracts obtained from pubmed. three independent primary care professionals identified pecodr-related extracts of text. rules were developed to define each pecodr element and the selection process of characters, words, phrases and sentences. from the extracts of text related to pecodr elements, potential lexical patterns that might help identify those elements were proposed and assessed using nvivo software.   results a total of 835 pecodr-related text extracts containing 41,263 individual text characters were identified from 20 ebm journal synopses. there were 759 extracts in the corresponding pubmed abstracts containing 31,947 characters. pecodr elements were found in nearly all abstracts and synopses with the exception of duration. there was agreement on 86.6% of the extracts from the 20 ebm synopses and 85.0% on the corresponding pubmed abstracts. after consensus this rose to 98.4% and 96.9% respectively. we found potential text patterns in the comparison, outcome and results elements of both ebm synopses and pubmed abstracts. some phrases and words are used frequently and are specific for these elements in both synopses and abstracts.   conclusions results suggest a pecodr-related structure exists in medical abstracts and that there might be lexical patterns specific to these elements. more sophisticated computer-assisted lexical-semantic analysis might refine these results, and pave the way to automating pecodr indexing, and improve information retrieval in primary care.

the nature and meaning of identity in retired professional women this study examined narrative identity in 2 groups of participants who were younger (ages ranging from late adolescence through young adulthood) and older (over the age of 65 years). participants completed an extensive interview in which they reported three self-defining memories. interviews were coded for several characteristics of autobiographical reasoning: self-event connections representing self-stability or self-change, event-event connections, reflective processing, and thematic coherence. results showed that the older and younger groups were not different in terms of the frequencies of self-event connections or the levels of reflective processing. however, in comparison with the younger group, the older group had more thematic coherence and more stories representing stability, whereas the younger group had more stories representing change. gender differences also emerged, suggesting that females may have an advantage in the development of narrative identity. results are discussed in terms of the different ways to represent narrative identity at 2 ends of the life span.

structured output prediction for semantic perception in autonomous vehicles autonomous driving is a key factor for future mobility. properly perceiving the environment of the vehicles is essential for a safe driving, which requires computing accurate geometric and semantic information in real-time. in this paper, we challenge state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms for building a perception system for autonomous driving. an inherent drawback in the computation of visual semantics is the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. we propose to circumvent this problem by following an offline-online strategy. during the offline stage dense 3d semantic maps are created. in the online stage the current driving area is recognized in the maps via a re-localization process, which allows to retrieve the pre-computed accurate semantics and 3d geometry in real-time. then, detecting the dynamic obstacles we obtain a rich understanding of the current scene. we evaluate quantitatively our proposal in the kitti dataset and discuss the related open challenges for the computer vision community.
genuine genetic redundancy in maleylacetate-reductase-encoding genes involved in degradation of haloaromatic compounds by cupriavidus necator jmp134. the maleylacetate reductase from pseudomonas sp. strain b13 functioning in the modified ortho pathway was purified and digested with trypsin. the polypeptides separated by high-performance liquid chromatography were sequenced. alignments with the polypeptides predicted from the tfdf and tcbf genes located on plasmids pjp4 of the 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate-degrading alcaligenes eutrophus jmp134 and pp51 of the 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene-degrading pseudomonas sp. strain p51 as well as polypeptides predicted from the tfte gene located on the chromosome of the 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetate-degrading burkholderia cepacia ac1100 were obtained. in addition, the deduced protein sequence encoded by the nucleotide sequence downstream of clcd on plasmid pac27 of the 3-chlorobenzoate-degrading pseudomonas putida ac866 was tested for homology. significant sequence similarities with the polypeptides encoded by the tfdf, tcbf, and tfte genes as well as the nucleotide sequence downstream of the clcd gene gave evidence that these genes might encode maleylacetate reductases. a nad-binding motif in a beta alpha beta-element was detected.
comparative investigation of kidney mesangial cells from increased oxidative stress-induced diabetic rats by using different microscopy techniques aims/hypothesis. we examined whether endothelial function is impaired in patients with type i (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus under conditions of near-normoglycaemia compared with age-matched healthy control subjects. our aim was to determine whether microalbuminuria is associated with endothelial dysfunction in type i diabetes. methods. endothelial function, measured as post-ischaemic flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery using ultrasound, was compared among 17 microalbuminuric and 17 normoalbuminuric diabetic patients, and 17 control subjects. glyceryl trinitrate-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery was used to measure endothelium-independent function. all diabetic patients were studied at near-normoglycaemia, using insulin and 5 % dextrose infusions to maintain blood glucose between 3.5 and 8.0 mmol/l. results. flow-mediated dilatation was significantly lower in microalbuminuric diabetic patients (3.2 ± 0.3 %) compared with normoalbuminuric diabetic patients (5.4 ± 0.6 %) and control subjects (7.9 ± 0.6 %, p < 0.001). normoalbuminuric diabetic patients also had significantly lower flow-mediated dilatation than control subjects (p = 0.01). glyceryl trinitrate mediated dilatation was significantly lower in the microalbuminuric patients compared with the control subjects (11.9 ± 1.1 % vs 20.0 ± 1.2 %, p = 0.001). albumin excretion rate and glycated haemoglobin showed a significant negative independent correlation with flow-mediated dilatation (both p < 0.05). conclusion/interpretation. type i diabetic patients show endothelial dysfunction at near-normoglycaemia compared with the control subjects, and this abnormality is more marked in diabetic patients with microalbuminuria. endothelial dysfunction in type i diabetes is related to the albumin excretion rate and glycaemic control. the presence of endothelial dysfunction in normoalbuminuric diabetic patients suggests it could precede microalbuminuria as an early risk marker for cardiovascular disease.

investigating genome wide patterns of natural selection in eukaryotes the distribution of fitness effects of new mutations is a fundamental parameter in genetics. here we present a new method by which the distribution can be estimated. the method is fairly robust to changes in population size and admixture, and it can be corrected for any residual effects if a model of the demography is available. we apply the method to extensively sampled single-nucleotide polymorphism data from humans and estimate the distribution of fitness effects for amino acid changing mutations. we show that a gamma distribution with a shape parameter of 0.23 provides a good fit to the data and we estimate that >50% of mutations are likely to have mild effects, such that they reduce fitness by between one one-thousandth and one-tenth. we also infer that <15% of new mutations are likely to have strongly deleterious effects. we estimate that on average a nonsynonymous mutation reduces fitness by a few percent and that the average strength of selection acting against a nonsynonymous polymorphism is ∼9 × 10−5. we argue that the relaxation of natural selection due to modern medicine and reduced variance in family size is not likely to lead to a rapid decline in genetic quality, but that it will be very difficult to locate most of the genes involved in complex genetic diseases.
colorectal cancer heterogeneity and targeted therapy: a case for molecular disease subtypes. purpose: the outcome of patients with colorectal cancer is more favorable when the tumor exhibits high-frequency microsatellite instability (msi). although associated with earlier-stage tumors, msi has been proposed as an independent predictor of survival. we tested the prognostic value of msi in a large series of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer in the last decade. experimental design: the survival of 893 consecutive patients with colorectal cancer characterized by microsatellite status was analyzed. the 89 (10%) patients with msi cancer were classified according to tumor mismatch repair (mmr) defect, mmr germ-line mutation, hmlh1 and p16 promoter methylation, braf and k-ras mutations, and frameshifts of target genes. results: the colorectal cancer–specific survival was significantly (p = 0.02) better in patients with msi cancer than in those with stable tumor (mss). msi did not predict a significantly lower risk of cancer-related death if tumor stage was included in the multivariate analysis [hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval (95% ci), 0.40-1.29; p = 0.27]. instead, msi was strongly associated with a decreased likelihood of lymph node (odds ratio, 0.31; 95% ci, 0.17-0.56; p < 0.001) and distant organ (odds ratio, 0.13; 95% ci, 0.05-0.33; p < 0.001) metastases at diagnosis, independently of tumor pathologic features. molecular predictors of reduced metastatic risk, and then of more favorable prognosis, included tgfβrii mutation for all msi tumors, hmsh2 deficiency for hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, and absence of p16 methylation for sporadic hmlh1-deficient cancers. conclusions: tumor msi is a stage-dependent predictor of survival in patients with colorectal cancer. the decreased likelihood of metastases in patients with msi cancer is associated with specific genetic and epigenetic changes of the primary tumor.
back to basics – the influence of dna extraction and primer choice on phylogenetic analysis of activated sludge communities standardization of dna extraction is a fundamental issue of fidelity and comparability in investigations of environmental microbial communities. commercial kits for soil or feces are often adopted for studies of activated sludge because of a lack of specific kits, but they have never been evaluated regarding their effectiveness and potential biases based on high throughput sequencing. in this study, seven common dna extraction kits were evaluated, based on not only yield/purity but also sequencing results, using two activated sludge samples (two sub-samples each, i.e. ethanol-fixed and fresh, as-is). the results indicate that the bead-beating step is necessary for dna extraction from activated sludge. the two kits without the bead-beating step yielded very low amounts of dna, and the least abundant operational taxonomic units (otus), and significantly underestimated the gram-positive actinobacteria, nitrospirae, chloroflexi, and alphaproteobacteria and overestimated gammaproteobacteria, deltaproteobacteria, bacteroidetes, and the rare phyla whose cell walls might have been readily broken. among the other five kits, fastdna@ spin kit for soil extracted the most and the purest dna. although the number of total otus obtained using this kit was not the highest, the abundant otus and abundance of actinobacteria demonstrated its efficiency. the three mobio kits and one zr kit produced fair results, but had a relatively low dna yield and/or less actinobacteria-related sequences. moreover, the 50 % ethanol fixation increased the dna yield, but did not change the sequenced microbial community in a significant way. based on the present study, the fastdna spin kit for soil is recommended for dna extraction of activated sludge samples. more importantly, the selection of the dna extraction kit must be done carefully if the samples contain dominant lysing-resistant groups, such as actinobacteria and nitrospirae.
cytosolic activation of cathepsins mediates parvovirus h-1-induced killing of cisplatin and trail-resistant glioma cells several studies concerning the distribution of ubiquinone (uq) in the cell report a preferential accumulation of this biogenic quinone in mitochondria, plasma membranes, golgi vesicles, and lysosomes. except for mitochondria, no recent comprehensive experimental evidence exists on the particular function of uq in these subcellular organelles. the aim of a recent study was to elucidate whether uq is an active part of an electron-transfer system in lysosomes. in the present work, a lysosomal fraction was prepared from a light mitochondrial fraction of rat liver by isopycnic centrifugation. the purity of our preparation was verified by estimation of the respective marker enzymes. analysis of lysosomes for putative redox carriers and redox processes in lysosomes was carried out by optical spectroscopy, hplc, oxymetry, and esr techniques. uq was detected in an amount of 2.2 nmol/mg of protein in lysosomes. furthermore, a b-type cytochrome and a flavin-adenine dinucleotide (fad) were identified as other potential electron carriers. since nadh was reported to serve as a substrate of uq redox chains in plasma membranes, we also tested this reductant in lysosomes. our experiments demonstrate a nadh-dependent reduction of uq by two subsequent one-electron-transfer steps giving rise to the presence of ubisemiquinone and an increase of the ubiquinol pool in lysosomes. lysosomal nadh oxidation was accompanied by an approximately equimolar oxygen consumption, suggesting that o(2) acts as a terminal acceptor of this redox chain. dmpo/(*)oh spin adducts were detected by esr in nadh-supplemented lysosomes, suggesting a univalent reduction of oxygen. the kinetic analysis of redox changes in lysosomes revealed that electron carriers operate in the sequence nadh > fad > cytochrome b > ubiquinone > oxygen. by using the basic spin label tempamine, we showed that the nadh-related redox chain in lysosomes supports proton accumulation in lysosomes. in contrast to the hypothesis that uq in lysosomes is simply a waste product of autophagy in the cell, we demonstrated that this lipophilic electron carrier is a native constituent of a lysosomal electron transport chain, which promotes proton translocation across the lysosomal membrane.
inhibition of gli, but not smoothened, induces apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells this corrects the article doi: 10.1038/nature07737
investigating factors influencing consumer willingness to buy gm food and nano-food nanotechnology is increasingly being employed in the areas of food production and packaging. public perception will be crucial to the realization of these technological advances. we examined how lay people (n=153) perceive nanotechnology foods and nanotechnology food packaging, and we examined the factors that influence willingness to buy these products. participants received some general information about nanotechnology, and specific information about four nanotechnology applications. overall, participants were hesitant to buy nanotechnology foods or food with nanotechnology packaging. results suggest, however, that nanotechnology packaging is perceived as being more beneficial than nanotechnology foods. results further suggest that social trust in the food industry is an important factor directly influencing the affect evoked by these new products. as suggested by the affect heuristic, affect had an impact on perceived benefits and perceived risks. perceived benefit seems to be the most important predictor for willingness to buy.
analytical differences in the economics of geography: the case of the multinational firm this paper develops a theory of the allocation of formal authority (the right to decide) and real authority (the effective control over decisions) within organizations, and it illustrates how a formally integrated structure can accommodate various degrees of "real" integration. real authority is determined by the structure of information, which in turn depends on the allocation of formal authority. an increase in an agent's real authority promotes initiative but results in a loss of control for the principal. after spelling out (some of) the main determinants of the delegation of formal authority within organizations, the paper examines a number of factors that increase the subordinates' real authority in a formally integrated structure: overload, lenient rules, urgency of decision, reputation, performance measurement, and multiplicity of superiors. finally, the amount of communication in an organization is shown to depend on the allocation of formal authority.
application of constructed wetlands for treating agricultural runoff and agro-industrial wastewater: a review subsurface horizontal flow reed beds are being evaluated for nitrogen (n) and phosphorus (p) removal from plant nursery runoff water in new south wales australia. the need to include plants (phragmites australis), the effect of reaction time (3.5 v 7.0 d) and dissolved organic carbon (doc) on n and p removal in batch fed gravel wetland tubs (55 l) was studied over 19 months. simulated nursery runoff water containing n (10.1 mg l(-1), 74% as no3) and p (0.58 mg l(-1), 88% as po4) and doc (2-5 mg l(-1)) was used. the planted wetland tubs removed >96% tn and tp over most of the 19-month study period while unplanted tubs were inefficient (<16% n and <45% p removal) and occasionally discharged nutrients. doubling the reaction time to 7.0 days had no effect on nutrient removal. plant nutrient uptake accounted for most of the n (76%) and p (86%) removed while roots and rhizomes were the dominant sink (n 58%, p 67%). the addition of methanol (c:n-3:1) to unplanted tubs achieved 81-98% n removal. in carbon limited low nutrient nursery runoff, plants were essential to a gravel-based wetland to achieve efficient nutrient removal with effluent tn and tp concentrations of <1 mg l(-1) and 0.05 mg l(-1), respectively with a 3.5 day reaction time.
assessing biodiversity integrity for the conservation of grazed and burnt grassland systems: avian field metabolic rates as a rapid assessment tool in this study, we investigated the responses of two faunal groups, birds and arthropods, to varying degrees of disturbance caused by fire and grazing in south africa, eight study sites of varying fire frequency and stocking density were studied over two summer seasons (october–march). bird assemblages reflected habitat disturbance in a diversity of ways, driven by factors ranging from direct disturbance to changes in habitat structure and functioning, and shifts in food availability. similarly, arthropod diversity and abundance changed seasonally in response to management practices. fire frequency drives faunal assemblage structure and abundance and, in most cases, overrides the effects of grazing at all taxonomic levels. in particular, fire frequency strongly influenced grassland-breeding birds because farms are burnt in the territory-forming stage of the breeding cycle. insectivores and nectarivores were disproportionately impacted by intensive commercial management. of particular concern in this system is the yellow-breasted pipit (anthus chloris), which is regionally and globally vulnerable because of habitat loss. this species is sensitive to any form of habitat disturbance, highlighting the need for conservation attention in these grasslands. of the ten arthropod orders present in the study area, only orthoptera responded positively to burning. however, orthopterans made up on average 78% of arthropod biomass in moist highland grasslands, resulting in high grasshopper biomass on annually burnt farms: this high biomass in turn supports an abundance of insectivores. this reinforces the importance of process-oriented data where a measure of performance, such as reproductive success, is considered in assessing ecosystem condition.
lung cancer screening with low-dose helical ct in korea: experiences at the samsung medical center purpose because efficacy of lung cancer screening using chest x-ray is controversial and insufficient, other screening modalities need to be developed. to provide data on screening performance of low-dose helical computed tomography (ct) scanning and its efficacy in terms of survival, a one-arm longitudinal screening project was conducted.   patients and methods a total of 1,611 asymptomatic patients aged 40 to 79 years, 86% with smoking history, were screened by low-dose helical ct scan, chest x-ray, and 3-day pooled sputum cytology with a 6-month interval.   results at initial screening, the proportions of positive tests were 11.5%, 3.4%, and 0.8% with low-dose helical ct scan, chest x-ray, and sputum cytology, respectively. in 1,611 participants, 14 (0.87%) cases of lung cancer were detected, with 71% being stage ia disease and a mean tumor diameter of 19.8 mm. at repeated screening, the proportions of positive tests were 9.1%, 2.6%, and 0.7% with low-dose helical ct, chest x-ray, and sputum cytology, respectively. in 7,891 examinations, 22 (0.28%) cases of lung cancer were detected, with 82% being stage ia disease and a mean tumor diameter of 14.6 mm. the 5-year survival rate for screen-detected lung cancer was 76.2% and 64.9% for initial and repeated screening, respectively.   conclusion screening with low-dose helical ct has potential to improve screening efficacy in terms of reducing lung cancer mortality. an evaluation of efficacy using appropriate methods is urgently required.
a sustainability assessment of a health equity fund initiative in cambodia. sustainability continues to be a serious concern for primary health care (phc) interventions targeting the death of millions of children in developing countries each year. our work with over 30 non-governmental organizations (ngos) implementing usaid's child survival and health grants program (cshgp)-funded projects revealed the need for a study to develop a framework for sustainability assessment in these projects. we surveyed ngo informants and project managers through semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. this paper summarizes our study findings. the ngos share key values about sustainability, but are skeptical about approaches perceived as disconnected from field reality. in their experience, sustainable achievements occur through the interaction of capable local stakeholders and communities. this depends strongly on enabling conditions, which ngo projects should advance. sustainability assessment is multidimensional, value-based and embeds health within a larger sustainable development perspective. it reduces, but does not eliminate, the unpredictability of long-term outcomes. it should start with the consideration of the 'local systems' which need to develop a common purpose. our ability to address the complexity inherent to sustainability thinking rests with the validity of the models used to design interventions. a participant, qualitative research approach helped us make sense of sustainability in ngo field practice.
aliskiren has chondroprotective efficacy in a rat model of osteoarthritis through suppression of the local renin-angiotensin system we examined the effects of angiotensin ii (ang ii) on the differentiation of rat calvarial osteoblastic cells and on the formation of bone by these cells. northern blotting analysis revealed that ang ii inhibited the expression of mrna for osteocalcin, which is a protein that is specifically expressed during maturation of osteoblastic cells. ang ii decreased the activity of alkaline phosphatase, a marker of osteoblastic differentiation, in the cells, acting via the type 1 (at1) receptor. we used von kossa staining to examine the formation of mineralized nodules by osteoblastic cells. both the number and the total area of mineralized nodules were quantified and shown to be decreased by 10(-7) m ang ii. the accumulation of calcium in cells and the matrix layer was also decreased by ang ii. binding analysis with subtype-specific antagonists revealed the presence of at1 receptors for ang ii in this culture system. ang ii caused a marked increase in the rate of production of intracellular camp in this system. our data suggest that ang ii might be intimately involved in osteoblastic metabolism through its interaction with the at1 receptor.
arterial pressure: agreement between a brachial cuff-based device and radial tonometry aims brachial systolic blood pressure (bsbp) exceeds aortic pressure by a variable amount, and estimated central systolic blood pressure (csbp) may be a better indicator of cardiovascular risk than bsbp. we undertook a systematic review and meta‐analysis to compare the effect of single and multiple antihypertensive agents on bsbp, csbp and augmentation index (aix).
emergency department use by released prisoners with hiv: an observational longitudinal study the 16-item quick inventory of depressive symptomatology (qids), a new measure of depressive symptom severity derived from the 30-item inventory of depressive symptomatology (ids), is available in both self-report (qids-sr(16)) and clinician-rated (qids-c(16)) formats. this report evaluates and compares the psychometric properties of the qids-sr(16) in relation to the ids-sr(30) and the 24-item hamilton rating scale for depression (ham-d(24)) in 596 adult outpatients treated for chronic nonpsychotic, major depressive disorder. internal consistency was high for the qids-sr(16) (cronbach's alpha =.86), the ids-sr(30) (cronbach's alpha =.92), and the ham-d(24) (cronbach's alpha =.88). qids-sr(16) total scores were highly correlated with ids-sr(30) (.96) and ham-d(24) (.86) total scores. item-total correlations revealed that several similar items were highly correlated with both qids-sr(16) and ids-sr(30) total scores. roughly 1.3 times the qids-sr(16) total score is predictive of the ham-d(17) (17-item version of the ham-d) total score. the qids-sr(16) was as sensitive to symptom change as the ids-sr(30) and ham-d(24), indicating high concurrent validity for all three scales. the qids-sr(16) has highly acceptable psychometric properties, which supports the usefulness of this brief rating of depressive symptom severity in both clinical and research settings.
anatomical features associated with venous congestion in diep flap using ct angiography with three-dimensional reconstruction background: despite improving outcomes, venous problems in the harvest of deep inferior epigastric artery perforator (diep) flaps remain the more common vascular complications. however, it is apparent that the venous anatomy of the anterior abdominal wall has not been described to the same extent as the arterial anatomy. previous anatomical studies have focused on cadaveric anatomy or excisional specimens. the current study uses in vivo computed tomographic angiography to evaluate this anatomy, in combination with a cadaveric radiographic study. methods: both cadaveric and in vivo studies were undertaken using eight whole fresh cadaveric specimens (16 sides) and 100 patients undergoing diep flap breast reconstruction (200 sides). the cadaveric component used direct catheter venography and the in vivo studies were undertaken using preoperative computed tomographic angiography, mapping in vivo venous flow. results: the location, caliber, course, and distribution of the superficial and deep inferior epigastric veins were recorded. the dominance of each system and their direction of drainage were described. mechanisms for poor venous drainage were postulated, including perforator size, midline crossover of the superficial inferior epigastric vein, and the superficial and deep inferior epigastric vein communications. the incidence of each of these anatomical factors was evaluated. conclusion: the cause of venous compromise is multifactorial, with the current study showing that preoperative computed tomographic angiography may predict venous problems during flap harvest, by demonstrating perforator diameter, midline crossover, and deep-superficial venous communications.
new strategies for increasing heterozygosity in crops: vicia faba mating system as a study case estimates of single and multilocus outcrossing rates as well as relatedness among progeny of individual seed trees were obtained for 14 populations of pecan [carya illinoinensis (wangenh.) k. koch]. mean outcrossing estimates were not significantly different from 1.0 and relatedness values indicate that most progeny within families are half sibs. biparental inbreeding was insignificant in all study sites, and inbreeding coefficients indicated that populations were close to inbreeding equilibrium.
coordinated protein and dna remodeling by human hltf on stalled replication fork we have constructed simian virus 40 minireplicons containing uniquely placed cis,syn-thymine dimers (t <> t) for the analysis of leading- and lagging-strand bypass replication. assaying for replication in a human cell-free extract through the analysis of full-size labeled product molecules and restriction fragments spanning the t <> t site resulted in the following findings: (i) the primary site of synthesis blockage with t <> t in either the leading or lagging strand was one nucleotide before the lesion. (ii) replicative bypass of t <> t was detected in both leading and lagging strands. the efficiency of synthesis past t <> t was 22% for leading-strand t <> t and 13% for lagging-strand t <> t. (iii) the lagging-strand t <> t resulted in blocked retrograde synthesis with the replication fork proceeding past the lesion, resulting in daughter molecules containing small gaps (form ii' dna). (iv) with t <> t in the leading-strand template, both the leading and lagging strands were blocked, representing a stalled replication fork. uncoupling of the concerted synthesis of the two strands of the replication fork was observed, resulting in preferential elongation of the undamaged lagging strand. these data support a model of selective reinitiation downstream from the lesion on lagging strands due to okazaki synthesis, with no reinitiation close to the damage site on leading strands [meneghini, r. & hanawalt, p.c. (1976) biochim. biophys. acta 425, 428-437].
reciprocal regulation of microrna-99a and insulin-like growth factor i receptor signaling in oral squamous cell carcinoma cells background: microrna-99a markedly decreases in hcc. results: microrna-99a expression correlates with hcc patients' survival, and microrna-99a restoration suppresses hcc growth in vitro and in vivo by targeting igf-1r and mtor. conclusions: microrna-99a could be prognosis predictor and tumor suppressor for hcc. significance: reveal the important role of microrna-99a in hcc development and provide prognosis predictor and therapeutic approach for hcc. in our in-depth analysis carried out by the illumina solexa massive parallel signature sequencing, microrna-99a (mir-99a) was found to be the sixth abundant microrna in the mirnome of normal human liver but was markedly down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). compelling evidence has suggested the important roles of micrornas in hcc development. however, the biological function of mir-99a deregulation in hcc remains unknown. in this study, we found that mir-99a was remarkably decreased in hcc tissues and cell lines. importantly, lower mir-99a expression in hcc tissues significantly correlated with shorter survival of hcc patients, and mir-99a was identified to be an independent predictor for the prognosis of hcc patients. furthermore, restoration of mir-99a dramatically suppressed hcc cell growth in vitro by inducing the g1 phase cell cycle arrest. intratumoral injection of cholesterol-conjugated mir-99a mimics significantly inhibited tumor growth and reduced the α-fetoprotein level in hcc-bearing nude mice. insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (igf-1r) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) were further characterized as the direct targets of mir-99a. furthermore, protein levels of igf-1r and mtor were found to be inversely correlated with mir-99a expression in hcc tissues. mir-99a mimics inhibited igf-1r and mtor pathways and subsequently suppressed expression of cell cycle-related proteins, including cyclin d1 in hcc cells. conclusively, mir-99a expression was frequently down-regulated in hcc tissues and correlates with the prognosis of hcc patients, thus proposing mir-99a as a prospective prognosis predictor of hcc. mir-99a suppresses hcc growth by inducing cell cycle arrest, suggesting mir-99a as potential tumor suppressor for hcc therapeutics.
visual acuity versus letter contrast sensitivity in early cataract does the color of text influence its legibility? there are reasons why it may do so for specific groups of low-vision observers. we used psychophysical methods to measure the effects of wavelength on the reading performance of four normal observers, two dichromats, and twenty-five low-vision observers. reading rates were measured for text scanned across the face of a television (tv) monitor. we compared performance under four luminance-matched conditions in which sets of neutral-density and wratten color filters were placed in front of the tv screen--blue (lambda max = 430 nm), green (lambda max = 550 nm), red (lambda max = 650 nm), and gray. under photopic conditions, the reading rates of normal subjects were independent of wavelength, with the exception of characters near the acuity limit. at lower luminances, wavelength effects could be explained by the shift from photopic to scotopic vision. it was hypothesized that light scatter or absorption in eyes with cloudy ocular media would result in depressed performance in the blue. only one of seven subjects demonstrated this effect, which we traced to wavelength-specific absorption. observers with advanced photoreceptor disorders tended to read blue text faster than red text. this could not be explained on the basis of photopic spectral sensitivities alone. finally, the presence of central or peripheral field loss was not predictive of wavelength-specific effects in reading. on the whole, wavelength only occasionally plays a significant role in reading. when it does, performance tends to be depressed either in the red or the blue and to be nearly optimal for green or gray.
probing into the mechanism of alkaline citrus extract promoted apoptosis in pulmonary fibroblasts of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mice paraquat (pq) is a widely used herbicide indeveloping countries worldwide, and pulmonary fibrosis is one of the most typical features of pq poisoning. the molecular mechanism of pq toxicity especially how to treat pq-induced pulmonary fibrosis is still largely unknown. in animal model of pulmonary fibrosis, we used he staining, western blotting assay and real-time pcr assay to analyze the effects of rapamycin on the pq-induced epithelial mesenchymal transition (emt). we found that pq induced the pulmonary fibrosis using he staining and masson's staining, and up-regulated the activity of hyp and the mrna expressions of collagen i and iii (col-1and col-3) in pulmonary tissues. we also found that rapamycin down-regulated the mesenchymal cell marker vimentin and up-regulated the epithelial cell marker e-cadherin both in mrna and protein levels compared with pq group. and the emt associated transcription factor snail was decreased by rapamycin treatment compared with pq group. and pq decreased the nrf2 expression both in mrna and protein levels, and rapamycin inhibited these effects of pq. sfn, a activator of nrf2, could inhibit the emt and the expression of snail. and knockdowon of nrf2 could abolish the inhibitory effects of rapamycin of pq-induced emt. in conclusion, rapamycin protects against paraquat-induced pulmonary fibrosis by activation of nrf2 signaling pathway.
the relevance of applying exercise training principles when designing therapeutic interventions for patients with inflammatory myopathies: a systematic review the cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions is the official document that describes in detail the process of preparing and maintaining cochrane systematic reviews on the effects of healthcare interventions.
a functional vipa-vipb interaction is required for the type vi secretion system activity of vibrio cholerae o1 strain a1552 the bacterium vibrio cholerae, like other human pathogens that reside in environmental reservoirs, survives predation by unicellular eukaryotes. strains of the o1 and o139 serogroups cause cholera, whereas non-o1/non-o139 strains cause human infections through poorly defined mechanisms. using dictyostelium discoideum as a model host, we have identified a virulence mechanism in a non-o1/non-o139 v. cholerae strain that involves extracellular translocation of proteins that lack n-terminal hydrophobic leader sequences. accordingly, we have named these genes “vas” genes for virulence-associated secretion, and we propose that these genes encode a prototypic “type vi” secretion system. we show that vas genes are required for cytotoxicity of v. cholerae cells toward dictyostelium amoebae and mammalian j774 macrophages by a contact-dependent mechanism. a large number of gram-negative bacterial pathogens carry genes homologous to vas genes and potential effector proteins secreted by this pathway (i.e., hemolysin-coregulated protein and vgrg). mutations in vas homologs in other bacterial species have been reported to attenuate virulence in animals and cultured macrophages. thus, the genes encoding the vas-related, type vi secretion system likely play an important conserved function in microbial pathogenesis and represent an additional class of targets for vaccine and antimicrobial drug-based therapies.
prediction of ovarian cancer prognosis and response to chemotherapy by a serum-based multiparametric biomarker panel epithelial ovarian cancer constitutes one-quarter of the gynecologic malignancies, but is the leading cause of death among women with gynecologic cancer. in 6070% of the women, the disease is detected at a late stage when 5-year survival is poor. the recommended primary therapeutic approach for ovarian cancer is aggressive primarydebulking surgery followed by combination chemotherapy. the efficacy is routinely evaluated by repeated vaginal examination and transabdominal ultrasonography. however, these methods are unreliable for monitoring as progressive and recurrent disease often remains hidden until the patient presents with a large tumor mass. over the last few decades a variety of serological tumor markers has been proposed as a supplement to other non-invasive diagnostic methods. the main issue with tumor marker measurements is to obtain reliable information about changes in tumor mass before the changes are detectable by other methods. however, despite several attempts to identify useful serological markers for epithelial ovarian cancer, the results have not been as encouraging as for germ-cell tumors. the purpose of this paper is to review the applicability of ca 125, cea, tpa, tati, casa, and tetranectin in screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of ovarian carcinoma. several compounds other than those mentioned above are being investigated as markers in the early detection and management of ovarian cancer. some ofthese potential tumor markers listed in table 1 will not be discussed further in this review.
rating communication in gp consultations: the association between ratings made by patients and trained clinical raters background despite recent attention given to medical errors, little is known about the kinds and importance of medical errors in primary care. the principal aims of this study were to develop patient-focused typologies of medical errors and harms in primary care settings and to discern which medical errors and harms seem to be the most important. methods thirty-eight in-depth anonymous interviews of adults from rural, suburban, and urban locales in virginia and ohio were conducted to solicit stories of preventable problems with primary health care that led to physical or psychological harm. transcriptions were analyzed to identify, name, and organize the stories of errors and harms. results the 38 narratives described 221 problematic incidents that predominantly involved breakdowns in the clinician-patient relationship (n = 82, 37%) and access to clinicians (n = 63, 29%). there were several reports of perceived racism. the incidents were linked to 170 reported harms, 70% of which were psychological, including anger, frustration, belittlement, and loss of relationship and trust in one’s clinician. physical harms accounted for 23% of the total and included pain, bruising, worsening medical condition, and adverse drug reactions. discussion the errors reported by interviewed patients suggest that breakdowns in access to and relationships with clinicians may be more prominent medical errors than are technical errors in diagnosis and treatment. patients were more likely to report being harmed psychologically and emotionally, suggesting that the current preoccupation of the patient safety movement with adverse drug events and surgical mishaps could overlook other patient priorities.
reduced hemispheric asymmetry of brain anatomical networks in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder a growing body of work utilizing structural and functional brain imaging and neurocognitive measures of executive and attentional function indicates anomalous asymmetry in adhd. this study examined the white-matter volume and diffusion properties of frontostriatal tracts, as a function of hemisphere, in adhd and healthy controls. forty-three young males (21 adhd–combined type and 22 controls) aged 10–18 years underwent structural and diffusion weighted mri. tractography applying constrained spherical deconvolution (csd) was used to construct frontostriatal tracts between each of caudate and putamen and each of dorsolateral prefrontal, ventrolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices (dlpfc, vlpfc and ofc) in each hemisphere, to examine both volumetric and diffusion microstructure properties. young people with adhd did not show the right hemisphere lateralization of volume in the caudate-vlpfc and caudate-dlpfc tracts that was evident in controls, however the adhd group displayed a pronounced lateralization to the left for fractional anisotropy in the putamen-vlpfc tracts. the degree of volume asymmetry did not correlate with symptom severity; however fractional anisotropy (fa) values that were more strongly lateralized to the left in the putamen-vlpfc white matter were associated with greater symptom severity. adhd was associated with anomalous hemispheric asymmetries in both tract volume and underlying white-matter microstructure in major fibre tracts of the frontostriatal system. our observations of both weaker lateralization to the right in terms of tract volume and stronger lateralization to the left in terms of fa values for the adhd group, suggests that previous inconsistencies in the literature may reflect the influence of such asymmetries.
secure transmission and self-energy recycling with partial eavesdropper csi we consider a dual-hop full-duplex relaying system, where the energy constrained relay node is powered by radio frequency signals from the source using the time-switching architecture, both the amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward relaying protocols are studied. specifically, we provide an analytical characterization of the achievable throughput of three different communication modes, namely, instantaneous transmission, delay-constrained transmission, and delay tolerant transmission. in addition, the optimal time split is studied for different transmission modes. our results reveal that, when the time split is optimized, the full-duplex relaying could substantially boost the system throughput compared to the conventional half-duplex relaying architecture for all three transmission modes. in addition, it is shown that the instantaneous transmission mode attains the highest throughput. however, compared to the delay-constrained transmission mode, the throughput gap is rather small. unlike the instantaneous time split optimization which requires instantaneous channel state information, the optimal time split in the delay-constrained transmission mode depends only on the statistics of the channel, hence, is suitable for practical implementations.
a method for extracting a high-quality rna from symbiodinium sp. backgroundthe integrity of rna molecules is of paramount importance for experiments that try to reflect the snapshot of gene expression at the moment of rna extraction. until recently, there has been no reliable standard for estimating the integrity of rna samples and the ratio of 28s:18s ribosomal rna, the common measure for this purpose, has been shown to be inconsistent. the advent of microcapillary electrophoretic rna separation provides the basis for an automated high-throughput approach, in order to estimate the integrity of rna samples in an unambiguous way.methodsa method is introduced that automatically selects features from signal measurements and constructs regression models based on a bayesian learning technique. feature spaces of different dimensionality are compared in the bayesian framework, which allows selecting a final feature combination corresponding to models with high posterior probability.resultsthis approach is applied to a large collection of electrophoretic rna measurements recorded with an agilent 2100 bioanalyzer to extract an algorithm that describes rna integrity. the resulting algorithm is a user-independent, automated and reliable procedure for standardization of rna quality control that allows the calculation of an rna integrity number (rin).conclusionour results show the importance of taking characteristics of several regions of the recorded electropherogram into account in order to get a robust and reliable prediction of rna integrity, especially if compared to traditional methods.
clinical significance of serum hyaluronic acid level alteration in patient with nasopharyngeal carcinoma in this study, a hyaluronan-binding complex, which we termed metastatin, was isolated from bovine cartilage by affinity chromatography and found to have both antitumorigenic and antiangiogenic properties. metastatin was able to block the formation of tumor nodules in the lungs of mice inoculated with b16bl6 melanoma or lewis lung carcinoma cells. single i.v. administration of metastatin into chicken embryos inhibited the growth of both b16bl6 mouse melanoma and tsu human prostate cancer cells growing on the chorioallantoic membrane. the in vivo biological effect may be attributed to the antiangiogenic activity because metastatin is able to inhibit the migration and proliferation of cultured endothelial cells as well as vascular endothelial growth factor-induced angiogenesis on the chorioallantoic membrane. in each case, the effect could be blocked by either heat denaturing the metastatin or premixing it with hyaluronan, suggesting that its activity critically depends on its ability to bind hyaluronan on the target cells. collectively, these results suggest that metastatin is an effective antitumor agent that exhibits antiangiogenic activity.
the association of retinoic acid receptor beta2(rarβ2) methylation status and prostate cancer risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis background gene expression can be silenced through the methylation of specific sites in the promoter region. this mechanism of gene silencing has an important role in the carcinogenesis of prostate and other cancers. although tumor-associated stromal cells also exhibit changes in gene expression, promoter methylation has not been described in these cells.   methods tumor epithelia, tumor-associated stroma and normal epithelia, and stroma adjacent to tumor tissues were isolated from whole-mount prostatectomy specimens (two per patient) of patients (n = 5) with localized prostate cancer and from normal epithelia and stroma from benign prostate hyperplasia specimens (two per patient) from men (n = 5) without prostate cancer by using laser capture microdissection or expression microdissection. the methylation status of three genes important in prostate carcinogenesis, gstp1, rarbeta2, and cd44, were evaluated using quantitative methylation-sensitive polymerase chain reaction.   results gstp1 and rarbeta2 were methylated in the tumor epithelium of all five prostate cancer patients and in the tumor-associated stroma in four of the five patients. cd44 was methylated in the tumor epithelium from four of the five patients but not in the tumor stroma. gstp1 and rarbeta2 were methylated in normal epithelium of two and four patients, respectively, and in normal stroma of one and two patients, respectively, that were isolated from regions adjacent to the tumors and may have resulted from a tumor-field effect; cd44 methylation was not observed in normal epithelium or stroma. in contrast, normal epithelia and stroma from benign prostate hyperplasia specimens showed no promoter methylation in gstp1, rarbeta2, or cd44.   conclusions the observation of promoter methylation in the non-neoplastic cells of the prostate tumor microenvironment may advance our understanding of prostate cancer development and progression and lead to new diagnostic and prognostic markers and therapeutic targets.
a critical evaluation of the down syndrome diagnosis for lb1, type specimen of homo floresiensis introduction the purpose of this study was to assess the growth of the cranial base in a sample of patients diagnosed with down syndrome (ds).   methods the sample comprised 47 subjects (25 boys, 22 girls) with ds. all patients had at least 2 x-rays that showed the cranial base. to make comparisons among age groups, the sample was divided into 3 groups: prepubescent (8-11 years), pubescent (12-14 years), and postpubescent (15-18 years). a control group included 38 normal subjects (22 boys, 16 girls, without ds) who were part of a longitudinal growth sample. computerized cephalometric analysis was performed on all subjects, and cephalometric superimpositions were made. two-way anova was used to study the overall changes between groups. in addition, 1-way anova and the duncan multiple range test were used to analyze possible differences in the age groups.   results cranial base growth in patients with ds from age 8 to 18 was similar to that of the control group. structural differences in the cranial base are established before 8 years of age and consist of shorter, flatter anterior and posterior bases.
phylogeographical patterns shed light on evolutionary process in south america the making of amazonian diversity the biodiversity of the amazon basin is legendary, but the processes by which it has been generated have been debated. in the late 20th century the prevalent view was that the engine of diversity was repeated contraction and expansion of forest refugia during the past 3 million years or so. hoorn et al. (p. 927) analyze findings from a diverse range of disciplines, including molecular phylogeny, ecology, sedimentology, structural geology, and palaeontology, to offer an overview of the entire history of this region during the cenozoic era (66 million years ago). the uplift of the andes was a pivotal event in the evolution of amazonian landscapes because it continually altered river drainage patterns, which in turn put a variety of pressures on organisms to adapt to changing conditions in a multiplicity of ways. hence, the diversity of the modern biota of the amazon has more ancient origins than previously thought. the amazonian rainforest is arguably the most species-rich terrestrial ecosystem in the world, yet the timing of the origin and evolutionary causes of this diversity are a matter of debate. we review the geologic and phylogenetic evidence from amazonia and compare it with uplift records from the andes. this uplift and its effect on regional climate fundamentally changed the amazonian landscape by reconfiguring drainage patterns and creating a vast influx of sediments into the basin. on this “andean” substrate, a region-wide edaphic mosaic developed that became extremely rich in species, particularly in western amazonia. we show that andean uplift was crucial for the evolution of amazonian landscapes and ecosystems, and that current biodiversity patterns are rooted deep in the pre-quaternary.
referential choices in a collaborative storytelling task: discourse stages and referential complexity matter in this study, children, young adults and elderly adults were tested in production and comprehension tasks assessing referential choice. our aims were (1) to determine whether speakers egocentrically base their referential choice on the preceding linguistic discourse or also take into account the perspective of a hypothetical listener and (2) whether the possible impact of perspective taking on referential choice changes with increasing age, with its associated changes in cognitive capacity. in the production task, participants described picture-based stories featuring two characters of the same gender, making it necessary to use unambiguous forms; in the comprehension task, participants interpreted potentially ambiguous pronouns at the end of similar orally presented stories. young adults (aged 18–35) were highly sensitive to the informational needs of hypothetical conversational partners in their production and comprehension of referring expressions. in contrast, children (aged 4–7) did not take into account possible conversational partners and tended to use pronouns for all given referents, leading to the production of ambiguous pronouns that are unrecoverable for a listener. this was mirrored in the outcome of the comprehension task, where children were insensitive to the shift of discourse topic marked by the speaker. the elderly adults (aged 69–87) behaved differently from both young adults and children. they showed a clear sensitivity to the other person's perspective in both production and comprehension, but appeared to lack the necessary cognitive capacities to keep track of the prominence of discourse referents, producing more potentially ambiguous pronouns than young adults, though fewer than children. in conclusion then, referential choice seems to depend on perspective taking in language, which develops with increasing linguistic experience and cognitive capacity, but also on the ability to keep track of the prominence of discourse referents, which is gradually lost with older age.
contextual statistics of space-time ordered features for human action recognition local image features or interest points provide compact and abstract representations of patterns in an image. in this paper, we extend the notion of spatial interest points into the spatio-temporal domain and show how the resulting features often reflect interesting events that can be used for a compact representation of video data as well as for interpretation of spatio-temporal events.to detect spatio-temporal events, we build on the idea of the harris and förstner interest point operators and detect local structures in space-time where the image values have significant local variations in both space and time. we estimate the spatio-temporal extents of the detected events by maximizing a normalized spatio-temporal laplacian operator over spatial and temporal scales. to represent the detected events, we then compute local, spatio-temporal, scale-invariant n-jets and classify each event with respect to its jet descriptor. for the problem of human motion analysis, we illustrate how a video representation in terms of local space-time features allows for detection of walking people in scenes with occlusions and dynamic cluttered backgrounds.
apicidin down-regulates human papillomavirus type 16 e6 and e7 transcripts and proteins in siha cervical cancer cells. summary. human papillomavirus type 16 (hpv-16) e5 protein, along with the more publicized e6 and e7 proteins of this virus, has been found to be oncogenic. e5 is a highly hydrophobic membrane-bound protein of 83 amino acids associated with the golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclear membrane in infected cells. e5 can activate epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) through binding to the 16 kd subunit of protein pump atpase leading to a reduced downregulation of egfr receptors. the activation of egfr can initiate biochemical cascades that lead to overexpression of a variety of protooncogenes and stimulate rapid cell growth. moreover, e5 can inhibit the expression of tumor suppressor gene p21(wafi/sdii/cipi) and impair the control of cell cycle checkpoint. e5 protein has been identified as a potential tumor vaccine target antigen.
non-conscious modulation of cardiac defense by masked phobic pictures. if subjects are shown an angry face as a target visual stimulus for less than forty milliseconds and are then immediately shown an expressionless mask, these subjects report seeing the mask but not the target. however, an aversively conditioned masked target can elicit an emotional response from subjects without being consciously perceived,. here we study the mechanism of this unconsciously mediated emotional learning. we measured neural activity in volunteer subjects who were presented with two angry faces, one of which, through previous classical conditioning, was associated with a burst of white noise. in half of the trials, the subjects' awareness of the angry faces was prevented by backward masking with a neutral face. a significant neural response was elicited in the right, but not left, amygdala to masked presentations of the conditioned angry face. unmasked presentations of the same face produced enhanced neural activity in the left, but not right, amygdala. our results indicate that, first, the human amygdala can discriminate between stimuli solely on the basis of their acquired behavioural significance, and second, this response is lateralized according to the subjects' level of awareness of the stimuli.
integrated stratigraphy of the paleocene‐eocene thermal maximum in the new jersey coastal plain: toward understanding the effects of global warming in a shelf environment publisher summary this chapter focuses on the paleoceanographical proxies based on deep-sea benthic foraminiferal assemblage characteristics, and presents the following three proxy relationships that are promising: those between benthic foraminiferal faunas and benthic ecosystem oxygenation, export productivity, and deep-sea water mass characteristics. under most circumstances the composition of deep-sea benthic foraminiferal assemblages is controlled by a rather limited number of environmental factors. the available proxies based on benthic foraminiferal assemblage composition show that they have major potential, but further research is needed to add or improve the quantitative aspects. in many cases, such as bottom water oxygenation, and corg flux to the ocean floor, it can be done by significantly increasing the size of existing databases. in other cases such as periodicity of the organic flux, time series observations are necessary. a major obstacle is insufficient knowledge of the differences between recent and fossil faunas due to taphonomical alterations. this phenomenon, of importance for all paleoceanographic proxies, can to some extent be solved relatively easily in the case of foraminiferal assemblages by detailed studies of their vertical succession in sediments deposited in the last 5,000 years, when environmental conditions were probably rather invariable in many areas. proxies based on foraminiferal assemblage composition are fundamentally different from all geochemical proxies, and thus may provide independent reconstructions of essential oceanographic parameters.
stimulation of human cd4+ t lymphocytes via tlr3, tlr5 and tlr7/8 up-regulates expression of costimulatory and modulates proliferation the toll-like receptor (tlr)9 is critical for the recognition of immunostimulatory cpg motifs but may cooperate with other tlrs. we analyzed tlr1–10 mrna expression by using quantitative real-time pcr in highly purified subsets of human pbmc and determined the sensitivity of these subsets to cpg oligodeoxynucleotides (odn). tlr1 and tlr6 were expressed in all cell types examined. tlr10 was highly expressed in b cells and weakly expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pdc). high expression of tlr2 was characteristic for monocytes. pdc and b cells expressed marked levels of tlr7 and tlr9 and were directly sensitive to cpg odn. in cpg odn-stimulated pdc and b cells, tlr9 expression rapidly decreased, as opposed to tlr7, which was up-regulated in pdc and decreased in b cells. in monocytes, nk cells, and t cells, tlr7 was absent. despite low expression of tlr9, monocytes, nk cells, and t cells did not respond to cpg odn in the absence of pdc but were activated in the presence of pdc. in conclusion, our studies provide evidence that pdc and b cells, but not monocytes, nk cells, or t cells, are primary targets of cpg odn in peripheral blood. the characteristic expression pattern of tlr1–10 in cellular subsets of human pbmc is consistent with the concept that tlr9 is essential in the recognition of cpg odn in pdc and b cells. in addition, selective regulation of tlr7 expression in pdc and b cells by cpg odn revealed tlr7 as a candidate tlr potentially involved in modulating the recognition of cpg motifs.
infection avoidance behavior: viral exposure reduces the motivation to forage in female drosophila melanogaster interactions between immune systems, nervous systems, and behavior are well established in vertebrates. a comparative examination of these interactions in other animals will help us understand their evolution and present adaptive functions. insects show immune-behavioral interactions similar to those seen in vertebrates, suggesting that many of them may have a highly conserved function. activation of an immune response in insects results in illness-induced anorexia, behavioral fever, changes in reproductive behavior, and decreased learning ability in a broad range of species. flight-or-fight behaviors result in a decline in disease resistance. in insects, illness-induced anorexia may enhance immunity. stress-induced immunosuppression is probably due to physiological conflicts between the immune response and those of other physiological processes. because insects occupy a wide range of ecological niches, they will be useful in examining how some immune-behavioral interactions are sculpted by an animal's behavioral ecology.
the association between socioeconomic status and visual impairments among primary glaucoma: the results from nationwide korean national health insurance cohort from 2004 to 2013 purpose. to estimate the prevalence of glaucoma and costs associated with glaucoma care in south korea between 2008 and 2013 using the korean national claims database. design. retrospective cross-sectional study from a national claims database. methods. patients who were diagnosed with glaucoma between 2008 and 2013 were retrospectively identified in the national claims database using glaucoma diagnostic codes. for each year, the prevalence of glaucoma and direct medical costs associated with glaucoma care were estimated. result. the prevalence of glaucoma in patients ≥40 years of age increased from 0.79% in 2008 to 1.05% in 2013. the number of patients with glaucoma increased by 54% between 2008 and 2013 (9% average annual increase). the prevalence of glaucoma increased with age and was higher in males than in females. the cost to care for glaucoma patients increased from $16.5 million in 2008 to $29.2 million in 2013, which translated into an 81% increase over the 6 years examined (12.7% average annual increase). conclusion. the estimated prevalence and socioeconomic burden of glaucoma have steadily increased each year in south korea. nevertheless, many glaucoma patients remain undiagnosed in the present study using national claims database.
antibiotic-induced perturbations of the intestinal microbiota alter host susceptibility to enteric infection abstract transmission is an essential stage of a pathogen's life cycle and remains poorly understood. we describe here a model in which persistently infected 129x1/svj mice provide a natural model of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium transmission. in this model only a subset of the infected mice, termed supershedders, shed high levels (>108 cfu/g) of salmonella serovar typhimurium in their feces and, as a result, rapidly transmit infection. while most salmonella serovar typhimurium-infected mice show signs of intestinal inflammation, only supershedder mice develop colitis. development of the supershedder phenotype depends on the virulence determinants salmonella pathogenicity islands 1 and 2, and it is characterized by mucosal invasion and, importantly, high luminal abundance of salmonella serovar typhimurium within the colon. immunosuppression of infected mice does not induce the supershedder phenotype, demonstrating that the immune response is not the main determinant of salmonella serovar typhimurium levels within the colon. in contrast, treatment of mice with antibiotics that alter the health-associated indigenous intestinal microbiota rapidly induces the supershedder phenotype in infected mice and predisposes uninfected mice to the supershedder phenotype for several days. these results demonstrate that the intestinal microbiota plays a critical role in controlling salmonella serovar typhimurium infection, disease, and transmissibility. this novel model should facilitate the study of host, pathogen, and intestinal microbiota factors that contribute to infectious disease transmission.
comparison between supervised and unsupervised learning of probabilistic linear discriminant analysis mixture models for speaker verification many current face recognition algorithms perform badly when the lighting or pose of the probe and gallery images differ. in this paper we present a novel algorithm designed for these conditions. we describe face data as resulting from a generative model which incorporates both within-individual and between-individual variation. in recognition we calculate the likelihood that the differences between face images are entirely due to within-individual variability. we extend this to the non-linear case where an arbitrary face manifold can be described and noise is position-dependent. we also develop a "tied" version of the algorithm that allows explicit comparison across quite different viewing conditions. we demonstrate that our model produces state of the art results for (i) frontal face recognition (ii) face recognition under varying pose.
hypertonic sodium resuscitation after hemorrhage improves hemodynamic function by stimulating cardiac, but not renal, sympathetic nerve activity. in conscious mammals including humans, the neurohumoral and hemodynamic responses to progressive acute hypovolemia have two distinct phases. there is an initial arterial baroreceptor-mediated phase in which the fall in cardiac output is nearly matched by a sympathetically mediated increase in peripheral resistance so that arterial pressure is maintained near normal levels. in most species, adrenal catecholamines and vasopressin contribute little to this phase. increased renin release appears to augment the sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction. when blood volume has fallen by a critical amount (approximately 30%), a second phase develops abruptly. this phase is characterized by withdrawal of sympathetic vasoconstrictor drive, relative or absolute bradycardia, an increase in release of adrenal catecholamines and vasopressin, and a profound fall in arterial pressure. in rabbits and rats the signal that initiates this phase appears to travel in cardiopulmonary afferents. in dogs and humans its origin is unknown. central opioidergic and serotonergic mechanisms may be involved.
the influence of regional health system characteristics on the surgical management and receipt of post operative radiation therapy for glioblastoma multiforme purpose to evaluate trends in the geographic distribution of the radiation oncology (ro) workforce.   methods and materials we used the 1995 and 2007 versions of the area resource file to map the ratio of ro to the population aged 65 years or older (ror) within different health service areas (hsa) within the united states. we used regression analysis to find associations between population variables and 2007 ror. we calculated gini coefficients for ror to assess the evenness of ro distribution and compared that with primary care physicians and total physicians.   results there was a 24% increase in the ro workforce from 1995 to 2007. the overall growth in the ro workforce was less than that of primary care or the overall physician workforce. the mean ror among hsas increased by more than one radiation oncologist per 100,000 people aged 65 years or older, from 5.08 per 100,000 to 6.16 per 100,000. however, there remained consistent geographic variability concerning ro distribution, specifically affecting the non-metropolitan hsas. regression analysis found higher ror in hsas that possessed higher education (p = 0.001), higher income (p < 0.001), lower unemployment rates (p < 0.001), and higher minority population (p = 0.022). gini coefficients showed ro distribution less even than for both primary care physicians and total physicians (0.326 compared with 0.196 and 0.292, respectively).   conclusions despite a modest growth in the ro workforce, there exists persistent geographic maldistribution of radiation oncologists allocated along socioeconomic and racial lines. to solve problems surrounding the ro workforce, issues concerning both gross numbers and geographic distribution must be addressed.
the role of g protein coupled receptor kinases in neurocardiovascular pathophysiology in the mammalian heart, cardiac function is under the control of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. all regions of the mammalian heart are innervated by parasympathetic (vagal) nerves, although the supraventricular tissues are more densely innervated than the ventricles. vagal activation causes stimulation of cardiac muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (m-chr) that modulate pacemaker activity via i(f) and i(k.ach), atrioventricular conduction, and directly (in atrium) or indirectly (in ventricles) force of contraction. however, the functional response elicited by m-chr-activation depends on species, age, anatomic structure investigated, and m-chr-agonist concentration used. among the five m-chr-subtypes m(2)-chr is the predominant isoform present in the mammalian heart, while in the coronary circulation m(3)-chr have been identified. in addition, evidence for a possible existence of an additional, not m(2)-chr in the heart has been presented. m-chr are subject to regulation by g-protein-coupled-receptor kinase. alterations of cardiac m(2)-chr in age and various kinds of disease are discussed.
human intestinal fatty acid binding protein 2 expression is associated with fat intake and polymorphisms. the intestinal mucosa metabolizes fatty acids differently when presented to the lumenal or basolateral membrane. expression of both liver and intestinal fatty acid binding proteins (l- and i-fabps) uniquely in the enterocyte offers a possible explanation of this phenomenon. an organ explant system was used to analyze the relative binding of fatty acids to each protein. more fatty acid was bound to l-fabp than to i-fabps (28% vs. 6% of cytosolic radioactivity), no matter on which side the fatty acid was added. however, a 2-3-fold increase in fatty acid binding to the intestinal paralog was noted after apical addition of palmitic or oleic acid in mucosa from chow fed rats. when oleic acid was added apically, a 1.4-fold increase in binding to i-fabp was observed in mucosa derived from chronically fat fed rats, consistent with the previously observed 50% increase in the content of that protein. immunocytochemical localization of both fabps in vivo demonstrated an apical cytoplasmic localization in the fasting state, and redistribution to the entire cytoplasm after fat feeding. these data are consistent with the hypothesis that i-fabp may contribute to the metabolic compartmentalization of apically presented fatty acids in the intestine.
finite element modeling of short-wavelength folding on venus: implications for the plume hypothesis for crustal plateau formation crustal plateaus on venus constitute one of that planet’s most intriguing tectonic features. they host so-called “tessera” terrain, or deformed crust exhibiting two or more sets of intersecting tectonic lineaments, which comprises»8% of venus’ surface. major questions surrounding crustal plateaus and tessera terrain include: (1) what is the nature of crustal plateau deformation? what structures are present, and what are their spatial and temporal relations? (2) what is the global distribution of tessera terrain? does it form a global layer under the regional plains, cropping out in crustal plateaus, or is it confined to crustal plateaus? and (3) what are the implications of (1) and (2) for understanding the processes responsible for formation and deformation of crustal plateaus? structural and kinematic analyses reveal that deformation at ovda regio, venus largest crustal plateau, is characterized by linear shallow steep-sided troughs (ribbons), long arcuate long-wavelength folds, short mid-wavelength folds, and wide complex graben. temporal relations between structures lead to a three-phase regional strain history consisting of (1) layer-normal flattening of a thin competent membrane resulting in radially oriented, distributed extension (ribbon formation); (2) modest contraction of a thicker layer (concentric folding at plateau margins, interference folding in the plateau interior); and (3) limited extension localized at fold crests (graben formation). wavelength analysis of ribbons and folds places limits on the thickness of the competent layer during each stage of deformation and reflects an early shallow brittle‐ductile transition (bdt) that deepened with time. ovda’s deformation, topography, and gravity are all spatially correlated, strongly suggesting a genetic relationship between surface deformation and processes causing crustal thickening and plateau uplift. thus tessera terrain at ovda regio is likely confined to the topographically high plateau and does not extend beneath the surrounding regional plains. similar patterns persist at other crustal plateaus, indicating that tessera terrain is in general confined to crustal plateaus and does not form a globally continuous layer. ovda’s structures, their spatial and temporal relations, the resulting strain history, and the behavior of the bdt through time support a model of mantle plume upwelling in a thin lithospheric regime for crustal plateau formation and contradict previous downwelling models. similarities between structural and kinematic trends at ovda regio and other crustal plateaus lend support to this idea. c ∞ 1999 academic press
giant spontaneous depolarizing potentials in the developing thalamic reticular nucleus. in the brain, highly connected and heterogeneous gabaergic cells are crucial in controling the activity of neuronal networks. they accomplish this task by communicating through remarkably diverse sets of inhibitory processes, the complexity of which is reflected by the variety of interneuron classification schemes proposed in recent years. it is now becoming clear that the subcellular localization and intrinsic properties of heteropentameric gaba(a) receptors themselves also constitute major sources of diversity in gaba-mediated signaling. this review summarizes some of the factors underlying this diversity, including gaba(a) receptor subunit composition, localization, activation, number and phosphorylation states, variance of gaba concentration in the synaptic cleft, and some of the presynaptic factors regulating gaba release.
indomethacin pharmacodynamics are altered by surfactant: a possible challenge to current indomethacin dosing guidelines created before surfactant availability objective we conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial to determine whether higher doses of indomethacin would improve the rate of patent ductus arteriosus (pda) closure.   study design infants (<28 weeks gestation) who received a conventional, prophylactic 3-dose course of indomethacin were eligible if they had continued evidence of persistent ductus patency on an echocardiogram obtained before the third prophylactic indomethacin dose. infants (n = 105) were randomized to receive an extended 3-day course of either low-dose (0.1 mg/kg/d) or higher-dose (0.2 or 0.5 mg/kg/d) indomethacin. an echocardiogram was obtained 24 hours after the last dose of study drug.   results despite increasing serum indomethacin concentrations by 2.9-fold in the higher-dose group, we failed to detect a significant decrease in the rate of persistent pda (low = 52%; higher = 45%, p = .50). the higher-dose group had a significantly higher occurrence of serum creatinine >2 mg/100 ml (low = 6%, higher = 19%, p < .05) and moderate/severe retinopathy of prematurity (rop) (low = 15%, higher = 36%, p < .025). the incidence of moderate/severe rop was directly related to the poststudy indomethacin concentrations (odds ratio = 1.75, confidence interval: 1.15-2.68, p < .01).   conclusion increasing indomethacin concentrations above the levels achieved with a conventional dosing regimen had little effect on the rate of pda closure but was associated with higher rates of moderate/severe rop and renal compromise.
interactive exploration of large photo libraries next generation environments will change the way people work and live as they will provide new advances in areas ranging from remote work and education, e-commerce, gaming to information-on-demand. in many of these applications intelligent interpretation of multimedia data such as image, video and audio resources is necessary. in this paper we present an effective approach to handling image repositories providing the user with an intuitive interface of visualising and browsing large collections of pictures. based on the idea of similarity-based organisation of images where images that are visually similar are located close to each other in visualisation space, images are projected onto a sphere with which the user can interact. rotating the sphere reveals images of different colours while tilting operations focus on brighter or darker images. large image collections are handled through a hierarchical approach that brings up similar, previously hidden, images when zooming in on an area. furthermore, the way images are organised can be interactively changed by the user. our next generation browsing environment has been successfully tested on a large database of several thousand images.
antecedents of onshore and offshore business process outsourcing outsourcing, whether of it or business processes, onshore or offshore, continues to raise expectations and pose challenges for private and public sector organizations alike. time and again, we found even experienced organizations running into massive problems, suffering from slow organizational learning, and working in a reactive rather than an anticipatory mode. the results are troubling. here are some recent examples:

neuronal network analysis axons in the cerebral cortex receive synaptic input at the axon initial segment almost exclusively from γ-aminobutyric acid–releasing (gabaergic) axo-axonic cells (aacs). the axon has the lowest threshold for action potential generation in neurons; thus, aacs are considered to be strategically placed inhibitory neurons controlling neuronal output. however, we found that aacs can depolarize pyramidal cells and can initiate stereotyped series of synaptic events in rat and human cortical networks because of a depolarized reversal potential for axonal relative to perisomatic gabaergic inputs. excitation and signal propagation initiated by aacs is supported by the absence of the potassium chloride cotransporter 2 in the axon.
consensus of second-order discrete-time multi-agent systems with nonuniform time-delays and dynamically changing topologies in this paper, we discuss consensus problems for networks of dynamic agents with fixed and switching topologies. we analyze three cases: 1) directed networks with fixed topology; 2) directed networks with switching topology; and 3) undirected networks with communication time-delays and fixed topology. we introduce two consensus protocols for networks with and without time-delays and provide a convergence analysis in all three cases. we establish a direct connection between the algebraic connectivity (or fiedler eigenvalue) of the network and the performance (or negotiation speed) of a linear consensus protocol. this required the generalization of the notion of algebraic connectivity of undirected graphs to digraphs. it turns out that balanced digraphs play a key role in addressing average-consensus problems. we introduce disagreement functions for convergence analysis of consensus protocols. a disagreement function is a lyapunov function for the disagreement network dynamics. we proposed a simple disagreement function that is a common lyapunov function for the disagreement dynamics of a directed network with switching topology. a distinctive feature of this work is to address consensus problems for networks with directed information flow. we provide analytical tools that rely on algebraic graph theory, matrix theory, and control theory. simulations are provided that demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.
gnx-4728, a novel small molecule drug inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition, is therapeutic in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis alzheimer’s disease (ad), parkinson’s disease (pd) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) are the most common human adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases. they are characterized by prominent age-related neurodegeneration in selectively vulnerable neural systems. some forms of ad, pd, and als are inherited, and genes causing these diseases have been identified. nevertheless, the mechanisms of the neuronal cell death are unresolved. morphological, biochemical, genetic, as well as cell and animal model studies reveal that mitochondria could have roles in this neurodegeneration. the functions and properties of mitochondria might render subsets of selectively vulnerable neurons intrinsically susceptible to cellular aging and stress and overlying genetic variations, triggering neurodegeneration according to a cell death matrix theory. in ad, alterations in enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, oxidative damage, and mitochondrial binding of aβ and amyloid precursor protein have been reported. in pd, mutations in putative mitochondrial proteins have been identified and mitochondrial dna mutations have been found in neurons in the substantia nigra. in als, changes occur in mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes and mitochondrial cell death proteins. transgenic mouse models of human neurodegenerative disease are beginning to reveal possible principles governing the biology of selective neuronal vulnerability that implicate mitochondria and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. this review summarizes how mitochondrial pathobiology might contribute to neuronal death in ad, pd, and als and could serve as a target for drug therapy.
closed-form solutions for options in incomplete markets february , 2013 in this paper we study both market risks and nonmarket risks, without complete markets assumption, and discuss methods of measurement of these risks. we present and justify a set of four desirable properties for measures of risk, and call the measures satisfying these properties "coherent." we examine the measures of risk provided and the related actions required by span, by the sec/nasd rules, and by quantile-based methods. we demonstrate the universality of scenario-based methods for providing coherent measures. we offer suggestions concerning the sec method. we also suggest a method to repair the failure of subadditivity of quantile-based methods. copyright blackwell publishers inc 1999.
caveolin-1 is not essential for biosynthetic apical membrane transport trpc1, a component of store-operated ca2+ entry (soce) channels, is assembled in a complex with caveolin-1 (cav1) and key ca2+ signaling proteins. this study examines the role of cav1 in the function of trpc1. trpc1 and cav1 were colocalized in the plasma membrane region of human submandibular gland and madin-darby canine kidney cells. full-length cav1 bound to both the n and c termini of trpc1. amino acids 271–349, which includes a cav1 binding motif (amino acids 322–349), was identified as the cav1 binding domain in the trpc1 n terminus. deletion of amino acids 271–349 or 322–349 prevented plasma membrane localization of trpc1. importantly, trpc1δ271–349 induced a dominant suppression of soce and was associated with wild-type trpc1. although the role of the c-terminal cav1 binding domain is not known, its deletion did not affect localization of trpc1 (singh, b. b., liu, x., and ambudkar, i. s. (2000) j. biol. chem. 275, 36483–36486). further, expression of a truncated cav1 (cav1δ51-169), but not full-length cav1, similarly disrupted plasma membrane localization of endogenously and exogenously expressed trpc1 in human submandibular gland and madin-darby canine kidney cells. cav1δ51–169 also suppressed thapsigarginand carbachol-stimulated ca2+ influx and increased the detergent solubility of trpc1, although plasma membrane lipid raft domains were not disrupted. these data demonstrate that plasma membrane localization of trpc1 depends on an interaction between its n terminus and cav1. thus, our data suggest that cav1 has an important role in the assembly of soce channel(s).
brain organization mirrors caste differences, colony founding and nest architecture in paper wasps (hymenoptera: vespidae) the evolution of unusually large brains in some groups of animals, notably primates, has long been a puzzle. although early explanations tended to emphasize the brain's role in sensory or technical competence (foraging skills, innovations, and way-finding), the balance of evidence now clearly favors the suggestion that it was the computational demands of living in large, complex societies that selected for large brains. however, recent analyses suggest that it may have been the particular demands of the more intense forms of pairbonding that was the critical factor that triggered this evolutionary development. this may explain why primate sociality seems to be so different from that found in most other birds and mammals: primate sociality is based on bonded relationships of a kind that are found only in pairbonds in other taxa.
investigating factors influencing consumer willingness to buy gm food and nano-food nanotechnology is increasingly being employed in the areas of food production and packaging. public perception will be crucial to the realization of these technological advances. we examined how lay people (n=153) perceive nanotechnology foods and nanotechnology food packaging, and we examined the factors that influence willingness to buy these products. participants received some general information about nanotechnology, and specific information about four nanotechnology applications. overall, participants were hesitant to buy nanotechnology foods or food with nanotechnology packaging. results suggest, however, that nanotechnology packaging is perceived as being more beneficial than nanotechnology foods. results further suggest that social trust in the food industry is an important factor directly influencing the affect evoked by these new products. as suggested by the affect heuristic, affect had an impact on perceived benefits and perceived risks. perceived benefit seems to be the most important predictor for willingness to buy.
signal detection in amplitude‐modulated maskers. ii. processing in the songbird's auditory forebrain coding of amplitude modulated acoustic stimuli was studied within isofrequency planes of the tonotopically organized field l, the avian analogue of the mammalian auditory cortex. the synchronization of unit responses to envelopes of sinusoidally amplitude modulated tones (am) and repetitive noise bursts (rn) were determined as a function of envelope frequency (ef). from 249 synchronizing units, 66% were tuned to a best envelope frequency (bef) using a synchronization criterion. befs varied from 0.3 to 380 hz and showed an orderly representation within isofrequency planes orthogonal to the lamination of field l. the majority (68%) of these units had befs below 20 hz down to 0.3 hz. thus, they were tuned to rhythms typical for animal communication sounds, speech, and music. thirty-two % had befs between 20 hz and 380 hz and covered at least 4 of 5 octaves of the range of periodicity pitch sensation.
sodium phenylbutyrate and edaravone abrogate chronic restraint stress-induced behavioral deficits: implication of oxido-nitrosative, endoplasmic reticulum stress cascade, and neuroinflammation stress and the resulting increase in glucocorticoid levels have been implicated in the pathophysiology of depressive disorders. we investigated the effects of chronic restraint stress (crs: 6 hours × 28 days) on anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in rats and on the possible changes in glucocorticoid receptor (gr) expression as well as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf)-dependent neural function in the prefrontal cortex (pfc). we observed significant reductions in body weight gain, food intake and sucrose preference from 1 week after the onset of crs. in the 5th week of crs, we conducted open-field (oft), elevated plus-maze (epm) and forced swim tests (fst). we observed a decrease in the number of entries into open arms during the epm (anxiety-like behavior) and increased immobility during the fst (depression-like behavior). when the pfc was removed after crs and subject to western blot analysis, the gr expression reduced compared with control, while the levels of bdnf and its receptors remained unchanged. basal glutamate concentrations in pfc acute slice which were measured by high performance liquid chromatography were not influenced by crs. however, bdnf-induced glutamate release was attenuated after crs. these results suggest that reduced gr expression and altered bdnf function may be involved in chronic stress-induced anxiety--and depression-like behaviors.
women-specific hiv/aids services: identifying and defining the components of holistic service delivery for women living with hiv/aids specialized substance abuse treatment programs have been developed for women within the past two decades. this article presents the results of a secondary analysis of a regional database of drug abuse treatment programs that compared the characteristics of women-only (wo) and mixed-gender (mg) programs across three treatment modalities. in general, wo programs differed from mg programs in their policies regarding fees, sources of payment, special populations served, services offered, and treatment capacity, process, and duration. the differences in program characteristics reflect broader societal gender differences, including women's generally lower economic status and primary responsibility for child-rearing.
nevus comedonicus: a case series abstract: we report extensive nevus comedonicus in a female patient that involved half of her body entirely, with infected cystic lesions as well as typical scars, limited by the midline. the lesions worsened at the beginning of puberty. a brief review of the literature highlights the histopathologic, etiopathogenic, and therapeutic aspects.
clinicalarticle authors bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia some macrolides have been found to exert anti-inflammatory effects. lung diseases such as asthma, panbronchiolitis, cystic fibrosis, and bronchiectasis are thought to respond to the immunomodulatory properties of macrolides. we report three cases of idiopathic bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, now called cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, and three cases of radiation-related bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia that responded to macrolide therapy. an explanation of why macrolides may have anti-inflammatory effects in patients with these syndromes is discussed. these cases help to reinforce accumulating data that macrolides are beneficial as anti-inflammatory agents and organizing pneumonia may be another pulmonary disease that can benefit from such therapy.
the role of nuclear receptor nhr-64 in fat storage regulation in caenorhabditis elegans the nuclear receptor superfamily is comprised of over 150 different proteins that have evolved to mediate a complex array of extracellular signals into transcriptional responses. many, but not all, of these proteins directly bind to signaling molecules, which, because of their small lipophilic character, can easily enter the target cell. thus, unlike membrane-bound receptors, the nuclear receptors are intracellular and function to control the activity of target genes directly. in aggregate, these target genes comprise a genetic network whose coordinate activity defines the physiologic response. the purpose of this review is to establish the historical links between the steroid and nonsteroid receptor signaling systems, to chart the explosive development of the retinoid x receptor (rxr) heterodimer and orphan receptor family, to explain the impact of these discoveries on our understanding of the mechanisms of hormonal signaling, and, finally, to present emerging issues and implications of these studies for animal development, physiology, and human disease.
protein tyrosine nitration in hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy taurine, a major osmolyte in the brain evokes a long-lasting enhancement (lletau) of synaptic transmission in hippocampal and cortico-striatal slices. hippocampal lletau was abolished by the gaba uptake blocker nipecotic acid (npa) but not by the taurine-uptake inhibitor guanidinoethyl sulphonate (ges). striatal lletau was sensitive to ges but not to npa. semiquantitative pcr analysis and immunohistochemistry revealed that taurine transporter expression is significantly higher in the striatum than in the hippocampus. taurine transporter-deficient mice displayed very low taurine levels in both structures and a low ability to develop lletau in the striatum, but not in the hippocampus. the different mechanisms of taurine-induced synaptic plasticity may reflect the different vulnerabilities of these brain regions under pathological conditions that are accompanied by osmotic changes such as hepatic encephalopathy.
hypocapnia-induced contraction of porcine airway smooth muscle. the effects of changes in airway co2 partial pressure (paco2) and arterial co2 partial pressure (paco2) on lung mechanics were studied in dogs by utilizing unilateral pulmonary artery occlusion and a tracheal divider which allowed separate variation of paco2 and paco2. when paco2 was held at a reasonably normal level, lower than normal paco2 levels resulted in large compliance decreases, alteration of the complete static pressure-volume curves, and increases in resistance. invreases in paco2 to hypercapnic levels did not produce changes. when paco2 was held at a reasonably normal level, changes in paco2 levels were positively and directly related to resistance with small and inconsistent effects on compliance and on complete static pressure-volume curves. a combination of low paco2 and high paco2 produced large increases in resistance, alterations of the static pressure-volume curve, and decreases in compliance. vagotomy during the combined stimulus resulted in only a decrease in resistance without change in lung elastic properties. the results suggest that the mechanical effects of airway hypocapnia and systemic hypercapnia are additive. however, small airways effects of low paco2 appear to be maximal and uninfluenced by the vagally mediated response to paco2 increases.
a polyconvex framework for soft biological tissues. adjustment to experimental data abstract this paper presents a rate-independent elastoplastic constitutive model for (nearly) incompressible biological fiber-reinforced composite materials. the constitutive framework, based on multisurface plasticity, is suitable for describing the mechanical behavior of biological fiber-reinforced composites in finite elastic and plastic strain domains. a key point of the constitutive model is the use of slip systems, which determine the strongly anisotropic elastic and plastic behavior of biological fiber-reinforced composites. the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into elastic and plastic parts allows the introduction of an anisotropic helmholtz free-energy function for determining the anisotropic response. we use the unconditionally stable backward-euler method to integrate the flow rule and employ the commonly used elastic predictor/plastic corrector concept to update the plastic variables. this choice is expressed as an eulerian vector update the newton's type, which leads to a numerically stable and efficient material model. by means of a representative numerical simulations the performance of the proposed constitutive framework is investigated in detail.
inhibition of semliki forest virus penetration by lysosomotropic weak bases. semliki forest virus was mixed with liposomes containing phosphatidylcholine,phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin, and cholesterol. when the ph of the mixture was dropped to 6 or below, rapid fusion between the membranes of the virus and the liposomes occurred, resulting in the transfer of viral nucleocapsids into the liposomes. fusion was demonstrated biochemically by trapping rnase or trypsin within the liposomes. trapped rnase digested the viral rna into acid-soluble form, providing a simple quantitative assay for fusion. trapped trypsin digested the viral capsid protein. fusion was also demonstrated by electron microscopy as the formation of large vesicles containing viral glycoproteins on the surface and nucleocapsids inside. the efficiency of fusion was 91 +/- 6%. in addition to low ph, it required that the viral glycoproteins be intact. in the target liposomes, cholesterol (but none of the individual phospholipids) was essential. divalent cations were not required. our previous studies with tissue culture cells indicated that the final step in the penetration of the semliki forest virus genome into host cells might involve a fusion event between the membrane of lysosomally trapped viruses and the lysosomal membrane [helenius, a., kartenbeck, j., simons, k. & fries, e. (1980) j. cell biol, 84, 404--420]. the data presented here are fully compatible with this hypothesis.
medical documentation, bioanalytical evidence of an accidental human exposure to sulfur mustard and general therapy recommendations. the persistence in rats of sulfur mustard adducts to albumin and hemoglobin was studied in vivo after exposure (intravenously; 0.3 mg/kg; approximately 0.1 ld(50)) of rats to sulfur mustard. the albumin adduct (s-hete)cys-pro-tyr was detectable up to 7 days after the exposure, while the adduct to the n-terminal valine in hemoglobin was still detected after 28 days. the decrease in adduct levels corresponded well with the half-life time of albumin in rats and with the lifetime of the rat erythrocyte. remarkably, the n-terminal valine adduct to hemoglobin increased during the first three days, which implies that there is still free sulfur mustard present during that time. in contrast, the corresponding albumin adduct levels did not increase during this time period. the free sulfur mustard might have accumulated in the erythrocyte cell membrane.
multiplanar osteotomy with limited wide margins: a tissue preserving surgical technique for high-grade bone sarcomas background the purpose of this study was to analyze a series of patients with a high-grade metaphyseal osteosarcoma of the knee who had been treated with a transepiphyseal resection, with preservation of the distal femoral and the proximal tibial (articular) portions of the epiphysis, and an intercalary allograft reconstruction.   methods the cases of thirteen patients with a high-grade metaphyseal osteosarcoma around the knee who had transepiphyseal resection and reconstruction with an intercalary allograft were retrospectively reviewed at a mean of sixty-three months. complications, disease-free survival of the patient, final preservation of the limb and epiphysis, and functional results according to the musculoskeletal tumor society scoring system were documented at the time of the latest follow-up.   results at the final follow-up examination, eleven of the thirteen patients continued to be disease-free. one patient died of bone and pulmonary metastases with no evidence of local recurrence, and the remaining patient had no evidence of disease after resection of a local recurrence of the tumor in the soft tissues. no patient had a local recurrence in the remaining epiphysis. seven patients had complications that included a fracture (three patients), diaphyseal nonunion (two), deep infection (one), and a local recurrence in the soft tissues (one). the allograft was removed in only four of these patients. at the latest follow-up examination, twelve patients were alive with preserved limbs. in one patient, the epiphysis, which originally had been preserved, was resected because of a metaphyseal fracture, and the limb was reconstructed with an osteoarticular allograft. the patients with a preserved epiphysis had an average functional score of 27 points (maximum, 30 points).   conclusions preservation of the epiphysis in high-grade metaphyseal osteosarcoma at the knee is an alternative in carefully selected patients. crucial factors needed to obtain local tumor control and achieve an acceptable functional result are a positive response to chemotherapy, accurate preoperative assessment of tumor extension to the epiphysis, and appropriate fixation techniques for intercalary allografts.   level of evidence therapeutic study, level iv (case series [no, or historical, control group]). see instructions to authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.
quantitative analysis on ex vivo nonlinear microscopy images of basal cell carcinoma samples in comparison to healthy skin dermoscopy is an in vivo method for the early diagnosis of malignant melanoma and the differential diagnosis of pigmented lesions of the skin. it has been shown to increase diagnostic accuracy over clinical visual inspection in the hands of experienced physicians. this article is a review of the principles of dermoscopy as well as recent technological developments.
from nf1 to sdhb knockout: successes and failures in the quest for animal models of pheochromocytoma although the alteration of cellular metabolism in cancer was reported by warburg in the early 1930s, a regain of interest in cancer metabolism has more recently followed the discovery of germline or somatic mutations in genes coding for metabolic enzymes (succinate dehydrogenase, fumarate hydratase and isocitrate dehydrogenase) that are associated with tumor susceptibility. mutations in these genes are found in numerous tumor types including paragangliomas, kidney cancers, leiomyomas, glioblastomas and acute myeloid leukemia. they lead to the accumulation of so‐called oncometabolites that behave as competitors of 2‐oxoglutarate‐dependent dioxygenases, involved in a broad spectrum of pathways such as hypoxic response and epigenetic reprogramming. here, we review the diverse pathways affected by oncometabolites, their potential role in cancer formation, maintenance, metastasis and sensitivity to chemotherapies, as well as emerging new therapeutic strategies.
metabolic alterations in the anterior cingulate cortex and related cognitive deficits in late adolescent methamphetamine users adolescence is a period of heightened vulnerability both to addictive behaviors and drug-induced brain damage. yet, only limited information exists on the brain mechanisms underlying these adolescent-specific characteristics. moreover, distinctions in brain correlates between predisposition to drug use and effects of drugs in adolescents are unclear. using cortical thickness and diffusion tensor image analyses, we found greater and more widespread gray and white matter alterations, particularly affecting the frontostriatal system, in adolescent methamphetamine (ma) users compared with adult users. among adolescent-specific gray matter alterations related to ma use, smaller cortical thickness in the orbitofrontal cortex was associated with family history of drug use. our findings highlight that the adolescent brain, which undergoes active myelination and maturation, is more vulnerable to ma-related alterations than the adult brain. furthermore, ma-use-related executive dysfunction was greater in adolescent ma users than in adult users. these findings may provide explanation for the severe behavioral complications and relapses that are common in adolescent-onset drug addiction. additionally, these results may provide insights into distinguishing the neural mechanisms that underlie the predisposition to drug addiction from effects of drugs in adolescents.
recent treatment history vs clinical characteristics in the prediction of use of outpatient psychiatric services this article specifies and estimates a model of provider choice for mental health services. three types of providers are identified: specialty mental health providers, general medical providers, and informal providers. specific attention is paid to the role of health and mental health status in determining provider choice. the model is estimated using a multinomial logit approach applied to a sample of 2,800 respondents to the baltimore epidemiological catchment area survey. the results are largely consistent with the previous work of wells et al. (1982), suggesting that health and mental health status play an important role in the decision to seek care but have little effect on the type of provider chosen. the results also reveal that 22 percent of individuals obtaining mental health care did so through the informal care sector. one exemplary benefit design simulation is performed using the estimation results.
variance-sensitive choice in lemurs: constancy trumps quantity the last decade's lemur research includes successes in discovering new living and extinct species and learning about the distribution, biogeography, physiology, behavior, and ecology of previously little-studied species. in addition, in both the dry forest and rain forest, long-term studies of lemur demography, life history, and reproduction, have been completed in conjunction with data on tree productivity, phenology, and climate. lemurs contrast with anthropoids in several behavioral features, including female dominance, targeted female-female aggression, lack of sexual dimorphism regardless of mating system, sperm competition coupled with male-male aggression, high infant mortality, cathemerality, and strict seasonal breeding. hypotheses to explain these traits include the "energy conservation hypothesis" (ech) suggesting that harsh and unpredictable climate factors on the island of madagascar have affected the evolution of female dominance, and the "evolutionary disequilibrium hypotheses" (evdh) suggesting that the recent megafauna extinctions have influenced lemurs to become diurnal. these hypotheses are compared and contrasted in light of recent empirical data on climate, subfossils, and lemur behavior. new data on life histories of the rain forest lemurs at ranomafana national park give further support to the ech. birth seasons are synchronized within each species, but there is a 6-month distribution of births among species. gestation and lactation lengths vary among sympatric lemurs, but all lemur species in the rain forest wean in synchrony at the season most likely to have abundant resources. across-species weaning synchrony seen in ranomafana corroborates data from the dry forest that late lactation and weaning is the life history event that is the primary focus of the annual schedule. lemur adaptations may assure maximum offspring survival in this environment with an unpredictable food supply and heavy predation. in conclusion, a more comprehensive energy frugality hypothesis (efh) is proposed, which postulates that the majority of lemur traits are either adaptations to conserve energy (e.g., low basal metabolic rate (bmr), torpor, sperm competition, small group size, seasonal breeding) or to maximize use of scarce resources (e.g., cathemerality, territoriality, female dominance, fibrous diet, weaning synchrony). among primates, the isolated adaptive radiation of lemurs on madagascar may have been uniquely characterized by selection toward efficiency to cope with the harsh and unpredictable island environment.
multivalent scfv display of phagemid repertoires for the selection of carbohydrate-specific antibodies and its application to the thomsen-friedenreich antigen. conventional antisera used as a positive control in antibody tests during hybridoma screening and processing can be replaced to advantage by supernatants of short term spleen cell cultures. such cultures can easily be initiated from the same spleen cell suspension which is prepared in connection with a fusion experiment. either supernatants of corresponding cultures from nonimmune animals or medium alone can serve as a negative control. in vitro produced polyclonal standards show very low background binding compared to antisera raised in vivo. they are convenient "ready-to-use" reagents with an antibody titer comparable to that expected in hybridoma culture fluids. there is no need for immunization and bleeding of separate animals. in addition, these supernatants provide an internal control of the immunization efficiency.
an fpga implementation architecture for decoding of polar codes the two central topics of information theory are the compression and the transmission of data. shannon, in his seminal work, formalized both these problems and determined their fundamental limits. since then the main goal of coding theory has been to find practical schemes that approach these limits. polar codes, recently invented by arikan, are the first "practical" codes that are known to achieve the capacity for a large class of channels. their code construction is based on a phenomenon called "channel polarization". the encoding as well as the decoding operation of polar codes can be implemented with o(n log n) complexity, where n is the blocklength of the code. we show that polar codes are suitable not only for channel coding but also achieve optimal performance for several other important problems in information theory. the first problem we consider is lossy source compression. we construct polar codes that asymptotically approach shannon's rate-distortion bound for a large class of sources. we achieve this performance by designing polar codes according to the "test channel", which naturally appears in shannon's formulation of the rate-distortion function. the encoding operation combines the successive cancellation algorithm of arikan with a crucial new ingredient called "randomized rounding". as for channel coding, both the encoding as well as the decoding operation can be implemented with o(n log n) complexity. this is the first known "practical" scheme that approaches the optimal rate-distortion trade-off. we also construct polar codes that achieve the optimal performance for the wyner-ziv and the gelfand-pinsker problems. both these problems can be tackled using "nested" codes and polar codes are naturally suited for this purpose. we further show that polar codes achieve the capacity of asymmetric channels, multi-terminal scenarios like multiple access channels, and degraded broadcast channels. for each of these problems, our constructions are the first known "practical" schemes that approach the optimal performance. the original polar codes of arikan achieve a block error probability decaying exponentially in the square root of the block length. for source coding, the gap between the achieved distortion and the limiting distortion also vanishes exponentially in the square root of the blocklength. we explore other polar-like code constructions with better rates of decay. with this generalization, we show that close to exponential decays can be obtained for both channel and source coding. the new constructions mimic the recursive construction of arikan and, hence, they inherit the same encoding and decoding complexity. we also propose algorithms based on message-passing to improve the finite length performance of polar codes. in the final two chapters of this thesis we address two important problems in graphical models related to communications. the first problem is in the area of low-density parity-check codes (ldpc). for practical lengths, ldpc codes using message-passing decoding are still the codes to beat. the current analysis, using density evolution, evaluates the performance of these algorithms on a tree. the tree assumption corresponds to using an infinite length code. but in practice, the codes are of finite length. we analyze the message-passing algorithms for this scenario. the absence of tree assumption introduces correlations between various messages. we show that despite this correlation, the prediction of the tree analysis is accurate. the second problem we consider is related to code division multiple access (cdma) communication using random spreading. the current analysis mainly focuses on the information theoretic limits, i.e., using gaussian input distribution. however in practice we use modulation schemes like binary phase-shift keying (bpsk), which is far from being gaussian. the effects of the modulation scheme cannot be analyzed using traditional tools which are based on spectrum of large random matrices. we follow a new approach using tools developed for random spin systems in statistical mechanics. we prove a tight upper bound on the capacity of the system when the user input is bpsk. we also show that the capacity depends only on the power of the spreading sequences and is independent of their exact distribution.
serum epidermal growth factor receptor and her2 expression in primary and metastatic breast cancer patients over-expression of members of the erbb-receptor family has been associated with malignant transformation. the amplification of her-2/neu in tumor tissue is now an established prognostic factor in breast cancer. in order to initiate signal transduction, erbb-receptor monomers need to form homo- or heterodimers. the composition of these dimers is thought to influence both quality and quantity of downstream signaling pathways, and to determine the biological response. we have investigated the protein expression pattern of the four erbb-receptors egfr, her-2/neu, her-3 and her-4, and correlated it with their putative ligands egf, tgf-α and hrg in 74 women with invasive breast cancer. using western blot-analysis on cell membrane isolates, we detected the co-expression of all four erbb-family members in 79.7% of cases, and of all of the three investigated ligands in 82.4%. we did not observe a correlation between egfr and her-2/neu or her-4 protein expression, egfr and her-3 (p = 0.005), and her-3 and her-4 (p = 0.05) were clearly co-expressed. the strongest overall correlation, was found between her-2/neu and her-3 (p < 0.001) and between her-2/neu and her-4 (p = 0.001). this was particularly true in nodal-positive tumors (p <0.001 and p = 0.002) whereas in nodal-negative tumors the co-expression was either less significant (her-2/neu and her-3; p = 0.01) or not significant (her-2/neu and her-4). the co-expression of egfr/her-3 was associated with the expression of all ligands, whereas the her-2/neu/her-3 was correlated with hrg (p = 0.002), thereby indicating a functional relation between specific receptor-dimer combinations and putative ligands. taken together, we have performed the first comprehensive survey of erbb-system expression in breast cancer, and have demonstrated the presence of a co-regulated receptor/ligand system in vivo. we have further shown that her-2/neu is the preferred co-expression partner in nodal-positive tumors and thus the most likely dimerization candidate in malignant breast tumors.
ad4bp/sf-1 regulates cholesterol synthesis to boost the production of steroids sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (srebps) are key transcriptional regulators of lipid metabolism. to define functional differences between the three mammalian srebps we used genome-wide chip-seq with isoform-specific antibodies and chromatin from select tissues of mice challenged with different dietary conditions that enrich for specific srebps. we show that hepatic srebp-2 binds preferentially to two different gene-proximal motifs. a gene ontology (go) analysis suggests srebp-2 targets lipid metabolic processes as expected, but apoptosis and autophagy gene categories were also enriched. we show that srebp-2 directly activates autophagy genes during cell-sterol depletion, conditions known to induce both autophagy and nuclear srebp-2 levels. additionally, srebp-2 knockdown during nutrient depletion decreased autophagosome formation and lipid droplet association of the autophagosome targeting protein lc3. thus, the lipid droplet could be viewed as a third source of cellular cholesterol, which along with sterol synthesis and uptake, is also regulated by srebp-2.
optimal survival time-related cut-point with censored data. in biomedical research and practice, quantitative tests or biomarkers are often used for diagnostic or screening purposes, with a cut point established on the quantitative measurement to aid binary classification. this paper introduces an alternative to the traditional methods based on the youden index and the closest-to-(0, 1) criterion for threshold selection. a concordance probability evaluating the classification accuracy of a dichotomized measure is defined as an objective function of the possible cut point. a nonparametric approach is used to search for the optimal cut point maximizing the objective function. the procedure is shown to perform well in a simulation study. using data from a real-world study of arsenic-induced skin lesions, we apply the method to a measure of blood arsenic levels, selecting a cut point to be used as a warning threshold.
scalable directory architecture for distributed shared memory chip multiprocessors recent technology improvements allow multiprocessor designers to put some key components inside the processor chip, such as the memory controller, the coherence hardware, and the network interface/router. in this paper, we exploit such integration scale, presenting a novel node architecture aimed at reducing the long l2 miss latencies and the memory overhead of using directories that characterize cc-numa machines and limit their scalability. our proposal replaces the traditional directory with a novel three-level directory architecture, as well as it adds a small shared data cache to each of the nodes of a multiprocessor system. due to their small size, the first-level directory and the shared data cache are integrated into the processor chip in every node, which enhances performance by saving accesses to the slower main memory. scalability is guaranteed by having the second and third-level directories out of the processor chip and using compressed data structures. a taxonomy of the l2 misses, according to the actions performed by the directory to satisfy them, is also presented. using execution-driven simulations, we show that significant latency reductions can be obtained by using the proposed node architecture, which translates into reductions of more than 30 percent in several cases in the application execution time.
alcohol consumption and risky sexual behavior among persons attending alcohol consumption venues in gaborone, botswana we tested 2 competing theories about the effects of alcohol on intentions to engage in risky behavior. disinhibition predicts that intoxicated people will exhibit risky behavior regardless of environmental cues, whereas alcohol myopia (c. m. steele & r. a. josephs, 1990) predicts that intoxicated people will be more or less likely to exhibit risky behavior, depending on the cues provided. in 4 studies, we found an interaction between intoxication and cue type. when impelling cues were present, intoxicated people reported greater intentions to have unprotected sex than did sober people. when subtle inhibiting cues were present, intoxicated and sober people reported equally cautious intentions (studies 1-3). when strong inhibiting cues were present, intoxicated people reported more prudent intentions than did sober people (study 4). we suggest that alcohol myopia provides a more comprehensive account of the effects of alcohol than does disinhibition.

in vivo rna interference screens identify regulators of antiviral cd4(+) and cd8(+) t cell differentiation. t follicular helper cell differentiation when b cells respond to an infection, they often require help from cd4+ t cells to mount a proper response. it is thought that a subset of cd4+ effector t cells, called t follicular helper cells (tfh), performs this function. several subsets of effector cd4+ t cells arise, depending on the type of infection, which have distinct transcriptional programs driving their differentiation. whether this is also the case for tfh cells has not been clear (see the perspective by awasthi and kuchroo). nurieva et al. (p. 1001, published online 23 july) and johnston et al. (p. 1006; published online 16 july) now demonstrate that the transcription factor bcl6 is both necessary and sufficient for tfh differentiation and subsequent b cell–mediated immunity, suggesting that it is a master regulator of this lineage. johnston et al. also show that expression of bcl6 and the transcription factor, blimp-1, are reciprocally regulated in tfh cells and that, when ectopically expressed, blimp-1 inhibits tfh development. the transcription factors that regulate follicular t helper cell differentiation are identified. effective b cell–mediated immunity and antibody responses often require help from cd4+ t cells. it is thought that a distinct cd4+ effector t cell subset, called t follicular helper cells (tfh), provides this help; however, the molecular requirements for tfh differentiation are unknown. we found that expression of the transcription factor bcl6 in cd4+ t cells is both necessary and sufficient for in vivo tfh differentiation and t cell help to b cells in mice. in contrast, the transcription factor blimp-1, an antagonist of bcl6, inhibits tfh differentiation and help, thereby preventing b cell germinal center and antibody responses. these findings demonstrate that tfh cells are required for proper b cell responses in vivo and that bcl6 and blimp-1 play central but opposing roles in tfh differentiation.
effect of eradication of helicobacter pylori in rheumatoid arthritis patients apart from the complication of gastrointestinal vasculitis it is not known whether the upper gastrointestinal (ugi) tract has any special disease characteristics in rheumatoid arthritis (ra). however, oesophageal motility disorders have been reported in 30% of ra patients. hypergastrinaemia has been found in 23-43% of ra patients, usually in combination with a decreased gastric acid output. another finding suggestive of a decreased secretory state, namely a decreased level of pepsinogen a, was found in ra patients with the sicca syndrome and in patients with active disease. the risk for peptic ulcer disease with regard to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaid) is possibly higher in ra patients than in patients with other rheumatic diseases. these findings suggest that in ra patients intrinsic factors play a role in the pathogenesis of the oesophageal motility disorders, in hypergastrinaemia and hypopepsinogenaemia and the related decreased gastric secretory state, and possibly in the increased susceptibility to nsaid-related ulcers. however, there are also indications that oesophageal motility disorders, hypergastrinaemia, and nsaid-related ulcers in ra are the result of extrinsic factors, mainly the use of nsaids. the effects of nsaids and gold compounds on infection with helicobacter pylori, a possible pathogenetic factor in ulcer disease, is discussed. it is clear that the discussion about intrinsic and extrinsic factors as a cause of the ugi manifestations in ra remains an intriguing but difficult subject for further studies.
accelerated free breathing ecg triggered contrast enhanced pulmonary vein magnetic resonance angiography using compressed sensing purpose to design a segmented inversion-recovery turbo fast low-angle shot (turboflash) magnetic resonance (mr) imaging pulse sequence for the visualization of myocardial infarction, compare this technique with other mr imaging approaches in a canine model of ischemic injury, and evaluate its utility in patients with coronary artery disease.   materials and methods six dogs and 18 patients were examined. in dogs, infarction was produced and images were acquired by using 10 different pulse sequences. in patients, the segmented turboflash technique was used to acquire contrast material-enhanced images 19 days +/- 7 (sd) after myocardial infarction.   results myocardial regions of increased signal intensity were observed in all animals and patients at imaging. with the postcontrast segmented turboflash sequence, the signal intensity of the infarcted myocardium was 1,080% +/- 214 higher than that of the normal myocardium in dogs-nearly twice that of the next best sequence tested and approximately 10-fold greater than that in previous reports. all 18 patients with myocardial infarction demonstrated high signal intensity at imaging. on average, the signal intensity of the high-signal-intensity regions in patients was 485% +/- 43 higher than that of the normal myocardium.   conclusion the segmented inversion-recovery turboflash sequence produced the greatest differences in regional myocardial signal intensity in animals. application of this technique in patients with infarction substantially improved differentiation between injured and normal regions.
west nile virus ecology in a tropical ecosystem in guatemala. objectives west nile virus (flavivirus: flaviviridae; wnv) has spread rapidly throughout the caribbean basin since its initial detection there in 2001. this report summarizes our current knowledge of wnv transmission in tropical america.   methods we reviewed the published literature and consulted with key public health officials to obtain unpublished data.   results west nile virus infections first appeared in human residents of the cayman islands and the florida keys in 2001, and in apparently healthy jamaican birds sampled early in 2002. serologic evidence of wnv infection in 2002 was detected in horses, chickens and resident free-ranging birds in guadeloupe, the dominican republic, and eastern mexico. in 2003, wnv spread in mexico and northern central america, and serologic evidence was detected in the bahamas, puerto rico and cuba. in 2004, the first serologic evidence of wnv activity in south american ecosystems surfaced in september-october in colombia and trinidad, where domestic animals circulated wnv-neutralizing antibodies.   conclusions the sparse reports of equine, human and avian disease in latin america and the caribbean is puzzling. isolates are needed to evaluate viral attenuation or other possible explanations for reduced disease burden in tropical ecosystems.
sodium phenylbutyrate and edaravone abrogate chronic restraint stress-induced behavioral deficits: implication of oxido-nitrosative, endoplasmic reticulum stress cascade, and neuroinflammation stress and the resulting increase in glucocorticoid levels have been implicated in the pathophysiology of depressive disorders. we investigated the effects of chronic restraint stress (crs: 6 hours × 28 days) on anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in rats and on the possible changes in glucocorticoid receptor (gr) expression as well as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf)-dependent neural function in the prefrontal cortex (pfc). we observed significant reductions in body weight gain, food intake and sucrose preference from 1 week after the onset of crs. in the 5th week of crs, we conducted open-field (oft), elevated plus-maze (epm) and forced swim tests (fst). we observed a decrease in the number of entries into open arms during the epm (anxiety-like behavior) and increased immobility during the fst (depression-like behavior). when the pfc was removed after crs and subject to western blot analysis, the gr expression reduced compared with control, while the levels of bdnf and its receptors remained unchanged. basal glutamate concentrations in pfc acute slice which were measured by high performance liquid chromatography were not influenced by crs. however, bdnf-induced glutamate release was attenuated after crs. these results suggest that reduced gr expression and altered bdnf function may be involved in chronic stress-induced anxiety--and depression-like behaviors.
interaction of silicene with amino acid analogues—from physical to chemical adsorption in gas and solvated phases because of its unique physical properties, graphene, a 2d honeycomb arrangement of carbon atoms, has attracted tremendous attention. silicene, the graphene equivalent for silicon, could follow this trend, opening new perspectives for applications, especially due to its compatibility with si-based electronics. silicene has been theoretically predicted as a buckled honeycomb arrangement of si atoms and having an electronic dispersion resembling that of relativistic dirac fermions. here we provide compelling evidence, from both structural and electronic properties, for the synthesis of epitaxial silicene sheets on a silver (111) substrate, through the combination of scanning tunneling microscopy and angular-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in conjunction with calculations based on density functional theory.
a role for dicer in immune regulation the mirbase database aims to provide integrated interfaces to comprehensive microrna sequence data, annotation and predicted gene targets. mirbase takes over functionality from the microrna registry and fulfils three main roles: the mirbase registry acts as an independent arbiter of microrna gene nomenclature, assigning names prior to publication of novel mirna sequences. mirbase sequences is the primary online repository for mirna sequence data and annotation. mirbase targets is a comprehensive new database of predicted mirna target genes. mirbase is available at .
nitric oxide radicals choreograph a radioadaptive response. adaptive survival responses (asrs) are observed when cells become more resistant to a high dose of a cytotoxic agent after repeated low dose exposures to that agent or another genotoxic agent. confluent (g0/g1) human normal (gm2936b, gm2937a, ag2603, imr-90), cancer-prone (xpv2359), and neoplastic (u1-mel, hep-2, htb-152) cells were primed with repeated low doses of x-rays (ranging from 0.05-10 cgy/day for 4 days), then challenged with a high dose (290-450 cgy) on day 5. u1-mel and hep-2 cells showed greater than 2-fold transient survival enhancement when primed with 1-10 cgy. asrs in u1-mel or hep-2 cells were blocked by cycloheximide or actinomycin d. increases in cyclins a and d1 mrnas were noted in primed compared to unirradiated u1-mel and hep-2 cells; however, only cyclin a protein levels increased. cyclin d1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna) protein levels were constitutively elevated in hep-2 and u1-mel cells, compared to the other human normal and neoplastic cells examined, and were not altered by low or high doses of radiation. low dose primed u1-mel cells entered s-phase 4-6 h faster than unprimed u1-mel cells upon low-density replating. similar responses in terms of survival recovery, transcript and protein induction, and altered cell cycle regulation were not observed in the other human normal, cancer-prone or neoplastic cells examined. we hypothesize that only certain human cells can adapt to ionizing radiation by progressing to a point later in g1 (the a point) where dna repair processes and radioresistance can be induced. asrs in human cells correlated well with constitutively elevated levels of pcna and cyclin d1, as well as inducibility of cyclin a. we propose that a protein complex composed of cyclin d1, pcna, and possibly cyclin a may play a role in cell cycle regulation and dna repair, which determine asrs in human cells.
implementation, validation and profiling of a genetic algorithm for molecular conformational optimization computer simulations of simple exact lattice models are an aid in the study of protein folding process; they have sometimes resulted in predictions experimentally proved. the contact interactions (ci) method is here proposed as a new algorithm for the conformational search in the low‐energy regions of protein chains modeled as copolymers of hydrophobic and polar monomers configured as self‐avoiding walks on square or cubic lattices. it may be regarded as an extension of the standard monte carlo method improved by the concept of cooperativity deriving from nonlocal contact interactions. a major difference with respect to other algorithms is that criteria for the acceptance of new conformations generated during the simulations are not based on the energy of the entire molecule, but cooling factors associated with each residue define regions of the model protein with higher or lower mobility. nine sequences of length ranging from 20 to 64 residues were used on the square lattice and 15 sequences of length ranging from 46 to 136 residues were used on the cubic lattice. the ci algorithm proved very efficient both in two and three dimensions, and allowed us to localize energy minima not localized by other searching algorithms described in the literature. use of this algorithm is not limited to the conformational search, because it allows the exploration of thermodynamic and kinetic behavior of model protein chains.
cox-2/mpges-1/pge2 cascade activation mediates uric acid-induced mesangial cell proliferation hyperuricemia is associated with renal disease, but it is usually considered a marker of renal dysfunction rather than a risk factor for progression. recent studies have reported that mild hyperuricemia in normal rats induced by the uricase inhibitor, oxonic acid (oa), results in hypertension, intrarenal vascular disease, and renal injury. this led to the hypothesis that uric acid may contribute to progressive renal disease. to examine the effect of hyperuricemia on renal disease progression, rats were fed 2% oa for 6 wk after 5/6 remnant kidney (rk) surgery with or without the xanthine oxidase inhibitor, allopurinol, or the uricosuric agent, benziodarone. renal function and histologic studies were performed at 6 wk. given observations that uric acid induces vascular disease, the effect of uric acid on vascular smooth muscle cells in culture was also examined. rk rats developed transient hyperuricemia (2.7 mg/dl at week 2), but then levels returned to baseline by week 6 (1.4 mg/dl). in contrast, rk+oa rats developed higher and more persistent hyperuricemia (6 wk, 3.2 mg/dl). hyperuricemic rats demonstrated higher bp, greater proteinuria, and higher serum creatinine than rk rats. hyperuricemic rk rats had more renal hypertrophy and greater glomerulosclerosis (24.2 +/- 2.5 versus 17.5 +/- 3.4%; p < 0.05) and interstitial fibrosis (1.89 +/- 0.45 versus 1.52 +/- 0.47; p < 0.05). hyperuricemic rats developed vascular disease consisting of thickening of the preglomerular arteries with smooth muscle cell proliferation; these changes were significantly more severe than a historical rk group with similar bp. allopurinol significantly reduced uric acid levels and blocked the renal functional and histologic changes. benziodarone reduced uric acid levels less effectively and only partially improved bp and renal function, with minimal effect on the vascular changes. to better understand the mechanism for the vascular disease, the expression of cox-2 and renin were examined. hyperuricemic rats showed increased renal renin and cox-2 expression, the latter especially in preglomerular arterial vessels. in in vitro studies, cultured vascular smooth muscle cells incubated with uric acid also generated cox-2 with time-dependent proliferation, which was prevented by either a cox-2 or txa-2 receptor inhibitor. hyperuricemia accelerates renal progression in the rk model via a mechanism linked to high systemic bp and cox-2-mediated, thromboxane-induced vascular disease. these studies provide direct evidence that uric acid may be a true mediator of renal disease and progression.
monetary policy delegation and equilibrium coordination why is it that inflation is persistently high in some periods and persistently low in other periods? we argue that lack of commitment in monetary policy may bear a large part of the blame. we show that, in a standard equilibrium model, absence of commitment leads to multiple equilibria, or expectation traps. in these traps, expectations of high or low inflation lead the public to take defensive actions which then make it optimal for the monetary authority to validate those expectations. we find support in cross-country evidence for key implications of the model.
bioremediation strategies for removal of residual atrazine in the boreal groundwater zone the following study evaluated the diversity and biogeography of 83 new atrazine-degrading bacteria and the composition of their atrazine degradation genes. these strains were isolated from 13 agricultural soils and grouped according to rep-pcr genomic fingerprinting into 11 major clusters, which showed biogeographic patterns. three clusters (54 strains) belonged to the genus arthrobacter, seven clusters (28 strains) were similar to the genus nocardioides and only one strain was a gram-negative from the genus ancylobacter. pcr assays for the detection of the genes atza, b, c, d, e, f and trzn conducted with each of the 83 strains revealed that 82 strains (all gram positive) possessed trzn, 74 of them possessed the combination of trzn, atzb and atzc, while only the gram-negative strain had atza. a similar pcr assay for the two analogous genes, atza and trzn, responsible for the first step of atrazine degradation, was performed with dna extracted directly from the enrichment cultures and microcosms spiked with atrazine. in these assays, the gene trzn was detected in each culture, while atza was detected in only six out of 13 soils. these results raise an interesting hypothesis on the evolutionary ecology of the two atrazine chlorohydrolase genes (i.e. atza and trzn) and about the biogeography of atrazine-degrading bacteria.
femtosecond laser capsulotomy to correct a severe refractive error and obviate thick spectacles or contact lenses, an intraocular lens can be placed in the anterior chamber in front of the normal crystalline lens as an alternative to keratorefractive procedures. the power of the intraocular lens may be determined from the recipient's spectacle correction, its vertex distance, and the corneal power in diopters. these measurements, combined with an intraocular lens constant based on its location within the anterior chamber, provide the appropriate power of the intraocular lens. these formulas were applied to seven baikoff anterior chamber lenses and three momose anterior chamber lenses in phakic eyes. the mean absolute prediction error was 0.42 (standard deviation, +/- 0.60) for the baikoff lenses and 0.57 (+/- 0.64) for the momose lenses. the accuracy of the measurements is limited by the accuracy of the preoperative refraction, the measurement of the corneal power, and the restoration of the preoperative refractive power of the cornea.
two variants in the resistin gene and the response to long-term overfeeding resistin is a newly identified hormone secreted by adipocytes that inhibits insulin action on peripheral tissues. the aim of our study was to investigate whether genetic variability at this locus is associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes. by sequencing 32 subjects with type 2 diabetes, we identified 8 single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in the 5'-flanking region and introns of the resistin gene. allele and genotype distributions were determined for all 8 snps in 312 cases with type 2 diabetes and 303 nondiabetic controls, all of caucasian origin. no significant association with type 2 diabetes was found at any of the polymorphic loci. however, an interactive effect of genotype at snp 6 (ivs2 + 181g-->a) and obesity was a significant determinant of type 2 diabetes risk in this population. the relative risk of diabetes for the a/a genotype was 4.8 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-21.0) in individuals above the median for body weight, but only 0.7 (95% confidence interval, 0.2-2.1) in those below the median. this difference between relative risks was significant (chi(2) = 4.5; p = 0.03). a similar, but much weaker, interaction with obesity was observed for snps in linkage disequilibrium with snp6. in conclusion, resistin does not appear to be a major gene for type 2 diabetes. however, our data suggest a synergistic effect of sequence differences at the resistin locus and obesity on risk of type 2 diabetes. further studies are needed to confirm this finding in other populations.
alternative interventions to prevent oxidative damage following ischemia/reperfusion oxidative stress is considered a major contributor to etiology of both “normal” senescence and severe pathologies with serious public health implications. mitochondria generate reactive oxygen species (ros) that are thought to augment intracellular oxidative stress. mitochondria possess at least nine known sites that are capable of generating superoxide anion, a progenitor ros. mitochondria also possess numerous ros defense systems that are much less studied. studies of the last three decades shed light on many important mechanistic details of mitochondrial ros production, but the bigger picture remains obscure. this review summarizes the current knowledge about major components involved in mitochondrial ros metabolism and factors that regulate ros generation and removal. an integrative, systemic approach is applied to analysis of mitochondrial ros metabolism, which is now dissected into mitochondrial ros production, mitochondrial ros removal, and mitochondrial ros emission. it is suggested that mitochondria augment intracellular oxidative stress due primarily to failure of their ros removal systems, whereas the role of mitochondrial ros emission is yet to be determined and a net increase in mitochondrial ros production in situ remains to be demonstrated.
economic inequality is related to cross-national prevalence of psychotic symptoms greater income inequality is associated with higher prevalence of mental illness and drug misuse in rich societies. there are threefold differences in the proportion of the population suffering from mental illness between more and less equal countries. this relationship is most likely mediated by the impact of inequality on the quality of social relationships and the scale of status differentiation in different societies.
development of dipicolylamine-modified cyclodextrins for the design of selective guest-responsive receptors for atp in this feature article, we focus on recent advances in our research on molecular recognition and fluorescence sensing of phosphate anion derivatives of biological importance. because of their significant roles in biological systems, considerable efforts have been devoted to developing detection or determination systems. however, the recognition and sensing of these anion species under aqueous biological conditions using small-molecular chemosensors still remain as a challenging research topic. we have been developing a variety of artificial receptors and fluorescent chemosensors for phosphoproteins and nucleoside polyphosphates in recent years. they consist of a binuclear zn(ii)-dipicolylamine (dpa) complex as a common binding motif for phosphate anion derivatives. taking advantage of their strong binding affinities or high sensing abilities, a variety of biological assay systems have also been successfully developed, which includes the enzyme assays such as the kinase, phosphatase and glycosyltransferase reaction, as well as an inhibitor assay for the phosphoprotein-protein surface interaction.

interleukin-1 gene polymorphisms and toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis purpose to begin a process of standardizing the methods for reporting clinical data in the field of uveitis.   design consensus workshop.   methods members of an international working group were surveyed about diagnostic terminology, inflammation grading schema, and outcome measures, and the results used to develop a series of proposals to better standardize the use of these entities. small groups employed nominal group techniques to achieve consensus on several of these issues.   results the group affirmed that an anatomic classification of uveitis should be used as a framework for subsequent work on diagnostic criteria for specific uveitic syndromes, and that the classification of uveitis entities should be on the basis of the location of the inflammation and not on the presence of structural complications. issues regarding the use of the terms "intermediate uveitis," "pars planitis," "panuveitis," and descriptors of the onset and course of the uveitis were addressed. the following were adopted: standardized grading schema for anterior chamber cells, anterior chamber flare, and for vitreous haze; standardized methods of recording structural complications of uveitis; standardized definitions of outcomes, including "inactive" inflammation, "improvement'; and "worsening" of the inflammation, and "corticosteroid sparing," and standardized guidelines for reporting visual acuity outcomes.   conclusions a process of standardizing the approach to reporting clinical data in uveitis research has begun, and several terms have been standardized.
inter-relationship among economic growth, savings and inflation in pakistan this paper re-examines the issue of the existence of threshold effects in the relationship between inflation and growth, using new econometric techniques that provide appropriate procedures for estimation and inference. the threshold level of inflation above which inflation significantly slows growth is estimated at 1-3 percent for industrial countries and 11-12 percent for developing countries. the negative and significant relationship between inflation and growth, for inflation rates above the threshold level, is quite robust with respect to the estimation method, perturbations in the location of the threshold level, the exclusion of high-inflation observations, data frequency, and alternative specifications.
brain organization of the recognition of fragmented images in subjects who show different levels of task performance success this paper reports perceptual identification thresholds for 150 pictures from the 1980 snodgrass and vanderwart picture set. these pictures were fragmented and presented on the apple macintosh microcomputer in a picture-fragment completion task in which identification thresholds were obtained at three phases of learning: train (initial presentation), new (initial presentation after training on a different set), and old (repeated presentation of the train set). pictures were divided into five sets of two subsets of 15 pictures each, which served alternately as the train and new sets. a total of 100 subjects participated in the task, with 10 subjects assigned to each subset. individual thresholds for each picture at each phase of learning are presented, along with the fragmented pictures identified by 35% of the subjects across the train and new learning phases. this set of fragmented pictures is provided for use in experiments in which a single level of fragmented image is presented for identification after a priming phase. correlations between the snodgrass and vanderwart norms and identification thresholds at the three phases of learning are also reported.
kicking out the trolls - antecedents of social exclusion intentions in facebook groups we investigated how intentions to hide and unfriend facebook contacts were linked to perceived sender attractiveness and face-threating messages (ftas). intention to hide was higher than intention to unfriend contacts, implying that unfriending is harsher. low social attractiveness predicted hiding and unfriending intentions, but low physical attractiveness was only linked to hiding. disrespectful messages were linked to hiding contacts, while updates that made the receiver look bad were linked to unfriending. ftas also mediated the influence of social and physical attractiveness on hiding and unfriending contacts. overall, managing online relationships relied on independent and interdependent perceptual and behavioral processes.
multiplex genetic fate mapping reveals a novel route of neocortical neurogenesis, which is altered in the ts65dn mouse model of down syndrome neurons in the developing rodent cortex are generated from radial glial cells that function as neural stem cells. these epithelial cells line the cerebral ventricles and generate intermediate progenitor cells that migrate into the subventricular zone (svz) and proliferate to increase neuronal number. the developing human svz has a massively expanded outer region (osvz) thought to contribute to cortical size and complexity. however, osvz progenitor cell types and their contribution to neurogenesis are not well understood. here we show that large numbers of radial glia-like cells and intermediate progenitor cells populate the human osvz. we find that osvz radial glia-like cells have a long basal process but, surprisingly, are non-epithelial as they lack contact with the ventricular surface. using real-time imaging and clonal analysis, we demonstrate that these cells can undergo proliferative divisions and self-renewing asymmetric divisions to generate neuronal progenitor cells that can proliferate further. we also show that inhibition of notch signalling in osvz progenitor cells induces their neuronal differentiation. the establishment of non-ventricular radial glia-like cells may have been a critical evolutionary advance underlying increased cortical size and complexity in the human brain.
method of evolving junctions: a new approach to optimal path-planning in 2d environments with moving obstacles planning algorithms are impacting technical disciplines and industries around the world, including robotics, computer-aided design, manufacturing, computer graphics, aerospace applications, drug design, and protein folding. this coherent and comprehensive book unifies material from several sources, including robotics, control theory, artificial intelligence, and algorithms. the treatment is centered on robot motion planning but integrates material on planning in discrete spaces. a major part of the book is devoted to planning under uncertainty, including decision theory, markov decision processes, and information spaces, which are the “configuration spaces” of all sensor-based planning problems. the last part of the book delves into planning under differential constraints that arise when automating the motions of virtually any mechanical system. developed from courses taught by the author, the book is intended for students, engineers, and researchers in robotics, artificial intelligence, and control theory as well as computer graphics, algorithms, and computational biology.
de novo cloning and annotation of genes associated with immunity, detoxification and energy metabolism from the fat body of the oriental fruit fly, bactrocera dorsalis tsetse flies (diptera: glossinidia) are vectors of pathogenic african trypanosomes. to develop a foundation for tsetse physiology, a normalized expressed sequence tag (est) library was constructed from fat body tissue of immune‐stimulated glossina morsitans morsitans. analysis of 20 257 high‐quality ests yielded 6372 unique genes comprised of 3059 tentative consensus (tc) sequences and 3313 singletons (available at http://aksoylab.yale.edu). we analysed the putative fat body transcriptome based on homology to other gene products with known functions available in the public domain. in particular, we describe the immune‐related products, reproductive function related yolk proteins and milk‐gland protein, iron metabolism regulating ferritins and transferrin, and tsetse's major energy source proline biosynthesis. expression analysis of the three yolk proteins indicates that all are detected in females, while only the yolk protein with similarity to lipases, is expressed in males. milk gland protein, apparently important for larval nutrition, however, is primarily synthesized by accessory milk gland tissue.
release of ethylbenzene and styrene from plastic cheese containers packaging has become an indispensible element in the food manufacturing process, and different types of additives, such as antioxidants, stabilizers, lubricants, anti-static and anti-blocking agents, have also been developed to improve the performance of polymeric packaging materials. recently the packaging has been found to represent a source of contamination itself through the migration of substances from the packaging into food. various analytical methods have been developed to analyze the migrants in the foodstuff, and migration evaluation procedures based on theoretical prediction of migration from plastic food contact material were also introduced recently. in this paper, the regulatory control, analytical methodology, factors affecting the migration and migration evaluation are reviewed.
abo blood group phenotypes influence parity specific immunity to plasmodium falciparum malaria in malawian women the mechanisms by which the hemoglobin genotype as protect against severe malaria are not fully understood. we have investigated the possibility that protection might be achieved through an inability of red blood cells (rbc) with the as genotype to form rosettes with rbc infected by plasmodium falciparum. no evidence was obtained to support this hypothesis because rbc with the as genotype formed rosettes with wild isolates of p. falciparum as readily as rbc with the aa genotype. however, the previous finding that parasitized rbc form rosettes more readily with rbc belonging to group a or b than with rbc belonging to group o was confirmed even in fresh clinical isolates.
the effect of prolonged physical activity performed during extreme caloric deprivation on cardiac function summarysixteen male subjects [18–21 years, maximal oxygen consumption  $$(\dot v_{o_{_2 } } )$$  = 59.2 ml · kg−1 min−1 ± sem 5.6] participated in a study to evaluate the effect of prolonged, complete food deprivation combined with physical effort, on plasma lipoprotein concentrations. the subjects were deprived of food for 81 h but were supplied with water: they walked for 10 h a day at 40% of  $$\dot v_{o_2 }$$ , covering a total of 105 km. during this period the subjects' average mass decreased significantly (p < 0.05) reflecting a marked catabolic process. plasma concentration of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol ([ldl-c]) and triglycerides were significantly lower (p < 0.05) and total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ([hdl-c]), and free fatty acid levels were significantly higher (p < 0.05) at the end of the experimental period compared to the start. the ratio between plasma [hdl-c] to plasma [ldl-c] increased from 0.51 to 0.89 at the end of the exercise period, reflecting a marked anti-aherogenic effect. all changes were transient and reversable within 12 days of recovery.
the ascorbic acid transporter svct2 is expressed in slow-twitch skeletal muscle fibres reactive oxygen species (ros) and redox state have emerged as physiological mediators, controlling blood coagulation and thrombosis. the redox balance is obviously linked to the presence of antioxidants; in particular, vitamin c appears to be a key modulator of platelet oxidative state, since these cells physiologically accumulate ascorbic acid and, moreover, platelet ascorbate plays a role during aggregation. here, we showed that platelets could compensate for fluctuations in ascorbate levels by modulating the expression of the na+-dependent transporter svct2. furthermore, the use of anucleated cells demonstrated, for the first time, that svct2 expression could be regulated at the translational level. the control of ascorbic acid uptake, through regulation of its carrier, was not only related to substrate availability, but it also occurred during platelet activation, which was accompanied by vitamin c deprivation and alteration in the redox state. finally, we showed that changes in intracellular ascorbic acid content had physiological relevance, since they modulate the surface sulfhydryl content and the thrombus viscoelastic properties. beside its role during aggregation, vitamin c may also have important effects during postaggregatory events.
using svm for classification in datasets with ambiguous data a method is proposed which computes a direction in a dataset such that a speci ed fraction of a particular class of all examples is separated from the overall mean by a maximal margin. the projector onto that direction can be used for class-speci c feature extraction. the algorithm is carried out in a feature space associated with a support vector kernel function, hence it can be used to construct a large class of nonlinear feature extractors. in the particular case where there exists only one class, the method can be thought of as a robust form of principal component analysis, where instead of variance we maximize percentile thresholds. finally, we generalize it to also include the possibility of specifying negative examples.
task-dependent intermuscular motor unit synchronization between medial and lateral vastii muscles during dynamic and isometric squats electromyograms (emgs) are measured by bipolar surface electrodes that quantify potential differences. bipolar potentials over penniform muscles may be associated with errors. our assumption was that muscle activity can be quantified more reliably and with a higher spatial resolution using current measurements. the purpose of this work is: (a) to introduce the concept of current measurements to detect muscle activity, (b) to show the coherences observed over a segment of a typical penniform muscle, the gastrocnemius medialis where one would expect a synchronicity of the activation, and (c) to show the amount of mixing that is caused by the finite inter electrode resistance. a current amplifier was developed. emgs were recorded at 40% of maximum voluntary contraction during isometric contractions of the gastrocnemius medialis. emgs of twelve persons were recorded with an array of four peripheral and one central electrode. monopolar emgs were recorded for "all-potential", "center at current" and "all-current" conditions. coherence revealed the similarity of signals recorded from neighboring electrodes. coherence was high for the "all-potential", significant for the "current at center" condition and disappeared in the "all-current" condition. it was concluded that emg array recordings strongly depends on the measurement configuration. the proposed current amplifier significantly improves spatial resolution of emg array recordings because the inter-electrode cross talk is reduced.
specialization of binaural responses in ventral auditory cortices the acoustical cues for sound location are generated by spatial- and frequency-dependent filtering of propagating sound waves by the head and external ears. although rats have been a common model system for anatomy, physiology, and psychophysics of localization, there have been few studies of the acoustical cues available to rats. here, directional transfer functions (dtfs), the directional components of the head-related transfer functions, were measured in six adult rats. the cues to location were computed from the dtfs. in the frontal hemisphere, spectral notches were present for frequencies from approximately 16 to 30 khz; in general, the frequency corresponding to the notch increased with increases in source elevation and in azimuth toward the ipsilateral ear. the maximum high-frequency envelope-based interaural time differences (itds) were 130 mus, whereas low-frequency (<3.5 khz) fine-structure itds were 160 mus; both types of itds were larger than predicted from spherical head models. interaural level differences (ilds) strongly depended on location and frequency. maximum ilds were <10 db for frequencies <8 khz and were as large as 20-40 db for frequencies >20 khz. removal of the pinna eliminated the spectral notches, reduced the acoustic gain and ilds, altered the acoustical axis, and reduced the itds.
unusual configurations of personality traits indicate multiple patterns of their coalescence it is argued that if we compute self-other agreement on some personality traits then we possess no or very little information about the individuals who are the targets of this judgment. this idea is largely based on two separate ways of computing self-other agreement: trait agreement (rt) and profile agreement (rp), which are typically associated with two different trait-centered and person-centered approaches in personality research. personality traits of 4115 targets from czech, belgian, estonian, and german samples were rated by themselves and knowledgeable informants. we demonstrate that trait agreement can be partialled into individual contributions so that it is possible to show how much each individual pair of judges contributes to agreement on a particular trait. similarly, it is possible to decompose agreement between two personality profiles into the individual contributions of traits from which these profiles are assembled. if normativeness is separated from distinctiveness of personality scores and individual profiles are ipsatized, then mean profile agreement rp becomes identical to mean trait agreement rt. the views that trait-by-trait analysis does not provide information regarding accuracy level of a particular pair of judges and profile analysis does not permit assessment of the relative contributions of traits to overall accuracy are not supported.
phylogeographical patterns shed light on evolutionary process in south america the making of amazonian diversity the biodiversity of the amazon basin is legendary, but the processes by which it has been generated have been debated. in the late 20th century the prevalent view was that the engine of diversity was repeated contraction and expansion of forest refugia during the past 3 million years or so. hoorn et al. (p. 927) analyze findings from a diverse range of disciplines, including molecular phylogeny, ecology, sedimentology, structural geology, and palaeontology, to offer an overview of the entire history of this region during the cenozoic era (66 million years ago). the uplift of the andes was a pivotal event in the evolution of amazonian landscapes because it continually altered river drainage patterns, which in turn put a variety of pressures on organisms to adapt to changing conditions in a multiplicity of ways. hence, the diversity of the modern biota of the amazon has more ancient origins than previously thought. the amazonian rainforest is arguably the most species-rich terrestrial ecosystem in the world, yet the timing of the origin and evolutionary causes of this diversity are a matter of debate. we review the geologic and phylogenetic evidence from amazonia and compare it with uplift records from the andes. this uplift and its effect on regional climate fundamentally changed the amazonian landscape by reconfiguring drainage patterns and creating a vast influx of sediments into the basin. on this “andean” substrate, a region-wide edaphic mosaic developed that became extremely rich in species, particularly in western amazonia. we show that andean uplift was crucial for the evolution of amazonian landscapes and ecosystems, and that current biodiversity patterns are rooted deep in the pre-quaternary.
ion channel clustering enhances weak electric field detection by neutrophils: apparent roles of skf96365-sensitive cation channels and myeloperoxidase trafficking in cellular responses application of extremely low frequency pulsed dc electric fields that are frequency- and phase-matched with endogenous metabolic oscillations leads to greatly exaggerated neutrophil extension and metabolic resonance wherein oscillatory nad(p)h amplitudes are increased. in the presence of a resonant field, migrating cell length grows from 10 to approximately 40 microm, as does the overall length of microfilament assemblies. in contrast, cells stop locomotion and become spherical when exposed to phase-mismatched fields. although cellular effects were not found to be dependent on electrode type and buffer, they were sensitive to temporal constraints (phase and pulse length) and cell surface charge. we suggest an electromechanical coupling hypothesis wherein applied electric fields and cytoskeletal polymerization forces act together to overcome the surface/cortical tension of neutrophils, thus promoting net cytoskeletal assembly and heightened metabolic amplitudes. metabolic resonance enhances reactive oxygen metabolic production by neutrophils. furthermore, cellular dna damage was observed after prolonged metabolic resonance using both single cell gel electrophoresis ('comet' assay) and 3'-oh dna labeling using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. these results provide insights into transmembrane signal processing and cell interactions with weak electric fields.
role of pseudoexons and pseudointrons in human cancer eukaryotic gene expression is orchestrated on a genome-wide scale through several post-transcriptional mechanisms. of these, alternative pre-mrna splicing expands the proteome diversity and modulates mrna stability through downstream rna quality control (qc) pathways including nonsense-mediated decay (nmd) of mrnas containing premature termination codons and nuclear retention and elimination (nre) of intron-containing transcripts. although originally identified as mechanisms for eliminating aberrant transcripts, a growing body of evidence suggests that nmd and nre coupled with deliberate changes in pre-mrna splicing patterns are also used in a number of biological contexts for deterministic control of gene expression. here we review recent studies elucidating molecular mechanisms and biological significance of these gene regulation strategies with a specific focus on their roles in nervous system development and physiology. this article is part of a special issue entitled 'rna and splicing regulation in neurodegeneration'.
clinicalarticle authors bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia some macrolides have been found to exert anti-inflammatory effects. lung diseases such as asthma, panbronchiolitis, cystic fibrosis, and bronchiectasis are thought to respond to the immunomodulatory properties of macrolides. we report three cases of idiopathic bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, now called cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, and three cases of radiation-related bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia that responded to macrolide therapy. an explanation of why macrolides may have anti-inflammatory effects in patients with these syndromes is discussed. these cases help to reinforce accumulating data that macrolides are beneficial as anti-inflammatory agents and organizing pneumonia may be another pulmonary disease that can benefit from such therapy.
a blood-csf barrier function controls embryonic csf protein composition and homeostasis during early cns development. embryonic cerebrospinal fluid (e-csf) is involved in the regulation of survival, proliferation and neurogenesis of neuroectodermal progenitor cells, as well as in the control of mesencephalic gene expression in collaboration with the isthmic organizer. recently, we showed the presence of retinol-binding protein (rbp) within the e-csf proteome. rbp is an all-trans retinol carrier, a molecule that can be metabolized into retinoic acid, a morphogen involved in central nervous system (cns) morphogenesis and patterning. here we demonstrate the presence of all-trans retinol within the e-csf and analyse the dynamics of rbp and all-trans retinol within this fluid, as well as the expression of retinoic acid-synthesizing enzymes during early cns development. our results suggest a relationship between the dynamics of these molecules and the early events of cns patterning.
rna polymerase elongation factors. the universal bacterial transcription elongation factor nusa mediates elongation activities of rna polymerase. by itself, nusa induces transcription pausing and facilitates intrinsic termination, but nusa also is a cofactor of antiterminators that antagonize pausing and prevent termination. we show that nusa is required for lambda-related phage 82 antiterminator q(82) to construct a stable complex in which rna-based termination mechanisms have restricted access to the emerging transcript; this result suggests a locale for both q(82) and nusa near the beta flap domain of rna polymerase. furthermore, as nusa is not required for the antipausing activity of q(82) in vitro, we distinguish two distinct activities of antiterminators, namely antipausing and rna occlusion, and discuss their roles in q(82) function.
n-meander scanning trace a method for the on-chip bandwidth reduction this work presents a domain-specific memory subsystem based on a two-level memory hierarchy. it targets the application domain of video post-processing applications including video enhancement and format conversion. these applications are based on motion compensation and/or broad class of content adaptive filtering to provide the highest quality of pictures. our approach meets the required performance and has sufficient flexibility for the application domain. it especially aims at the implementation-wise most challenging applications: compute-intensive and bandwidth-demanding applications that provide the highest quality at high picture resolutions. the lowest level of the memory hierarchy, closest to the processing element, the l0 scratchpad, is organized specifically to enable fast retrieval of an arbitrarily positioned 2-d block of pixels to the processing element. to guarantee the performance, most of its addressing logic is hardwired, leaving a user a set of api for initialization and storing/loading the data to/from the l0 scratchpad. the next level of the memory hierarchy, the l1 scratchpad, minimizes the off-chip memory bandwidth requirements. the l1 scratchpad is organized specifically to enable efficient aligned block-based accesses. with lower data rates compared to the l0 scratchpad and aligned block access, software-based addressing is used to enable full flexibility. the two-level memory hierarchy exploits prefetching to further improve the performance.
testing different nonsmooth formulations of the lennard–jones potential in atomic clustering problems this paper summarizes the current state of knowledge concerning putative global minima of the potential energy function for lennard-jones clusters, an intensely studied molecular conformation problem. almost all known exceptions to global optimality of the well-known northby multilayer icosahedral conformations for microclusters are shown to be minor variants of that geometry. the truly exceptional case of face-centered cubic lattice conformations is examined and connections are made with the macrocluster problem. several types of algorithms and their limitations are explored, and a new variation on the growth sequence idea is presented and shown to be effective for both small and large clusters.
geographical and ethnic distribution of the hbv c/d recombinant on the qinghai-tibet plateau abstract hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection is widely distributed in both human and ape populations throughout the world and is a major cause of human morbidity and mortality. hbv variants are currently classified into the human genotypes a to h and species-associated chimpanzee and gibbon/orangutan groups. to examine the role of recombination in the evolution of hbv, large-scale data retrieval and automated phylogenetic analysis (treeorder scanning) were carried out on all available published complete genome sequences of hbv. we detected a total of 24 phylogenetically independent potential recombinants (different genotype combinations or distinct breakpoints), eight of which were previously undescribed. instances of intergenotype recombination were observed in all human and ape hbv variants, including evidence for a novel gibbon/genotype c recombinant among hbv variants from vietnam. by recording sequence positions in trees generated from sequential fragments across the genome, violations of phylogeny between trees also provided evidence for frequent intragenotype recombination between members of genotypes a, d, f/h, and gibbon variants but not in b, c, or the asian b/c recombinant group. in many cases, favored positions for both inter- and intragenotype recombination matched positions of phylogenetic reorganization between the human and ape genotypes, such as the end of the surface gene and the core gene, where sequence relationships between genotypes changed in the treeorder scan. these findings provide evidence for the occurrence of past, extensive recombination events in the evolutionary history of the currently classified genotypes of hbv and potentially in changes in its global epidemiology and associations with human disease.
angiopoietin-2 impairs collateral artery growth associated with the suppression of the infiltration of macrophages in mouse hindlimb ischaemia objective—recently, we have shown that shear stress regulates the angiogenic potential of endothelial cells in vitro by an angiopoietin-2 (ang2)–dependent mechanism; however its pathophysiological significance in vivo was not clear. we hypothesized that ang2 plays an important role in blood flow recovery after arterial occlusion in vivo by regulating angiogenesis and arteriogenesis. methods and results—c57bl/6j mice underwent femoral artery ligation and were injected with a specific ang2 inhibitor, l1-10, or vehicle for 10 days. ang2 mrna was upregulated at day 2, and ang2 protein was upregulated at day 2, 5, and 7 in the ligated hindlimb. l1-10 treatment significantly blunted blood flow recovery. l1-10 decreased smooth muscle cell coverage of neovessels without affecting capillary density, suggesting a specific role for ang2 in arteriogenesis. mechanistically, l1-10 decreased expression of intercellular and vascular cell adhesion molecules as well as infiltrating monocytes/macrophages in the ischemic tissue. although l1-10 had no effect on the number of cd11b+ cells (monocytes/macrophages) mobilized in the bone marrow, it maintained elevated numbers of circulating cd11b+ cells in the peripheral blood. conclusions—these results suggest that ang2 induced in ischemic tissue plays a critical role in blood flow recovery by stimulating inflammation and arteriogenesis.
interactive comment on “ observation of slant column no 2 using the super-zoom mode of aura-omi ” we present a new algorithm for the near-real time retrieval ? within 3 h of the actual satellite measurement ? of tropospheric no2 columns from the ozone monitoring instrument (omi). the retrieval system is based on the combined retrieval-assimilation-modelling approach developed at knmi for off-line tropospheric no2 from the gome and sciamachy satellite instruments. we have adapted the off-line system such that the required a priori information ndash; profile shapes and stratospheric background no2 ndash; is now immediately available upon arrival of the omi no2 slant columns and cloud data at knmi. slant column no2 and cloud information arrives at knmi typically within 80 min of actual omi observations. slant columns for no2 are retrieved using differential optical absorption spectroscopy (doas) in the 405?465 nm range. cloud fraction and cloud pressure are provided by a new cloud retrieval algorithm that uses the absorption of the o2?o2 collision complex near 477 nm. on-line availability of stratospheric slant columns and no2 profiles is achieved by running the tm4 chemistry transport model (ctm) forward in time based on forecast ecmwf meteo and assimilated no2 information from all previously observed orbits. omi no2 slant columns, after correction for spurious across-track variability, show a random error for individual pixels of approximately 0.7×1015molec.cm?2. as no2 retrievals are very sensitive to clouds, we evaluated the consistency of cloud fraction and cloud pressure from the new o2?o2 (omi) algorithm and from the fast retrieval scheme for cloud observables (fresco). cloud parameters from the o2?o2 (omi) algorithm have similar frequency distributions as cloud parameters retrieved from fresco (sciamachy) for august 2006. on average, omi cloud fractions are higher by 0.011, and omi cloud pressures exceed fresco cloud pressures by 60 hpa. as a consistency check, we intercompared omi near-real time no2 columns measured at 13:45 h local time to sciamachy off-line no2 columns measured at 10:00 h local time. in august 2006, both instruments observe very similar spatial patterns of tropospheric no2 columns, and small differences for most locations on earth where tropospheric no2 columns are small. for regions that are strongly polluted, sciamachy observes higher tropospheric no2 columns than omi.
typical monoterpenes as insecticides and repellents against stored grain pests global warming and deforestation have resulted in the relocation of many living creatures including insects during the recent years. this has affected the population balance of disease vectors including mosquitoes resulting in outbreaks. traditionally, mankind has been using plants as means of protection from the mosquitoes which are considered to be environment friendly unlike the synthetic chemicals that cause major risk to human health and the ecosystem. researchers explored mainly, essential oils and traditional plants using different testing methodologies to find out repellent molecules effective against mosquitoes which is the main focus of this review. among the promising plant species, eucalyptus spp., ocimum spp. and cymbopogon spp. are the most cited. data of repellency produced from the bioassay systems is difficult to quantify because of different parameters, testing system and standards of material used against mosquitoes. mainly, the human forearm based bioassays have been used with different sizes of treatment area in the laboratory and the results have not been tested in the field conditions for residual activity. in addition, effectiveness of essential oils and their protection time can be increased by using vanillin as synergist and formulation techniques like microencapsulation and nanoemulsion. there is a need to develop an alternate in vitro bioassay system that can address the problems of uniformity of the results.
the timing of signaling: to study in high school or in college? most previous research on effects of schooling has concluded that the effect of school or teacher quality on academic achievement is less than that of family background or other characteristics of students that predate entry into school. however, the evidence for that generalization is derived mainly from a few of the world's school systems (mostly in europe, north america, and japan). this paper explores diverse influences on pupil achievement in africa, asia, latin america, and the middle east. children who attend primary school in countries with low per capita incomes have learned substantially less after similar amounts of time in school than have pupils in high income countries. at the same time, the lower the income of the country, the weaker the influence of pupils' social status on achievement. conversely, in low-income countries, the effect of school and teacher quality on academic achievement in primary school is comparatively greater. from these data, which are more representative of the world's population of schoolchildren than those used in previous studies, it is possible to conclude that the predominant influence on student learning is the quality of the schools and teachers to which children are exposed.
hb tag modules for pcr‐based gene tagging and tandem affinity purification in saccharomyces cerevisiae we describe a new methodology, based on terminal perfusion of rodents with a reactive ester derivative of biotin that enables the covalent modification of proteins readily accessible from the bloodstream. biotinylated proteins from total organ extracts can be purified on streptavidin resin in the presence of strong detergents, digested on the resin and subjected to liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry for identification. in the present study, in vivo biotinylation procedure led to the identification of hundreds of proteins in different mouse organs, including some showing a restricted pattern of expression in certain body tissues. furthermore, biotinylation of mice with f9 subcutaneous tumors or orthotopic kidney tumors revealed both quantitative and qualitative differences in the recovery of biotinylated proteins, as compared to normal tissues. this technology is applicable to proteomic investigations of the differential expression of accessible proteins in physiological and pathological processes in animal models, and to human surgical specimens using ex vivo perfusion procedures.
re 2-cd : robust and energy efficient cut detection in wireless sensor networks we present two new leader election algorithms for mobile ad hoc networks. the algorithms ensure that eventually each connected component of the topology graph has exactly one leader. the algorithms are based on a routing algorithm called tora [5], which in turn is based on an algorithm by gafni and bertsekas [3]. the algorithm require nodes to communicate with only their current neighbors, making it well suited to the ad hoc environment. the first algorithm is for a single topology change and is provided with a proof of correctness. the second algorithm tolerates multiple concurrent topology changes.
titan cell production in cryptococcus neoformans reshapes the cell wall and capsule composition during infection the pathogenesis of cryptococcus neoformans infection has been studied extensively with respect to inflammatory and pathological changes, but very little information is available regarding the morphology of yeast cells during the course of infection. electron microscopy of cryptococcus neoformans in murine pulmonary infection revealed increased cell wall thickness with time, but this difference was only partially accounted for by increases in cell diameter. cell walls of melanized cells were thicker than those of nonmelanized cells 2 h after infection, and the cell wall of yeast became blacker with time, suggesting that melanization contributes to the increased cell wall thickness. heterogeneous cell populations emerged, with the appearance of giant forms. while for c. neoformans atcc strain 24067 (serotype d) the full spectrum of cell sizes were observed, for strains h99 (serotype a) and 3501 (serotype d) cells were divisible into two populations, giant and micro forms. in contrast to cellular heterogeneity, the epitope recognized by a protective mab on the capsular glucuronoxylomannan (gxm) was found at all times of infection. immunoelectron microscopy using mabs to gxm demonstrated reactivity with intracellular structures, suggesting that synthesis of capsular polysaccharide occurs, at least in part, in the cytoplasm. in summary, the results indicate that: (i) the infection is dynamic with respect to yeast cell morphology; (ii) giant cell forms arise in tissue during the course of infection; (iii) cell walls blacken and thicken during the course of infection, consistent with melanin synthesis during infection; and (iv) gxm epitopes are found in the capsule, cell wall and cytoplasm, consistent with intracellular polysaccharide synthesis. the results indicate that the population of c. neoformans cells in tissue is in a highly dynamic state, implying that the immune system must confront cells with varying characteristics during the course of infection.
epidemiology of leptospirosis in africa: a systematic review of a neglected zoonosis and a paradigm for ‘one health’ in africa leptospirosis is a widespread but under-reported cause of morbidity and mortality. global re-emergence of leptospirosis has been associated with the growth of informal urban settlements in which rodents are thought to be important reservoir hosts. understanding the multi-host epidemiology of leptospirosis is essential to control and prevent disease. a cross-sectional survey of rodents in the kibera settlement in nairobi, kenya was conducted in september–october 2008 to demonstrate the presence of pathogenic leptospires. a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed that 41 (18.3%) of 224 rodents carried pathogenic leptospires in their kidneys, and sequence data identified leptospira interrogans and l. kirschneri in this population. rodents of the genus mus (37 of 185) were significantly more likely to be positive than those of the genus rattus (4 of 39; odds ratio = 15.03). questionnaire data showed frequent contact between humans and rodents in kibera. this study emphasizes the need to quantify the public health impacts of this neglected disease at this and other urban sites in africa.
dopamine modulates persistent synaptic activity and enhances the signal-to-noise ratio in the prefrontal cortex a large body of phenomenological evidence implicates abnormal connectivity of brain macrocircuitry and microcircuitry in schizophrenia. recent discoveries of susceptibility genes for schizophrenia have zeroed in on the synaptic signaling machinery of cortical microcircuits as fundamental to disease causation and have militated for further revision of the role of dopamine in this illness. dopamine, long implicated in psychosis and in antipsychotic drug effects, is crucial in optimizing signal-to-noise ratio of local cortical microcircuits. this action of dopamine is achieved principally by d1- and d2-receptor-mediated effects on pyramidal and local circuit neurons, which mediate neuronal excitability and recurrent inhibition and thus contribute to the stability of cortical representations of external and internal stimuli. in schizophrenia, an abnormal cortical dopamine d1/d2 activation ratio - in concert with, and in part related to, altered gaba and glutamate transmission - appears to interfere crucially with this process.
aged black garlic extract induces inhibition of gastric cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. garlic [allium sativum] is among the oldest of all cultivated plants. it has been used as a medicinal agent for thousands of years. it is a remarkable plant, which has multiple beneficial effects such as antimicrobial, antithrombotic, hypolipidemic, antiarthritic, hypoglycemic and antitumor activity. in this review, we will discuss particularly the largely preclinical use of this agent in the treatment and prevention of cancer. a number of studies have demonstrated the chemopreventive activity of garlic by using different garlic preparations including fresh garlic extract, aged garlic, garlic oil and a number of organosulfur compounds derived from garlic. the chemopreventive activity has been attributed to the presence of organosulfur compounds in garlic. how this is achieved is not fully understood, but several modes of action have been proposed. these include its effect on drug metabolizing enzymes, antioxidant properties and tumor growth inhibition. most of these studies were carried out in the animal models. also, recent research has focused on the antimutagenic activity of garlic. recently, it has been observed that aged garlic extract, but not the fresh garlic extract, exhibited radical scavenging activity. the two major compounds in aged garlic, s-allylcysteine and s-allylmercapto-l-cysteine, had the highest radical scavenging activity. in addition, some organosulfur compounds derived from garlic, including s-allylcysteine, have been found to retard the growth of chemically induced and transplantable tumors in several animal models. therefore, the consumption of garlic may provide some kind of protection from cancer development.
design and evaluation of prophylactic interventions using infectious disease incidence data from close contact groups. for the first wave of pandemic influenza or a bioterrorist influenza attack, antiviral agents would be one of the few options to contain the epidemic in the united states until adequate supplies of vaccine were available. the authors use stochastic epidemic simulations to investigate the effectiveness of targeted antiviral prophylaxis to contain influenza. in this strategy, close contacts of suspected index influenza cases take antiviral agents prophylactically. the authors compare targeted antiviral prophylaxis with vaccination strategies. they model an influenza pandemic or bioterrorist attack for an agent similar to influenza a virus (h2n2) that caused the asian influenza pandemic of 1957-1958. in the absence of intervention, the model predicts an influenza illness attack rate of 33% of the population (95% confidence interval (ci): 30, 37) and an influenza death rate of 0.58 deaths/1,000 persons (95% cl: 0.4, 0.8). with the use of targeted antiviral prophylaxis, if 80% of the exposed persons maintained prophylaxis for up to 8 weeks, the epidemic would be contained, and the model predicts a reduction to an illness attack rate of 2% (95% cl: 0.2, 16) and a death rate of 0.04 deaths/1,000 persons (95% ci: 0.0003, 0.25). such antiviral prophylaxis is nearly as effective as vaccinating 80% of the population. vaccinating 80% of the children aged less than 19 years is almost as effective as vaccinating 80% of the population. targeted antiviral prophylaxis has potential as an effective measure for containing influenza until adequate quantities of vaccine are available.
inborn errors of metabolism and the human interactome: a systems medicine approach given the functional interdependencies between the molecular components in a human cell, a disease is rarely a consequence of an abnormality in a single gene, but reflects the perturbations of the complex intracellular and intercellular network that links tissue and organ systems. the emerging tools of network medicine offer a platform to explore systematically not only the molecular complexity of a particular disease, leading to the identification of disease modules and pathways, but also the molecular relationships among apparently distinct (patho)phenotypes. advances in this direction are essential for identifying new disease genes, for uncovering the biological significance of disease-associated mutations identified by genome-wide association studies and full-genome sequencing, and for identifying drug targets and biomarkers for complex diseases.
the anti-adhesive mode of action of a purified mushroom (lentinus edodes) extract with anticaries and antigingivitis properties in two oral bacterial phatogens although hemin is an indispensable nutrient for the oral pathogen prevotella intermedia, not much is known regarding the molecular mechanisms of hemin acquisition. the availability of the genomic sequence of the bacterium allowed us to apply proteomic approaches to identify proteins that may be mediating the hemin acquisition process. as hemin acquisition mechanisms have been shown to be induced in iron‐depleted conditions, we applied proteomic approaches to detect those proteins whose expressions were affected by iron. we analyzed 40 protein spots and identified 19 such proteins. interestingly, two proteins drastically upregulated in iron‐depleted conditions, pin0009 and pina0611, are homologs of hemin uptake receptors in other bacteria. pin0009 is predicted to be an outer membrane lipoprotein. it is encoded by a gene that is the first of a seven‐gene genomic locus encoding proteins of a novel hemin acquisition system. the second protein, pina0611, is a homolog of numerous tonb‐dependent outer membrane receptors including outer membrane iron uptake receptors of various gram‐negative bacteria. there was also another protein, regulated by iron, that was previously demonstrated to bind hemoglobin in p. intermedia. finally, we identified a thioredoxin‐like protein that has a novel outer membrane location.
higher education dominance and siloed knowledge: a systematic review of flipped classroom research recent calls for educational reform highlight ongoing concerns about the ability of current curricula to equip aspiring health care professionals with the skills for success. whereas a wide range of proposed solutions attempt to address apparent deficiencies in current educational models, a growing body of literature consistently points to the need to rethink the traditional in-class, lecture-based course model. one such proposal is the flipped classroom, in which content is offloaded for students to learn on their own, and class time is dedicated to engaging students in student-centered learning activities, like problem-based learning and inquiry-oriented strategies. in 2012, the authors flipped a required first-year pharmaceutics course at the university of north carolina eshelman school of pharmacy. they offloaded all lectures to self-paced online videos and used class time to engage students in active learning exercises. in this article, the authors describe the philosophy and methodology used to redesign the basic pharmaceutics ii course and outline the research they conducted to investigate the resulting outcomes. this article is intended to serve as a guide to instructors and educational programs seeking to develop, implement, and evaluate innovative and practical strategies to transform students’ learning experience. as class attendance, students’ learning, and the perceived value of this model all increased following participation in the flipped classroom, the authors conclude that this approach warrants careful consideration as educators aim to enhance learning, improve outcomes, and fully equip students to address 21st-century health care needs.
measuring multiple parameters of cd8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in human cancers by image analysis immune cell infiltration is common to many tumors and has been recognized by pathologists for more than 100 years. the application of digital imaging and objective assessment software allowed a concise determination of the type and quantity of immune cells and their location relative to the tumor and, in the case of colon cancer, characterized overall survival better than ajcc tnm staging. subsequently, expression of pd-l1, by 50% or more tumor cells, identified nsclc patients with double the response rate to anti-pd-1. soon, automated staining methods will improve reproducibility of multiplex staining and allow for clia standards so that multiplex staining can be used to make clinical decisions. ultimately, machine-learning algorithms will help interpret data from tissue images and lead to improved delivery of precision medicine.
field isotopic study of lead fate and compartmentalization in earthworm-soil-metal particle systems for highly polluted soil near pb recycling factory. the importance of earthworms to ecosystem functioning has led to many studies on the impacts of metals on earthworms. far less attention has been paid to the impact that earthworms have on soil metals both in terms of metal mobility and availability. in this review we consider which earthworms have been used in such studies, which soil components have been investigated, which types of soil have been used and what measures of mobility and availability applied. we proceed to review proposed reasons for effects: changes in microbial populations, ph, dissolved organic carbon and metal speciation. the balance of evidence suggests that earthworms increase metal mobility and availability but more studies are required to determine the precise mechanism for this.
macroalgae of izmir gulf: dictyotaceae exhibit high in vitro anti-cancer activity independent from their antioxidant capabilities reactive oxygen species are widely generated in biological systems. consequently humans have evolved antioxidant defence systems that limit their production. intracellular production of active oxygen species such as ± oh, o2 and h2o2 is associated with the arrest of cell proliferation. similarly, generation of oxidative stress in response to various external stimuli has been implicated in the activation of transcription factors and to the triggering of apoptosis. here we review how free radicals induce dna sequence changes in the form of mutations, deletions, gene ampli®cation and rearrangements. these alterations may result in the initiation of apoptosis signalling leading to cell death, or to the activation of several proto-oncogenes and/or the inactivation of some tumour suppressor genes. the regulation of gene expression by means of oxidants, antioxidants and the redox state remains as a promising therapeutic approach. several anticarcinogenic agents have been shown to inhibit reactive oxygen species production and oxidative dna damage, inhibiting tumour promotion. in addition, recombinant vectors expressing radical-scavenging enzymes reduce apoptosis. in conclusion, oxidative stress has been implicated in both apoptosis and the pathogenesis of cancer providing contrived support for two notions: free radical reactions may be increased in malignant cells and oxidant scavenging systems may be useful in cancer therapy. # 2000 published by elsevier science ltd. all rights reserved.
dose reduction for kilovotage cone-beam computed tomography in radiation therapy. it was recently reported that the real-time flat panel detector-based cone-beam computed tomography (cbct) breast imaging can help improve the detectability of small breast tumors with an x-ray dose comparable to that of the conventional mammography. in this paper, an efficient denoising algorithm is proposed to further reduce the x-ray exposure level required by a cbct scan to acquire acceptable image quality. the proposed wavelet-based denoising algorithm possesses three significant characteristics: 1) wavelet coefficients at each scale are classified into two categories: irregular coefficients, and edge-related and regular coefficients; 2) noise in irregular coefficients is reduced as much as possible without producing artifacts to the denoised images; and 3) for the edge-related and regular coefficients, if they are at the first decomposition level, they are further denoised, otherwise, no modifications are made to them so as to obtain good visual quality for diagnosis. by applying the proposed denoising algorithm to the filtered projection images, the x-ray exposure level necessary for the cbct scan can he reduced by up to 60% while obtaining clinically acceptable image quality. this denoising result indicates that in the clinical application of cbct breast imaging, the patient radiation dose can be significantly reduced.
treatment options for hcv genotype-4 background and aims it is unknown whether socioeconomic status (ses) is a risk factor for hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection or a prognostic factor following infection. methods from danish nationwide registries, we obtained information on three markers of ses: employment, income, and education. in a case control design, we examined hcv infected patients and controls; conditional logistic regression was employed to obtain odds ratios (ors) for hcv infection for each of the three ses markers, adjusting for the other two ses markers, comorbidity, and substance abuse. in a cohort design, we used cox regression analysis to compute mortality rate ratios (mrrs) for each of the three ses markers, adjusting for the other two ses markers, comorbidity level, age, substance abuse, and gender. results when compared to employed persons, ors for hcv infection were 2.71 (95% confidence interval [ci]: 2.24–3.26) for disability pensioners and 2.24 (95% ci: 1.83–2.72) for the unemployed. when compared to persons with a high income, ors were 1.64 (95% ci: 1.34–2.01) for low income persons and 1.19 (95% ci: 1.02–1.40) for medium income persons. the or was 1.35 (95% ci: 1.20–1.52) for low education (no more than basic schooling). when compared to employed patients, mrrs were 1.71 (95% ci: 1.22–2.40) for unemployed patients and 2.24 (95% ci: 1.63–3.08) for disability pensioners. when compared to high income patients, mrrs were 1.47 (95% ci: 1.05–2.05) for medium income patients and 1.64 (95% ci: 1.13–2.34) for low income patients. educational status was not associated with mortality. conclusion low ses was associated with an increased risk of hcv infection and with poor prognosis in hcv infected patients.
problem based management learning-better online? what are focus groups? how are they distinct from ordinary group discussions and what use are they anyway? this article introduces focus group methodology, explores ways of conducting such groups and examines what this technique of data collection can offer researchers in general and medical sociologists in particular. it concentrates on the one feature which inevitably distinguishes focus groups from one-to-one interviews or questionnaires – namely the interaction between research participants - and argues for the overt exploration and exploitation of such interaction in the research process.
biobran/mgn-3, an arabinoxylan rice bran, enhances nk cell activity in geriatric subjects: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial background aims natural killer cell (nk) cytotoxic activity plays a major role in natural immunologic defences against malignancies. nk cells are emerging as a tool for adoptive cancer immunotherapies. arabinoxylan rice bran (mgn-3/biobran) has been described as a biological response modifier that can enhance the cytotoxic activity of nk cells. this study evaluated the effect of mgn-3/biobran on nk cell activation, expansion and cytotoxicity against neuroblastoma cells.   methods nk cells were enriched with magnetic beads and stimulated with mgn-3/biobran. nk cell activation was evaluated via analysis of their phenotype, and their expansion capability was tracked. the in vitro cytotoxic ability of the activated nk cells was tested against k562, jurkat, a673, nb1691, a-204, rd and rh-30 cell lines and the in vivo cytotoxic ability against the nb1691 cell line.   results mgn-3/biobran stimulation of nk cells induced a higher expression of the activation-associated receptors cd25 and cd69 than in unstimulated cells (p < 0.05). the expression of nkg2d, dnam, ncrs and tlrs remained unchanged. overnight mgn-3/biobran stimulation increased nk cell cytotoxic activity against all cell lines tested in vitro and decelerated neuroblastoma growth in vivo. the mechanism is not mediated by lipopolysaccharide contamination in mgn-3/biobran. furthermore, the addition of mgn-3/biobran promoted nk cell expansion and decreased t cells in vitro.   conclusions our data show that mgn-3/biobran upregulates nk cell activation markers, stimulates nk cell cytotoxic activity against neuroblastoma in vitro and in vivo and selectively augments the expansion of nk cells. these results may be useful for future nk cell therapeutic strategies of the treatment of neuroblastoma.
transcriptomic and functional pathway analysis of human cervical carcinoma cancer cells response to microtubule inhibitor our previous study had demonstrated that astragalus saponins (ast) could reduce the side effects of orthodox chemotherapeutic drugs, while concurrently promote antitumor activity. in the present study, we attempted to investigate the potential synergistic anticarcinogenic effects of ast and a vinca alkaloid vinblastine (vbl). reduced expression of key proangiogenic and metastatic factors including vegf, bfgf, metalloproteinase (mmp)-2, and mmp-9 was detected in vbl-treated colon cancer cells, with further downregulation by combined vbl/ast treatment. subsequently, vbl or ast decreased lovo cell invasiveness, with further reduction when the drugs were cotreated. significant growth inhibition and cell cycle arrest at g2/m phase were achieved by either drug treatment with apparent synergistic effects. vbl-induced apoptosis was confirmed but found to be unrelated to induction of the novel apoptotic protein nsaid-activated gene 1. in vivo study in tumor xenograft indicates that combined vbl/ast treatment resulted in sustained regression of tumor growth, with attenuation of the neutropenic and anemic effects of vbl. in addition, downregulation of proangiogenic and proliferative factors was also visualized, with boosting effect by combined drug treatment. these findings have provided evidence that ast combined with adjuvant chemotherapeutics like vbl could alleviate cancer development through diversified modes of action, including the regulation of angiogenesis.
cyclicity and variability in prey dynamics strengthens predator numerical response: the effects of vole fluctuations on white stork productivity to model the effects of global climate phenomena on avian population dynamics, we must identify and quantify the spatial and temporal relationships between climate, weather and bird populations. previous studies show that in europe, the north atlantic oscillation (nao) influences winter and spring weather that in turn affects resident and migratory landbird species. similarly, in north america, the el nifno/ southern oscillation (enso) of the pacific ocean reportedly drives weather patterns that affect prey availability and population dynamics of landbird species which winter in the caribbean. here we show that enso- and nao-induced seasonal weather conditions differentially affect neotropicaland temperate-wintering landbird species that breed in pacific north-west forests of north america. for neotropical species wintering in western mexico, el nifio conditions correlate with cooler, wetter conditions prior to spring migration, and with high reproductive success the following summer. for temperate wintering species, springtime nao indices correlate strongly with levels of forest defoliation by the larvae of two moth species and also with annual reproductive success, especially among species known to prey upon those larvae. generalized linear models incorporating nao indices and enso precipitation indices explain 50-90% of the annual variation in productivity reported for 10 landbird species. these results represent an important step towards spatially explicit modelling of avian population dynamics at regional scales.
noninferiority trial designs for odds ratios and risk differences. background in the setting of percutaneous coronary revascularization, agents in the class known as platelet glycoprotein iib/iiia inhibitors have significantly reduced the incidence of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction at 30 days. we assessed whether there are differences in safety or efficacy between two such inhibitors, tirofiban and abciximab.   methods using a double-blind, double-dummy design at 149 hospitals in 18 countries, we randomly assigned patients to receive either tirofiban or abciximab before undergoing percutaneous coronary revascularization with the intent to perform stenting. the primary end point was a composite of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or urgent target-vessel revascularization at 30 days. the trial was designed and statistically powered to demonstrate the noninferiority of tirofiban as compared with abciximab.   results the primary end point occurred more frequently among the 2398 patients in the tirofiban group than among the 2411 patients in the abciximab group (7.6 percent vs. 6.0 percent; hazard ratio, 1.26; one-sided 95 percent confidence interval of 1.51, demonstrating lack of equivalence, and two-sided 95 percent confidence interval of 1.01 to 1.57, demonstrating the superiority of abciximab over tirofiban; p=0.038). the magnitude and the direction of the effect were similar for each component of the composite end point (hazard ratio for death, 1.21; hazard ratio for myocardial infarction, 1.27; and hazard ratio for urgent target-vessel revascularization, 1.26), and the difference in the incidence of myocardial infarction between the tirofiban group and the abciximab group was significant (6.9 percent and 5.4 percent, respectively; p=0.04). the relative benefit of abciximab was consistent regardless of age, sex, the presence or absence of diabetes, or the presence or absence of pretreatment with clopidogrel. there were no significant differences in the rates of major bleeding complications or transfusions, but tirofiban was associated with a lower rate of minor bleeding episodes and thrombocytopenia.   conclusions although the trial was intended to assess the noninferiority of tirofiban as compared with abciximab, the findings demonstrated that tirofiban offered less protection from major ischemic events than did abciximab.
innate differences in the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the regions within the extended amygdala between alcohol preferring and nonpreferring rats. abstract: the neuropeptide‐inducing activity of neurotrophic factors was tested in cultured cerebral cortical neurons. brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) specifically increased contents of the neuropeptides somatostatin (som) and neuropeptide y (npy), but its effect on contents of cholecystokinin octapeptide and gaba was much less significant. the maximal induction of npy content (15‐fold increase) was achieved by 20 ng/ml of bdnf. these changes were also reproduced at the mrna level. in contrast, neurotrophin‐3 was much less potent at increasing npy and som contents, and nerve growth factor had no effect on them. the expression of mrna for npy and som was fully dependent on the presence of bdnf in culture but irrelevant to the survival‐promoting activity of bdnf, which has been reported previously. most of the npy immunoreactivity induced by bdnf was colocalized with glutamate decarboxylase immunoreactivity in cultured cortical neurons. these results suggest that bdnf regulates the peptidergic expression of gabaergic neurons in the cerebral cortex.
intracerebroventricular administration of ouabain alters synaptic plasticity and dopamine release in rat medial prefrontal cortex background psychological processes in bipolar disorder are of both clinical and theoretical importance.   aims to examine depressogenic psychological processes and reward responsivity in relation to different mood episodes (mania, depression, remission) and bipolar symptomatology.   method one hundred and seven individuals with bipolar disorder (34 in a manic/hypomanic or mixed affective state; 30 in a depressed state and 43 who were euthymic) and 41 healthy controls were interviewed with structured clinical interview for dsm-iv and completed a battery of self-rated and experimental measures assessing negative cognitive styles, coping response to negative affect, self-esteem stability and reward responsiveness.   results individuals in all episodes differed from controls on most depression-related and reward responsivity measures. however, correlational analyses revealed clear relationships between negative cognitive styles and depressive symptoms, and reward responsivity and manic symptoms.   conclusions separate psychological processes are implicated in depression and mania, but cognitive vulnerability to depression is evident even in patients who are euthymic.
suppression of experimental choroidal neovascularization utilizing kdr selective receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor background retinal ischemia induces intraocular neovascularization, which often leads to glaucoma, vitreous hemorrhage, and retinal detachment, presumably by stimulating the release of angiogenic molecules. vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) is an endothelial-cell-specific angiogenic factor whose production is increased by hypoxia.   methods we measured the concentration of vegf in 210 specimens of ocular fluid obtained from 164 patients undergoing intraocular surgery, using both radioimmuno-assays and radioreceptor assays. vitreous proliferative potential was measured with in vitro assays of the growth of retinal endothelial cells and with vegf-neutralizing antibody.   results vegf was detected in 69 of 136 ocular-fluid samples from patients with diabetic retinopathy, 29 of 38 samples from patients with neovascularization of the iris, and 3 of 4 samples from patients with ischemic occlusion of the central retinal vein, as compared with 2 of 31 samples from patients with no neovascular disorders (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, and p = 0.006, respectively). the mean (+/- sd) vegf concentration in 70 samples of ocular fluid from patients with active proliferative diabetic retinopathy (3.6 +/- 6.3 ng per milliliter) was higher than that in 25 samples from patients with nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (0.1 +/- 0.1 ng per milliliter, p = 0.008), 41 samples from patients with quiescent proliferative diabetic retinopathy (0.2 +/- 0.6 ng per milliliter, p < 0.001), or 31 samples from nondiabetic patients (0.1 +/- 0.2 ng per milliliter, p = 0.003). concentrations of vegf in vitreous fluid (8.8 +/- 9.9 ng per milliliter) were higher than those in aqueous fluid (5.6 +/- 8.6 ng per milliliter, p = 0.033) in all 10 pairs of samples obtained simultaneously from the same patient; vegf concentrations in vitreous fluid declined after successful laser photocoagulation. vegf stimulated the growth of retinal endothelial cells in vitro, as did vitreous fluid containing measurable vegf. stimulation was inhibited by vegf-neutralizing antibodies.   conclusions our data suggest that vegf plays a major part in mediating active intraocular neovascularization in patients with ischemic retinal diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy and retinal-vein occlusion.
baseline study to determine in vitro activities of daptomycin against gram-positive pathogens isolated in the united states in 2000-2001 daptomycin mics were determined for 844 gram-positive bacteria in three concentrations of ca(++) and compared with the mics of vancomycin and teicoplanin. daptomycin was twofold to fourfold more active against most species when tested in 50 microg/ml of ca(++) than in 25 microg/ml. in 50 microg/ml of ca(++) daptomycin was more active against methicillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci than teicoplanin or vancomycin; 100% of these isolates were susceptible to < or =2.0 microg/ml of daptomycin. different lots of mueller-hinton agar were variable in ca(++) content, and daptomycin disk diffusion zone diameters were affected, i.e., zones were 1 to 15 mm smaller on one lot of agar with only 6 microg/ml of ca(++) compared to another lot with 28 microg/ml. the previously proposed daptomycin interpretive breakpoints performed satisfactorily when mics were determined in mueller-hinton broth with 50 microg/ml of ca(++) and when the agar gave appropriate zones with quality control strains. to define those control limits, replicate tests with four quality control strains were performed in ten laboratories using broth microdilution tests (with ca(++) supplemented broth) and disk diffusion tests on mueller-hinton agar without cation adjustments.
adipophilin affects the expression of tnf-α, mcp-1, and il-6 in thp-1 macrophages objective—reduced plasma concentrations of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (hdl-c) are a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease. mechanisms that regulate hdl-c concentrations represent an important area of investigation. methods and results—comparative transcriptome analyses of monocyte-derived macrophages (mdm) from a large population of low hdl-c subjects and age- and sex-matched controls revealed a cluster of inflammatory genes highly expressed in low hdl-c subjects. the expression levels of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (ppar) γ and several antioxidant metallothionein genes were decreased in mdm from all low hdl-c groups compared with controls, as was the expression of other genes regulated by pparγ, including cd36, adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (fabp4), and adipophilin (adfp). in contrast, pparδ expression was increased in mdm from low hdl-c groups. quantitative rt-pcr corroborated all major findings from the microarray analysis in two separate patient cohorts. expression of several inflammatory cytokine genes including interleukin 1β, interleukin 8, and tumor necrosis factor α were highly increased in low hdl-c subjects. conclusions—the activated proinflammatory state of monocytes and mdm in low hdl-c subjects constitutes a novel parameter of risk associated with hdl deficiency, related to altered expression of metallothionein genes and the reciprocal regulation of pparγ and pparδ.
long-term visual acuity results of treated and untreated radiation retinopathy it is suspected that radiation retinopathy is more likely to develop in an eye with preexisting diabetic retinopathy than in a normal eye. however, there is only one report of this occurring, at a radiation dose of 4500 rads. we present a woman with minimal diabetic retinopathy who had breast carcinoma which was treated with chemotherapy but metastasised to the choroid. within nine months of external beam radiation (3000 rads in fractions of 200 rads) a fulminant retinopathy evolved in that eye, while the non-radiated eye showed no change. the histopathology of radiation and diabetic retinopathy and causes for possible synergism are discussed. as this case report shows, radiation oncologists and ophthalmologists need to be aware of the risk that patients with minimal diabetic retinopathy who have undergone chemotherapy may suffer a dramatic visual loss from radiation therapy despite a radiation dose which is considered adequate, safe, and properly fractionated.
the synthetic cannabinoid win55212‐2 decreases the intraocular pressure in human glaucoma resistant to conventional therapies we used reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to detect the expression of the central and peripheral cannabinoid receptors (cb1 and cb2, respectively) mrna, and western blotting to show the presence of the cb1 protein in subregions of the human eye. cb2 mrna transcripts were undetectable, while levels of cb1 mrna were significantly expressed in the human retina (25.8 ± 2.46%), ciliary body (210 ± 11.55%) and iris (62.7 ± 5.94%) when compared with those of the normalizing reference gene β2 microglobulin. the cb1 gene encodes a functional protein which is detected in its glycosylated (63 kda) and unglycosylated (54 kda) form in the same areas by a specific purified antibody raised against the amino terminus (residues 1–77) of the cb1 receptor. these results further support the proposed role of the cb1 receptor in controlling intraocular pressure, helping to explain the antiglaucoma properties of marijuana.
key-recovery attacks on universal hash function based mac algorithms we describe a message authentication algorithm, umac, which can authenticate messages (in software, on contemporary machines) roughly an order of magnitude faster than current practice (e.g., hmac-sha1), and about twice as fast as times previously reported for the universal hash-function family mmh. to achieve such speeds, umac uses a new universal hash-function family, nh, and a design which allows effective exploitation of simd parallelism. the "cryptographic" work of umac is done using standard primitives of the user's choice, such as a block cipher or cryptographic hash function; no new heuristic primitives are developed here. instead, the security of umac is rigorously proven, in the sense of giving exact and quantitatively strong results which demonstrate an inability to forge umac-authenticated messages assuming an inability to break the underlying cryptographic primitive. unlike conventional, inherently serial macs, umac is parallelizable, and will have ever-faster implementation speeds as machines offer up increasing amounts of parallelism. we envision umac as a practical algorithm for next-generation message authentication.
ovariectomy and 17β-estradiol replacement play a role on the expression of endonuclease-g and phosphorylated cyclic amp response element-binding (creb) protein in hippocampus apoptosis contributes to cell death in common intensive care unit disorders such as traumatic brain injury and sepsis. recent evidence suggests that this form of cell death is both clinically relevant and a potential therapeutic target in critical illness. mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ros) have become a target for drug discovery in recent years since their production is characteristic of early stages of apoptosis. among many antioxidant agents, stable nitroxide radicals targeted to mitochondria have attracted attention due to their ability to combine electron and free radical scavenging action with recycling capacities. specific mechanisms of enhanced ros generation in mitochondria and their translation into apoptotic signals are not well understood. this review focuses on several contemporary aspects of oxidative stress-mediated mitochondrial injury, particularly as they relate to oxidation of lipids and their specific signaling roles in apoptosis and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells.
the fat mass and obesity-associated fto rs9939609 polymorphism is associated with elevated homocysteine levels in patients with multiple sclerosis screened for vascular risk factors it is important to be able to evaluate vitamin status correctly at any age, but this is especially vital during adolescence since there are higher requirements for healthy growth and development. however, there are no currently available b-vitamin reference values for healthy adolescents. the aim of the present study is to assess the vitamin b status in european adolescents in order to contribute to the development of reference values for selected b-vitamins and total homocysteine (thcy). within the helena (healthy lifestyle in europe by nutrition in adolescence) cross-sectional study, a sub sample of 1051 (499 males, 552 females) adolescents from ten european cities aged 12.5 to 17.49 were analyzed for fasting plasma folate (pf), red blood cell (rbc) folate, serum cobalamin (cbl), holo-transcobalamin (holo-tc), vitamin b(6) (plp), and thcy. the level of significance was set at p < .05. following the current cut-off for adults, 2% had low cbl and 5% had low holo-tc concentrations. low concentrations of both pf and rbc folate were identified in 10%. five percent had plp concentrations <20 nmol/l and 20% <30 nmol/l. moreover, 5% had high thcy; median values for the whole sample were: pf 16.0 nmol/l, rbc folate 721.9 nmol/l, cbl 319 pmol/l, holo-tc 57.8 pmol/l, and thcy 6.7 μmol/l. females had significantly higher median cbl but lower plp and thcy concentrations (p < .01). thcy increased (p < .001) and pf (p < .001) concentrations decreased across age categories. subjects showed significantly higher thcy values at the fifth percentile of pf, corresponding with 7.5 nmol/l. sex and age had an influence on most of the studied biomarkers and should be taken into account. the helena percentile distribution is consistent with data from smaller studies and could be used as reference value to characterize b-vitamin status of european adolescents.
estimating stand volume in broad-leaved forest using discrete-return lidar: plot-based approach the main objective of this study was to develop reliable processing and analysis techniques to facilitate the use of small-footprint lidar data for estimating tree crown diameter by measuring individual trees identifiable on the three-dimensional lidar surface. in addition, the study explored the importance of the lidar-derived crown diameter for estimating tree volume and biomass. the lidar dataset was acquired over deciduous, coniferous, and mixed stands of varying age classes and settings typical of the southeastern united states. for identifying individual trees, lidar processing techniques used data fusion with multispectral optical data and local filtering with both square and circular windows of variable size. the crown diameter was calculated as the average of two values measured along two perpendicular directions from the location of each tree top by fitting a fourth-degree polynomial on both profiles. the lidar-derived tree measurements were used with regression models and cross-validation to estimate plot level field-measured crown diameter. linear regression was also used to compare plot level tree volume and biomass estimation with and without lidar-derived crown diameter measures from individual trees. results for estimating crown diameter were similar for both pines and deciduous trees, with r2 values of 0.62‐0.63 for the dominant trees (root mean square error (rmse) 1.36 to 1.41 m). lidar-measured crown diameter improved r2 values for volume and biomass estimation by up to 0.25 for both pines and deciduous plots (rmse improved by up to 8 m3/ha for volume and 7 mg/ha for biomass). for the pine plots, average crown diameter alone explained 78% of the variance associated with biomass (rmse 31.28 mg/ha) and 83% of the variance for volume (rmse 47.90 m3/ha).
derlin-1 regulates mutant vcp-linked pathogenesis and endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis elimination of misfolded proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (er) by retro-translocation is an important physiological adaptation to er stress. this process requires recognition of a substrate in the er lumen and its subsequent movement through the membrane by the cytosolic p97 atpase. here we identify a p97-interacting membrane protein complex in the mammalian er that links these two events. the central component of the complex, derlin-1, is a homologue of der1, a yeast protein whose inactivation prevents the elimination of misfolded luminal er proteins. derlin-1 associates with different substrates as they move through the membrane, and inactivation of derlin-1 in c. elegans causes er stress. derlin-1 interacts with us11, a virally encoded er protein that specifically targets mhc class i heavy chains for export from the er, as well as with vimp, a novel membrane protein that recruits the p97 atpase and its cofactor.
trf1 promotes parallel pairing of telomeric tracts in vitro. the yeast protein rap1 is a sequence-specific dna-binding protein that binds to many promoters, to two elements that silence mating-type genes, and to [(c)1-3a]n tracts at telomeres. rap1 is essential for cell viability and can function as either an activator or a repressor of transcription, depending upon the context of its binding site. recent experiments suggest that its function may be determined by different sets of protein-protein interactions at promoters and silencers. at the ends of chromosomes, rap1 plays an important role in both silencing (telomere position effect) and telomere structure.
cloning and bacterial expression of hemagglutinin antigen stem of h9n2 avian influenza virus wild aquatic bird populations have long been considered the natural reservoir for influenza a viruses with virus transmission from these birds seeding other avian and mammalian hosts. while most evidence still supports this dogma, recent studies in bats have suggested other reservoir species may also exist. extensive surveillance studies coupled with an enhanced awareness in response to h5n1 and pandemic 2009 h1n1 outbreaks is also revealing a growing list of animals susceptible to infection with influenza a viruses. although in a relatively stable host-pathogen interaction in aquatic birds, antigenic, and genetic evolution of influenza a viruses often accompanies interspecies transmission as the virus adapts to a new host. the evolutionary changes in the new hosts result from a number of processes including mutation, reassortment, and recombination. depending on host and virus these changes can be accompanied by disease outbreaks impacting wildlife, veterinary, and public health.
effects of exogenous cortisol on the gh/igf-i/igfbp network in channel catfish. we have studied the control of expression of the human growth hormone (hgh) gene introduced into the chromosomes of mouse fibroblasts. cell lines transformed with the hgh gene expressed low levels of intact hgh mrna and secreted hgh protein into the medium. although the level of expression of hgh mrna was low, the gene remained responsive to induction by glucocorticoid hormones. to localize the sequences responsible for induction and to determine the mechanism by which these cis-acting sequences enhance gene expression, we have constructed a series of fusion genes between the hgh gene and the herpes simplex virus (hsv) thymidine kinase (tk) gene. we have demonstrated that a fusion gene in which hgh cdna is flanked at its 5' terminus by an hsv tk promoter and is flanked at its 3' terminus by 3' hsv tk dna remains inducible by glucocorticoids. our studies indicate that the hgh exons contain sequences which are responsible for glucocorticoid hormone induction. pulse-chase experiments, in vitro nuclear transcription, and approach to steady-state measurements indicate that the mechanisms responsible for induction of the hgh cdna fusion gene operate posttranscriptionally to enhance the stability of hgh mrna. moreover, this increased stability was associated with an increase in the length of the 3' poly(a) tail on hgh mrna.
early metazoan divergence was about 830 million years ago previously we suggested that four proteins including aldolase and triose phosphate isomerase (tpi) evolved with approximately constant rates over long periods covering the whole animal phyla. the constant rates of aldolase and tpi evolution were reexamined based on three different models for estimating evolutionary distances. it was shown that the evolutionary rates remain essentially unchanged in comparisons not only between different classes of vertebrates but also between vertebrates and arthropods and even between animals and plants, irrespective of the models used. thus these enzymes might be useful molecular clocks for inferring divergence times of animal phyla. to know the divergence time of parazoa and eumetazoa and that of cephalochordata and vertebrata, the aldolase cdnas from ephydatia fluviatilis, a freshwater sponge, and the tpi cdnas from ephydatia fluviatilis and branchiostoma belcheri, an amphioxus, have been cloned and se-quenced. comparisons of the deduced amino acid sequences of aldolase and tpi from the freshwater sponge with known sequences revealed that the parazoa-eumetazoa split occurred about 940 million years ago (ma) as determined by the average of two proteins and three models. similarly, the aldolase and tpi clocks suggest that vertebrates and amphioxus last shared a common ancestor around 700 ma and they possibly diverged shortly after the divergence of deuterostomes and protostomes.
neonatal human retinal pigment epithelial cells secrete limited trophic factors in vitro and in vivo following striatal implantation in parkinsonian rats melanins can be classified into two major groups—insoluble brown to black pigments termed eumelanin and alkali‐soluble yellow to reddish‐brown pigments termed pheomelanin. both types of pigment derive from the common precursor dopaquinone (ortho‐quinone of 3,4‐dihydroxyphenylalanine) which is formed via the oxidation of l‐tyrosine by the melanogenic enzyme tyrosinase. dopaquinone is a highly reactive ortho‐quinone that plays pivotal roles in the chemical control of melanogenesis. in the absence of sulfhydryl compounds, dopaquinone undergoes intramolecular cyclization to form cyclodopa, which is then rapidly oxidized by a redox reaction with dopaquinone to give dopachrome (and dopa). dopachrome then gradually and spontaneously rearranges to form 5,6‐dihydroxyindole and to a lesser extent 5,6‐dihydroxyindole‐2‐carboxylic acid, the ratio of which is determined by a distinct melanogenic enzyme termed dopachrome tautomerase (tyrosinase‐related protein‐2). oxidation and subsequent polymerization of these dihydroxyindoles leads to the production of eumelanin. however, when cysteine is present, this process gives rise preferentially to the production of cysteinyldopa isomers. cysteinyldopas are subsequently oxidized through redox reaction with dopaquinone to form cysteinyldopaquinones that eventually lead to the production of pheomelanin. pulse radiolysis studies of early stages of melanogenesis (involving dopaquinone and cysteine) indicate that mixed melanogenesis proceeds in three distinct stages—the initial production of cysteinyldopas, followed by their oxidation to produce pheomelanin, followed finally by the production of eumelanin. based on these data, a casing model of mixed melanogenesis is proposed in which a preformed pheomelanic core is covered by a eumelanic surface.
higher education dominance and siloed knowledge: a systematic review of flipped classroom research recent calls for educational reform highlight ongoing concerns about the ability of current curricula to equip aspiring health care professionals with the skills for success. whereas a wide range of proposed solutions attempt to address apparent deficiencies in current educational models, a growing body of literature consistently points to the need to rethink the traditional in-class, lecture-based course model. one such proposal is the flipped classroom, in which content is offloaded for students to learn on their own, and class time is dedicated to engaging students in student-centered learning activities, like problem-based learning and inquiry-oriented strategies. in 2012, the authors flipped a required first-year pharmaceutics course at the university of north carolina eshelman school of pharmacy. they offloaded all lectures to self-paced online videos and used class time to engage students in active learning exercises. in this article, the authors describe the philosophy and methodology used to redesign the basic pharmaceutics ii course and outline the research they conducted to investigate the resulting outcomes. this article is intended to serve as a guide to instructors and educational programs seeking to develop, implement, and evaluate innovative and practical strategies to transform students’ learning experience. as class attendance, students’ learning, and the perceived value of this model all increased following participation in the flipped classroom, the authors conclude that this approach warrants careful consideration as educators aim to enhance learning, improve outcomes, and fully equip students to address 21st-century health care needs.
one-anastomosis gastric bypass versus sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity: a systematic review and meta-analysis background: results of the laparoscopic mini-gastric bypass (mgb) are reported. methods: 1,274 mgb patients are continuously monitored as part of an online computer tracking data-base system. results: mean preoperative weight (± standard deviation) was 132 ± 21 kg, bmi 47 ± 7. mean excess weight loss was 51% at 6 months, 68% at 12 months and 77% at 2 years. the mean operating-time was 36.9 ± 33.5 minutes. the shortest time was 19 minutes. hospital stay was 1.5 ± 1.6 days. the overall complication rate has been 5.2%.the overall rate of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism was 0.08% and 0.16% respectively. the leak rate was 1.6%. there was one hospital death, 0.08%. associated medical illnesses were either completely reversed or markedly improved. conclusions: the mgb is safe, results in major weight loss, has a short operating-time, and has a short hospital stay.the mgb appears to meet many of the criteria of an "ideal" weight loss operation.
in praise of impredicativity: a contribution to the formalisation of meta-programming we describe a fragment of higher-order horn logic which can be used as a higher-order extension of prolog. it allows the programmer to axiomatize predicates of predicates and operations on predicates. the restrictions defining the fragment ensure that the higher-order predicates and operations defined are monotonic and continuous—that they are enumeration operators. as a result, the fragment is well behaved both denotationally and operationally. denotationally, the meaning of a program is its minimal herbrand model, using standard extensional higher-order model theory. operationally, it can still be implemented efficiently with standard techniques, using an adapted resolution theorem prover. the fragment is in fact (almost) a subset of hilog—a “pure” subset with simple semantics and a straightforward implementation.
using constraint satisfaction problem approach to solve human resource allocation problems in cooperative health services hospital management is a hard task due to the complexity of the organization, the costly infrastructure, the specialized services offered to different patients and the need for prompt reaction to emergencies. artificial intelligence planning and scheduling methods can offer substantial support to the management of hospitals, and help raising the standards of service. this editorial presents an overview of the achievements reported in therapy planning and hospital management together with a general roadmap of the published research in artificial intelligence planning and scheduling. finally, a discussion for the future research and development in this area concludes the presentation.
the role of nuclear receptor nhr-64 in fat storage regulation in caenorhabditis elegans the nuclear receptor superfamily is comprised of over 150 different proteins that have evolved to mediate a complex array of extracellular signals into transcriptional responses. many, but not all, of these proteins directly bind to signaling molecules, which, because of their small lipophilic character, can easily enter the target cell. thus, unlike membrane-bound receptors, the nuclear receptors are intracellular and function to control the activity of target genes directly. in aggregate, these target genes comprise a genetic network whose coordinate activity defines the physiologic response. the purpose of this review is to establish the historical links between the steroid and nonsteroid receptor signaling systems, to chart the explosive development of the retinoid x receptor (rxr) heterodimer and orphan receptor family, to explain the impact of these discoveries on our understanding of the mechanisms of hormonal signaling, and, finally, to present emerging issues and implications of these studies for animal development, physiology, and human disease.
the six metal binding domains in human copper transporter, atp7b: molecular biophysics and disease-causing mutations backgroundwilson﻿'s disease ﻿with﻿ osseomuscular type is a rare condition, which often lacks typical hepatic and neurological symptoms and causes misdiagnoses easily. during the past 10 years, eight chinese patients of osseomuscular type of wilson's disease were identified in our clinic.methodsclinical information was gathered from medical records and follow-ups. the genetic testing was performed in each patient. serum ceruloplasmin, kayser-fleischer rings, liver function, brain magnetic resonance imaging and abdominal ultrasonography were also evaluated.resultsthe median age of onset is 12 years of age. the patients had their initial musculoskeletal conditions with arthralgia or joint deformity, while the hepatic or neurologic signs were minimal. most patients (6/8) eventually developed clinical neurological symptoms afterwards with a median interval of 36 months. all of them had normal liver function and low serum ceruloplasmin (<0.1 g/l). most patients (6/8) present with kayser-fleischer rings and abnormal hepatic ultrasonography. the arthralgia was resolved with copper chelation therapy.conclusionswilson’s disease with osseomuscular type occurs without typical hepatic or neurological symptoms, which makes the clinical diagnosis challenging. serum ceruloplasmin, abdominal ultrasonography, ophthalmic examination and genetic testing help to establish the diagnosis. early diagnosis can initiate an effective treatment and prevent the further damage.
scp160p is required for translational efficiency of codon-optimized mrnas in yeast the yeast spindle pole body (spb), the functional equivalent of mammalian centrosome, duplicates in g1/s phase of the cell cycle and then becomes inserted into the nuclear envelope. here we describe a link between spb duplication and targeted translation control. when insertion of the newly formed spb into the nuclear envelope fails, the sesa network comprising the gyf domain protein smy2, the translation inhibitor eap1, the mrna-binding protein scp160 and the asc1 protein, specifically inhibits initiation of translation of pom34 mrna that encodes an integral membrane protein of the nuclear pore complex, while having no impact on other mrnas. in response to sesa, pom34 mrna accumulates in the cytoplasm and is not targeted to the er for cotranslational translocation of the protein. reduced level of pom34 is sufficient to restore viability of mutants with defects in spb duplication. we suggest that the sesa network provides a mechanism by which cells can regulate the translation of specific mrnas. this regulation is used to coordinate competing events in the nuclear envelope.
greedy routing with anti-void traversal for wireless sensor networks suppose that a traveler arrives to the city of toronto, and wants to walk to the famous cn-tower, one of the tallest free-standing structures in the world. assume now that our visitor, lacking a map of toronto, is standing at a crossing from which he can see the cn-tower, and several streets s1, . . . , sm that he can choose to start his walk. a natural (and most likely safe assumption), is that our visitor must choose to walk first along the road that points closest in the direction of the cn-tower, see figure 1. a close look at maps of numerous cities around the world, show us that the previous way to explore a new, and unknown city will in general yield walks that will be close enough to the optimal ones to travel from one location to another. in mathematical terms, we can model the map of many cities by geometric graphs in which street intersections are represented by the vertices of our graphs, and streets by straight line segments. compass routing on geometric networks, in its most elemental form yields the following algorithm:
the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders in west pomeranian and pomeranian regions of poland summarybasing case selection on behavioural criteria, the entire 8–10 year old population of the county of middlesex was screened to identify children with autistic behaviour. screening was accomplished by behaviour questionnaires, completed by teachers or other supervisors, examination of case records and interviews with selected children and informants. among 54 children who were found to show some evidence of the syndrome, two “autistic” subgroups and one “non-autistic” subgroup were defined, according to ratings on 24 behavioural items. the 35 “autistic” cases represent a prevalence rate of 4.5 per 10,000. data for 32 of these were analyzed. boys were more common than girls in a ratio of 2.6 to 1. the relationship between early development, type of onset and i.q. at the survey mean age of 9 years 9 months, is discussed. the numbers of autistic children found are compared with those of children with other handicaps such as blindness. it is pointed out that sub-division according to the presence of developmental retardation is necessary for the useful comparison of reported groups, particularly with respect to estimates of prognosis.résuméen choisissant les cas selon des critères de comportement, toute la population âgée de 8–10 ans dans le comté du middlesex fut soigneusement examinée, afin d'identifier les enfants présentant un comportement, autiste. l'examen consista en questionnaires de comportement, complétés par les maîtres ou autres surveillants, l'examen des dossiers et des entretiens avec les enfants sélectionnés et les rapporteurs. parmi les 54 enfants chez qui l'on releva quelque évidence du syndrome, 2 sous-groupes »autistes« et un sous-groupe »non-autiste« furent définis, d'après les résultats de 24 items des tests de compontement. les 35 cas »autistes« représentent une proportion de 4,5 pour 10 000. les données concernant 32 de ces cas ont été analysées. il y avait plus de garçons que de filles dans le rapport de 2,6 pour 1. les relations entre le développement antérieur, le genre de l'affection actuelle et le q.i. à l'âge moyen lors de l'examen (9 ans 9 mois) sont discutées. le nombre d'enfants autistes trouvé est comparé au nombre d'enfants présentant d'autres handicaps, comme la cécité. on souligne, en ce qui concerne le retard du développement, la nécessité de faire des subdivisions, afin de pouvoir comparer utilement les groupes étudiés, en particulier quant aux estimations pronostiques.zusammenfassungvermittels einer fall-suche nach verhaltens-kriterien wurde die altersgruppe 8–10 jahre der population von middlesex durchgegangen, um kinder mit autistischem verhalten festzustellen. die einordnung erfolgte mit verhaltens-fragebögen (ausgefüllt durch lehrer oder andere erziehungspersonen), durch überprüfung von fall-geschichten und interviews mit ausgewählten kindern und sonstigen informanten. unter 54 kindern mit hinweisen auf ein autistisches syndrom konnten 2 „autistische“ untergruppen und eine „nichtautistische“ untergruppe gebildet werden, wenn die werte von 24 verhaltenskriterien zugrunde gelegt wurden. die 35 „autistischen“ fälle ergeben eine prävalenz-rate von 4,5 auf 10 000. die daten von 32 dieser fälle werden näher analysiert. jungen waren häufiger betroffen als mädchen, und zwar in einem verhältnis von 2,6∶1. die beziehung zwischen frühentwicklung, beginn des syndroms und i.q. wird diskutiert, vor allem im blick auf das mittlere alter der population zur zeit der untersuchung: 9 jahre, 9 monate. die zahlenwerte für autistische kinder werden mit solchen anderer gruppen geschädigter kinder (etwa blindheit) verglichen. eine unterteilung je nach vorhandensein eines entwicklungsrückstandes erscheint für einen fruchtbaren vergleich der berichteten gruppen und für prognostische schätzungen notwendig.
psychosocial correlates of depression in children and adolescents with epilepsy in a nigeria neuro-psychiatric hospital patients with epilepsy are at high risk for depression because of an incompletely understood combination of factors that may be both psychosocial and neurological. interictal depression in patients with epilepsy is an undertreated condition, in part because of concern regarding drug interactions and the risk of exacerbating seizures with antidepressant treatment. bipolar disorder is not described as occurring with a higher than expected frequency in the population with epilepsy, but high rates of depression and suicide are well recognised, highlighting the need for more emphasis on antidepressive treatment in this group of at-risk patients.neurological factors, including site and lateralisation of seizure focus, may be important for the development of depression, with left-sided seizure foci having a higher association with depressive symptoms. forced normalisation may be a factor in the paradoxical onset of depression in patients with epilepsy whose seizures suddenly become well controlled by anti-seizure treatment. lowering of folic acid levels by some antiepileptic drugs (aeds) may also influence the expression of depression in patients with epilepsy.new aeds continue to emerge as beneficial treatments themselves for mood disorders, with lamotrigine, gabapentin and, to a lesser extent, topiramate having clinical trials data to support their use in patients with bipolar disease. similar positive data are available for vagal nerve stimulation. mood effects of aeds can be complicated, however, as many of these drugs (e.g. tiagabine) have also been reported to cause depression as an adverse effect. electroconvulsive therapy in depressed patients with epilepsy requires special consideration.the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) and antidepressants that act at multiple receptors (e.g. nefazodone, venlafaxine) are the most appropriate treatments for depressed patients with epilepsy. among these agents, citalopram has a low risk of interactions with aeds. bupropion, clomipramine and maprotiline are associated with a greater risk of seizures compared with other antidepressants and consequently should be used with caution in the treatment of depression in patients with epilepsy.
protective and defensive airway reflexes evoked by nasal exposure to wood smoke in anesthetized rats. spontaneous inhalation of wood smoke (approximately 6 ml) via tracheostomy immediately evoked either a slowing of respiration (sr) or an augmented inspiration (ai) in each of the 76 anesthetized sprague-dawley rats studied. the sr was abolished after perineural capsaicin treatment of both cervical vagi (pct; n = 20) but persisted during cooling of both vagi to 6.7 degrees c (vgc, n = 12); pct selectively blocked the conduction of unmyelinated c fibers, whereas vgc differentially blocked the conduction of myelinated fibers. in contrast, the ai was eliminated during vgc (n = 10) but was unaffected by pct (n = 5). furthermore, after the sr was abolished in rats with pct, an ai became the dominant immediate response to inhaled wood smoke. conversely, after the ai was eliminated in rats receiving vgc, a sr was instantly evoked by inhaled wood smoke. removal of smoke particulates did not affect the sr (n = 17) but did prevent the ai in 5 of the 12 rats studied. these results suggest the following: 1) the sr is a reflex resulting from stimulation of bronchopulmonary c-fiber nerve endings by the gas-phase smoke; 2) the ai results from excitation of lung irritant receptors by the gas-phase and/or smoke particulates; and 3) in intact animals, both types of vagal bronchopulmonary afferents are probably activated by inhaled wood smoke.
effect of cocaine on ion channels and glutamatergic epscs in noradrenergic locus coeruleus neurons although cocaine binds to several sites in the brain, the biochemical receptor mechanism or mechanisms associated with its dependence producing properties are unknown. it is shown here that the potencies of cocaine-like drugs in self-administration studies correlate with their potencies in inhibiting [3h]mazindol binding to the dopamine transporters in the rat striatum, but not with their potencies in binding to a large number of other presynaptic and postsynaptic binding sites. thus, the cocaine receptor related to substance abuse is proposed to be the one associated with dopamine uptake inhibition.
subliminal speech perception and auditory streaming this introductory chapter attempts to clarify the philosophical, empirical, and theoretical bases on which a cognitive neuroscience approach to consciousness can be founded. we isolate three major empirical observations that any theory of consciousness should incorporate, namely (1) a considerable amount of processing is possible without consciousness, (2) attention is a prerequisite of consciousness, and (3) consciousness is required for some specific cognitive tasks, including those that require durable information maintenance, novel combinations of operations, or the spontaneous generation of intentional behavior. we then propose a theoretical framework that synthesizes those facts: the hypothesis of a global neuronal workspace. this framework postulates that, at any given time, many modular cerebral networks are active in parallel and process information in an unconscious manner. an information becomes conscious, however, if the neural population that represents it is mobilized by top-down attentional amplification into a brain-scale state of coherent activity that involves many neurons distributed throughout the brain. the long-distance connectivity of these 'workspace neurons' can, when they are active for a minimal duration, make the information available to a variety of processes including perceptual categorization, long-term memorization, evaluation, and intentional action. we postulate that this global availability of information through the workspace is what we subjectively experience as a conscious state. a complete theory of consciousness should explain why some cognitive and cerebral representations can be permanently or temporarily inaccessible to consciousness, what is the range of possible conscious contents, how they map onto specific cerebral circuits, and whether a generic neuronal mechanism underlies all of them. we confront the workspace model with those issues and identify novel experimental predictions. neurophysiological, anatomical, and brain-imaging data strongly argue for a major role of prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and the areas that connect to them, in creating the postulated brain-scale workspace.
noradrenergic content and turnover rate in kidney and heart shows gender and strain differences. a method of measuring the rate of synthesis of catecholamines in various tissues takes advantage of the steady state relationship in which the rate of catecholamine formation is equal to the rate of efflux. after tyrosine hydroxylase is blocked with α-methyltyrosine, the brain levels of norepinephrine (ne) and dopamine and the ne levels in various peripheral tissues of rats and rabbits decline exponentially. the rate of synthesis of the catecholamines is calculated from the product of the rate constant of amine decline and the normal catecholamine level. the value for heart ne yielded by this method is almost identical with that obtained from the decline in radioactivity after labeling with dl -h3-ne. the application of this method to studies in the rat shows that the turnover time for ne in heart, salivary gland and iris is about 12 hr, compared to 6 hr for brain ne, 3 hr for brain dopamine and 2 hr for ne in the cervical sympathetic ganglia. in the rabbit hypothalamus, ne is formed five times more rapidly than in the midbrain, though the turnover times are almost identical. this suggests that the rate of synthesis might be similar in each adrenergic unit and that variations in rates of synthesis in different brain areas are a function of the number of neurons per gram of tissue.
assessing biodiversity integrity for the conservation of grazed and burnt grassland systems: avian field metabolic rates as a rapid assessment tool in this study, we investigated the responses of two faunal groups, birds and arthropods, to varying degrees of disturbance caused by fire and grazing in south africa, eight study sites of varying fire frequency and stocking density were studied over two summer seasons (october–march). bird assemblages reflected habitat disturbance in a diversity of ways, driven by factors ranging from direct disturbance to changes in habitat structure and functioning, and shifts in food availability. similarly, arthropod diversity and abundance changed seasonally in response to management practices. fire frequency drives faunal assemblage structure and abundance and, in most cases, overrides the effects of grazing at all taxonomic levels. in particular, fire frequency strongly influenced grassland-breeding birds because farms are burnt in the territory-forming stage of the breeding cycle. insectivores and nectarivores were disproportionately impacted by intensive commercial management. of particular concern in this system is the yellow-breasted pipit (anthus chloris), which is regionally and globally vulnerable because of habitat loss. this species is sensitive to any form of habitat disturbance, highlighting the need for conservation attention in these grasslands. of the ten arthropod orders present in the study area, only orthoptera responded positively to burning. however, orthopterans made up on average 78% of arthropod biomass in moist highland grasslands, resulting in high grasshopper biomass on annually burnt farms: this high biomass in turn supports an abundance of insectivores. this reinforces the importance of process-oriented data where a measure of performance, such as reproductive success, is considered in assessing ecosystem condition.
does co-morbidity provide significant improvement on age adjustment when predicting medical outcomes? objective to assess the associations of smoking, body weight, and physical activity with risk of undergoing total joint replacement (tjr) in a population-based cohort of men.   methods a cohort study of 11,388 men that integrated clinical data with hospital morbidity data and mortality records was undertaken. the risk of undergoing tjr was modeled on baseline weight, height, comorbidity, socioeconomic status, years of smoking, and exercise in 3 separate age groups, using cox proportional hazards regressions and competing risk regressions (crrs).   results dose-response relationships between weight and risk of tjr and between smoking and risk of tjr were observed. being overweight independently increased the risk of tjr, while smoking lowered the risk. the decreased risk among smokers was demonstrated in both cox and crr models and became apparent after 23 years of exposure. men who were in the highest quartile (≥48 years of smoking) were 42-51% less likely to undergo tjr than men who had never smoked. tests for trend in the log hazard ratios (hrs) across both smoking and weight quantiles yielded significant p values. vigorous exercise increased the hazard of tjr; however, the association reached statistical significance only in the 70-74-year-old age group (adjusted hr 1.64 [95% confidence interval 1.19-2.24]). adjusting for deyo-charlson index or elixhauser's comorbidity measures did not eliminate these associations.   conclusion our findings indicate that being overweight and reporting vigorous physical activity increase the risk of tjr. this study is the first to demonstrate a strong inverse dose-response relationship between duration of smoking and risk of tjr. more research is needed to better understand the role of smoking in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis.
systematic screening reveals a role for brca1 in the response to transcription-associated dna damage. cullin 4 (cul4)‐based ubiquitin ligases emerged as critical regulators of dna replication and repair. over 50 cul4‐specific adaptors (dna damage‐binding 1 (ddb1)–cul4‐associated factors; dcafs) have been identified and are thought to assemble functionally distinct cul4 complexes. using a live‐cell imaging‐based rnai screen, we analysed the function of dcafs and cul4‐linked proteins, and identified specific subsets required for progression through g1 and s phase. we discovered c6orf167/mms22‐like protein (mms22l) as a putative human orthologue of budding yeast mms22, which, together with cullin rtt101, regulates genome stability by promoting dna replication through natural pause sites and damaged templates. loss of mms22l function in human cells results in s phase‐dependent genomic instability characterised by spontaneous double‐strand breaks and dna damage checkpoint activation. unlike yeast mms22, human mms22l does not stably bind to cul4, but is degraded in a cul4‐dependent manner and upon replication stress. mms22l physically and functionally interacts with the scaffold‐like protein nfkbil2 that co‐purifies with histones, several chromatin remodelling and dna replication/repair factors. together, our results strongly suggest that the mms22l–nfkbil2 complex contributes to genome stability by regulating the chromatin state at stalled replication forks.
easy and efficient protocol for oomycete dna extraction suitable for population genetic analysis backgroundmicrosatellites or single sequence repeats (ssrs) are a powerful choice of marker in the study of phytophthora population biology, epidemiology, ecology, genetics and evolution. a strategy was tested in which the publicly available unigene datasets extracted from genome sequences of p. infestans, p. sojae and p. ramorum were mined for candidate ssr markers that could be applied to a wide range of phytophthora species.resultsa first approach, aimed at the identification of polymorphic ssr loci common to many phytophthora species, yielded 171 reliable sequences containing 211 ssrs. microsatellites were identified from 16 target species representing the breadth of diversity across the genus. repeat number ranged from 3 to 16 with most having seven repeats or less and four being the most commonly found. trinucleotide repeats such as (aag)n, (agg)n and (agc)n were the most common followed by pentanucleotide, tetranucleotide and dinucleotide repeats. a second approach was aimed at the identification of useful loci common to a restricted number of species more closely related to p. sojae (p. alni, p. cambivora, p. europaea and p. fragariae). this analysis yielded 10 trinucleotide and 2 tetranucleotide ssrs which were repeated 4, 5 or 6 times.conclusionkey studies on inter- and intra-specific variation of selected microsatellites remain. despite the screening of conserved gene coding regions, the sequence diversity between species was high and the identification of useful ssr loci applicable to anything other than the most closely related pairs of phytophthora species was challenging. that said, many novel ssr loci for species other than the three 'source species' (p. infestans, p. sojae and p. ramorum) are reported, offering great potential for the investigation of phytophthora populations. in addition to the presence of microsatellites, many of the amplified regions may represent useful molecular marker regions for other studies as they are highly variable and easily amplifiable from different phytophthora species.
testing mendelian inheritance from field-collected parasites: revealing duplicated loci enables correct inference of reproductive mode and mating system. abstract.reproduction is essential to all organisms if they are to contribute to the next generation. there are various means and ways of achieving this goal. this review focuses on the role of asexual reproduction for eukaryotic organisms and how its integration in a life cycle can influence their population genetics and evolution. an important question for evolutionary biologists as to why some organisms reproduce sexually, as opposed to asexually, is addressed. we also discuss the economic and medical importance of asexual organisms.
pkcη regulates the tgfβ3-induced chondevrepogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cell protein kinase c eta (pkceta) is one of several pkc isoforms found in humans. it is a novel pkc isoform in that it is activated by diacylglycerol and anionic phospholipids but not calcium. the crystal structure of the pkceta-c2 domain, which is thought to mediate anionic phospholipid sensing in the protein, was determined at 1.75 a resolution. the structure is similar to that of the pkc epsilon c2 domain but with significant variations at the putative lipid-binding site. two serine residues within pkc eta were identified in vitro as potential autophosphorylation sites. in the unphosphorylated structure both serines line the putative lipid-binding site and may therefore play a role in the lipid-regulation of the kinase.

endoscopic management of antrochoanal polyps: a single uk centre’s experience antrochoanal polyps (acp) are benign lesions that arise from the mucosa of the maxillary sinus, grow into the maxillary sinus and reach the choana, and nasal obstruction being their main symptom. it is an interesting model to compare the pathophysiological mechanisms with those of bilateral nasal polyposis (np). there is a lack of research in some areas of acp, which have to become the main aims for future investigations of this disease. in comparison to np, acps are usually unilateral and appear in younger patients. macroscopically, they have a cystic intramaxillary portion and a solid intranasal portion. microscopically, they are similar to a maxillary cyst of the mucosa. nasal endoscopy, computed tomography and magnetic resonance are the main diagnostic techniques. surgery is the indicated treatment for acp, with endoscopic resection the most recommended. simple avulsion of the polyp has a high rate of recurrence, whereas the caldwell-luc procedure is associated with damage of the maxillary and dental growth centres. more research is needed to establish the relationship between chronic sinusitis and acp. further work is also needed to investigate the role of inflammatory mediators (histamine, ige, adhesion molecules, paf), as well as metalloproteases and nasal remodelling, and tumour marker expression in a cp.
a cut-based heuristic to produce almost feasible periodic railway timetables during the last 15 years, many solution methods for the important task of constructing periodic timetables for public transportation companies have been proposed. we first point out the importance of an objective function, where we observe that in particular a linear objective function turns out to be a good compromise between essential practical requirements and computational tractability. then, we enter into a detailed empirical analysis of various mixed integer programming (mip) procedures — those using node variables and those using arc variables — genetic algorithms, simulated annealing and constraint programming. to our knowledge, this is the first comparison of five conceptually different solution approaches for periodic timetable optimization.
expression of foreign type i ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/ oxygenase (ec 4.1.1.39) stimulates photosynthesis in cyanobacterium synechococcus pcc7942 cells changes in gas-exchange rates during the life span of the leaves of rice (oryza sativa l.) were analyzed quantitatively by measuring changes in the carboxylation/oxygenation and regeneration of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (rubp) at photon fluence rates of 2000 (saturating) and 500 (subsaturating) μmol quanta·m-2·s-1 under ambient air conditions. the rubp levels were always higher than the active-site concentrations of rubp carboxylase (ec 4.1.1.39), irrespective of the irradiance supplied. analysis of the co2-assimilation rate as a function of intercellular co2 concentration indicated that rubp regeneration does not limit co2 assimilation. the estimated rubp-carboxylase/oxygenase activity in vivo was linearly correlated to the rate of co2 assimilation at each level of irradiance. this enzyme activity was just enough to account for the rate of co2 assimilation at the saturating irradiance and was 35% more than the rate of co2 assimilation at the subsaturating irradiance. analysis of the assimilation rate at subsaturating irradiance as a function of intercellular co2 concentration indicated that a limitation caused by enzyme activation comes into play. the results indicate that the rate of co2 assimilation in rice leaves under ambient air conditions is limited during their entire life span by the rubp-carboxylation/oxygenation capacity.
neuronal functions, feeding behavior and energy balance in slc2a3+/- mice glut-1 deficiency syndrome (glut-1 ds, omim #606777) is characterized by infantile seizures, developmental delay, acquired microcephaly and hypoglycorrhachia. it is caused by haploinsufficiency of the blood-brain barrier hexose carrier. heterozygous mutations or hemizygosity of the glut-1 gene cause glut-1 ds. we generated a heterozygous haploinsufficient mouse model by targeted disruption of the promoter and exon 1 regions of the mouse glut-1 gene. glut-1+/- mice have epileptiform discharges on electroencephalography (eeg), impaired motor activity, incoordination, hypoglycorrhachia, microencephaly, decreased brain glucose uptake as measured by positron emission tomography (pet) scan and decreased brain glut-1 expression by western blot (66%). the glut-1+/- murine phenotype mimics the classical human presentation of glut-1 ds. this glut-1+/- mouse model creates an opportunity to investigate glut-1 function, to examine the pathophysiology of glut-1 ds in vivo and to evaluate new treatment strategies.
improving availability applying intelligent replication in federated cloud storage based on log analysis with the increasing utilization and popularity of the cloud infrastructure, more and more data are moved to the cloud storage systems. this makes the availability of cloud storage services critically important, particularly given the fact that outages of cloud storage services have indeed happened from time to time. thus, solely depending on a single cloud storage provider for storage services can risk violating the service-level agreement (sla) due to the weakening of service availability. this has led to the notion of cloud-of-clouds, where data redundancy is introduced to distribute data among multiple independent cloud storage providers, to address the problem. the key in the effectiveness of the cloud-of-clouds approaches lies in how the data redundancy is incorporated and distributed among the clouds. however, the existing cloud-of-clouds approaches utilize either replication or erasure codes to redundantly distribute data across multiple clouds, thus incurring either high space or high performance overheads. in this paper, we propose a hybrid redundant data distribution approach, called hyrd, to improve the cloud storage availability in cloud-of-clouds by exploiting the workload characteristics and the diversity of cloud providers. in hyrd, large files are distributed in multiple cost-efficient cloud storage providers with erasure-coded data redundancy while small files and file system metadata are replicated on multiple high-performance cloud storage providers. the experiments conducted on our lightweight prototype implementation of hyrd show that hyrd improves the cost efficiency by 33.4% and 20.4%, and reduces the access latency by 58.7% and 34.8% than the duracloud and racs schemes, respectively.
overexpression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16 is associated with tumor recurrence in human prostate cancer. the cell cycle‐associated retinoblastoma protein (prb) and p16 protein were demonstrated using immuno‐histochemistry on paraffin sections from 192 cases of invasive breast carcinoma. abnormal expression of prb was defined as negative staining and was seen in 17% of tumours. such abnormal expression was significantly more frequent in tumours with negative oestrogen receptor (er) status. there was also a trend for tumours which were negative for prb to be grade iii ductal carcinomas. there was no association between p16 staining and any histopathological parameter, though, surprisingly, log‐rank analysis showed that strong staining was associated with a poor outcome. there was a significant inverse relationship between prb and p16 expression and a significant positive association between prb and cyclin d1. in a cox multivariate analysis, which included cyclin d1, neither prb nor p16 was an independent predictor of patient outcome. int. j. cancer (pred. oncol.) 79:71–75, 1998. © 1998 wiley‐liss, inc.
possible involvement of the m2 anti‐inflammatory macrophage phenotype in growth of human gliomas interleukin 10 (il‐10) expression has been found to be correlated with the extent of malignancy in gliomas. in vitro, il‐10 increases proliferation and migratory capacity in human glioma cell lines. in this study, we localized the site of il‐10 synthesis in gliomas to cells of microglial origin. biopsy specimens from 11 patients with malignant glioma were processed on native tissues and at early cell culture passages (0–4). il‐10 mrna was analyzed by rt‐pcr and in situ hybridization. protein was quantitatively assessed by elisa in cell culture supernatants, and cells expressing il‐10 were determined by a combination of immunohistochemistry for cd68 (specific for microglia/macrophage lineage) and il‐10 in situ hybridization. il‐10 mrna decreased from passage 0 to 4 in all samples and was undetectable beyond passage 5. such downregulation of mrna leads to a steep decrease of il‐10 protein in culture supernatants (below detection level, 0.05 ng/ml, beyond passage 1). the combination of in situ hybridization for il‐10 and cd68 immunostaining revealed that only cells of the microglia/macrophage lineage produced il‐10 mrna. our results identify microglia/macrophage cells as the major source of il‐10 expression in gliomas which decreases markedly during early passages of primary cultures of human gliomas due to a progressive reduction of microglia/macrophages present. int. j. cancer 82:12–16, 1999. © 1999 wiley‐liss, inc.
0 time-varying discrete-time wavelet transforms time-varying filter banks and wavelets are studied and a design procedure is presented. in the resulting analysis-synthesis structures, the analysis filters and the corresponding synthesis filters, the number of bands, and the decimation rates can be changed with time. such structures can be considered as time-frequency overlapping block transforms. from this viewpoint, the tiling of the time-frequency plane and the corresponding basis functions are changed in time. the time-varying discrete wavelet transforms can be considered a special case of time-varying overlapping block transforms and are studied in detail. the formulation is based on the time domain formulation of time-varying analysis-synthesis structures. the design procedure can be used to design time-varying perfectly invertible transformations with a finite number of distinct analysis structures. for adaptive filter bank application, a least squares design method is also studied. >
an algorithm for protein helix assignment using helix geometry motivation: secondary structure underpins the folding pattern and architecture of most proteins. accurate assignment of the secondary structure elements is therefore an important problem. although many approximate solutions of the secondary structure assignment problem exist, the statement of the problem has resisted a consistent and mathematically rigorous definition. a variety of comparative studies have highlighted major disagreements in the way the available methods define and assign secondary structure to coordinate data. results: we report a new method to infer secondary structure based on the bayesian method of minimum message length inference. it treats assignments of secondary structure as hypotheses that explain the given coordinate data. the method seeks to maximize the joint probability of a hypothesis and the data. there is a natural null hypothesis and any assignment that cannot better it is unacceptable. we developed a program sst based on this approach and compared it with popular programs, such as dssp and stride among others. our evaluation suggests that sst gives reliable assignments even on low-resolution structures. availability: http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~karun/sst contact: arun.konagurthu@monash.edu (or lloyd.allison@monash.edu)
climatic forcing on channel profiles in the eastern cordillera of the coroico region, bolivia the bolivian andes flank one of earth’s major topographic features and dominate sediment input into the amazon basin. millennial-scale erosion rates and dominant controls on erosion patterns in this range are poorly known. to define these patterns, we present 48 erosion rate estimates, derived from analysis of in situ 10 be in quartz-bearing alluvium collected from the upper beni river basin. erosion rates, corrected for the non-uniform distribution of quartz in the sample basins, range from 0·04 mm a −1 to 1·35 mm a −1 and thus integrate over 10 2 ‐10 4 years. mean and modal values are 0·42 (standard deviation: 0·29) and 0·2‐0·4 mm a −1 respectively, within the range of long-term average erosion rates in this area derived from apatite fission track thermochronology (0·1‐0·6 mm a −1 ). hence, our data do not record any significant variation in erosion rate over the last several million years. mean and modal short-term erosion rates for the andes are an order of magnitude lower than rates in the ganges river headwaters in the high himalaya and an order of magnitude greater than rates typical of the european alps. in the upper beni river region of the bolivian andes, short-term, basin-averaged erosion rates correlate with normalized channel steepness index, a metric of relative channel gradient corrected for drainage area. neither normalized channel steepness index nor basin-averaged erosion rate shows strong correlation with mean basin hillslope gradient or mean basin local relief because many hillslopes in the upper beni river region are at threshold values of slope and local relief. patterns of normalized channel steepness index appear primarily to reflect tectonic patterns and transient adjustment to those patterns by channel networks. climate and lithology do not appear to exert first-order controls on patterns of basin-averaged erosion rates in the bolivian andes. copyright © 2005 john wiley & sons, ltd.
the mechanism of decrease in dynamic mitral regurgitation during heart failure treatment: importance of reduction in the regurgitant orifice size. the proximal flow convergence method, a quantitative color doppler flow technique, has been validated recently for calculating regurgitant flow and orifice area. we investigated the potential of the method as a tool to study different pathophysiological mechanisms of mitral valve incompetence by assessing the time course of regurgitant flow and orifice area and analyzed the implications for quantification of mitral regurgitation. methods and resultsfifty-six consecutive patients with mitral regurgitation of different etiologies were studied. the instantaneous regurgitant flow rate q(t) was computed from color m-mode recordings of the proximal flow convergence region and divided by the corresponding orifice velocity v(t) to obtain the instantaneous orifice area at). regurgitant stroke volume (rsv) was obtained by integrating q(t). mean regurgitant flow rate qm was calculated by rsv divided by regurgitation time. peak-to-mean regurgitant flow rates qp/qm and orifice areas a(p)/am were calculated to assess the phasic character of qt)and a(t). in the first 24 patients (group 1), computation of qm and rsv from the color doppler recordings was compared with the conventional pulsed doppler method (r = .94, see=29.4 ml/s and r = .95, see=9.7 ml) as well as with angiography (r,=.93 and r,=.94, p < .001). the temporal variation of q(t) and a(t) was studied in the next 32 patients (group 2): in functional regurgitation in dilated cardiomyopathy (n= 12), there was a constant decrease in at) throughout systole with an increase during left ventricular relaxation; ap/am was 5.49±3.17. in mitral valve prolapse n=6), a(t) was small in early systole, increasing substantially in midsystole, and decreasing mildly during left ventricular relaxation; ap/am was 2.48±0.26. in rheumatic mitral regurgitation n= 14), a roughly constant regurgitant orifice area during most of systole was found in 4 patients. in the other patients there was significant variation of ast) and the time of its maximum; ap/am was 1.81 ±0.56. anova demonstrated that the differences in ap/am were related to the etiology of mitral regurgitation (p < .0001). to verify that the calculated variation in regurgitant orifice area during the cardiac cycle reflects an actual variation, the ability of the method to predict a constant orifice area throughout systole was tested experimentally in a canine model of mitral regurgitation. five flow stages were produced by implanting fixed grommet orifices of different sizes into the anterior mitral leaflet. a constant regurgitant orifice area was correctly predicted throughout systole with a mean percent error of −1.8±4% (from −6.9% to ±5.8%); the standard deviation of the individual curves calculated at 10% intervals during systole averaged 13.3% (from 3.6% to 19.6%). in addition, functional mitral regurgitation caused by ventricular dysfunction was produced pharmacologically in five dogs, and the color m-mode recordings of the proximal flow convergence region were obtained with the transducer placed directly on the heart instead of the chest, thus ruling out a significant effect of translational motion on the observed flow pattern. the pattern of regurgitant flow variation was identical to that observed in patients. conclusionsthe proximal flow convergence method demonstrates that regurgitant flow and orifice area vary throughout systole in distinct patterns characteristic of the underlying mechanism of mitral incompetence. therefore, in addition to the potential of the method as a tool to quantify mitral regurgitation, it allows analysis of the pathophysiology of regurgitation in the individual patient, which may be helpful in clinical decision making. calculating mitral regurgitant flow rate and volume from the time-varying proximal flow field (ie, without assuming a constant orifice area that would produce overestimation in individual patients) provides excellent agreement with independent techniques and agrees well with angiography.
polymorphism of gliadins in aegilops tauschii coss. local populations in two primary habitats in dagestan the diploid goatgrass aegilopstauschii is considered the d-genome donor of bread wheat and has probably a centre of diversity in north of iran. in order to measure the genetic diversity of and the relationships among different populations, varieties and subspecies belonging to ae. tauschii in iran, dna was extracted from 48 accessions of ae. tauschii collected across the geographic range of the species in the country and the genetic diversity was assessed using aflps based on eight psti/msei +3 primer pairs resulted in 277 bands, 198 of which were polymorphic. high level polymorphism was detected, with an average of polymorphism rate of 0.715; relatively low genetic similarity (0.455) between accessions and significant difference between the lowest (0.179) and the highest genetic similarity (0.817). the iranian ae. tauschii populations showed high level of genetic diversity. the populations studied were divided into two groups: one group was mainly representing northern populations collected from southern caspian sea shore and the other group was mainly representing northeast and northwest populations. based on the results of this study, it can be suggested that ae. tauschii possesses two separate gene-pools in iran: northern and northeastern–northwestern. considering the needs for introducing new characteristics and alleles for wheat improvement purposes, ae. tauschii iranian gene-pool is assumed to be of high importance for more investigation in the future.
what we learned from the dust bowl: lessons in science, policy, and adaptation abstract coupled global circulation models (cgcms) have been widely used to explore potential future climate change. before these climate projections can be trusted, the ability of the models to simulate present-day climate must be assessed. this study evaluates the ability of three cgcms that participated in the fourth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change to simulate long-term drought over the great plains region with the same frequency and intensity as was observed during the twentieth century. the three models evaluated in this study are the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory coupled model, version 2.0 (cm2.0); the national centers for atmospheric research community climate system model, version 3 (ccsm3); and third climate configuration of the met office unified model (hadcm3). the models are shown to capture the broad features of the climatology of the great plains, with maximum precipitation occurring in early summer, as observed. however, all of the models overestim...
expression of cyp 11 b 2 in aldosterone-producing adrenocortical adenoma : regulatory mechanisms and clinical significance primary aldosteronism is the most prevalent form of secondary hypertension. to explore molecular mechanisms of autonomous aldosterone secretion, we performed exome sequencing of aldosterone-producing adenomas (apas). we identified somatic hotspot mutations in the atp1a1 (encoding an na+/k+ atpase α subunit) and atp2b3 (encoding a ca2+ atpase) genes in three and two of the nine apas, respectively. these atpases are expressed in adrenal cells and control sodium, potassium and calcium ion homeostasis. functional in vitro studies of atp1a1 mutants showed loss of pump activity and strongly reduced affinity for potassium. electrophysiological ex vivo studies on primary adrenal adenoma cells provided further evidence for inappropriate depolarization of cells with atpase alterations. in a collection of 308 apas, we found 16 (5.2%) somatic mutations in atp1a1 and 5 (1.6%) in atp2b3. mutation-positive cases showed male dominance, increased plasma aldosterone concentrations and lower potassium concentrations compared with mutation-negative cases. in summary, dominant somatic alterations in two members of the atpase gene family result in autonomous aldosterone secretion.

a cornerstone of healthy aging: do we need to rethink the concept of adherence in the elderly? background adherence to medication is vital for disease management while simultaneously reducing healthcare expenditure. older persons with cognitive impairment (ci) are at risk for non-adherence as cognitive processes are needed to manage medications. this systematic review focuses on the relationship between medication non-adherence and specific cognitive domains in persons with ci, and explores determinants of medication non-adherence. when available, relationships and factors are compared with cognitively intact populations. methods a seven database systematic search of studies published between 1 january 1949–31 december 2015 examining medication non-adherence in community dwelling persons with ci or dementia was conducted. articles reporting medication non-adherence in people with ci or dementia in the community, with or without caregiver supports were eligible for inclusion. papers reporting adherence to treatments in cognitively intact populations, populations from hospital or institutional settings, for non-prescribed medication or those describing dementia as a factor predicting medication non-adherence were excluded. data on study and population characteristics, research design, data sources and analysis, specific cognitive domains, non-adherence prevalence, measurement of adherence, salient findings, factors associated with adherence and strategies to improve medication adherence were extracted. study limitations included inconsistencies between data sources and definitions, resulting in a loss of fidelity in the value and comprehensiveness of data, as well as exclusion of non-pharmacological treatments and regimens. findings fifteen studies met inclusion criteria. adherence among ci subjects ranged from 10.7%-38% with better rates of adherence in non-ci individuals. medication non-adherence definitions varied considerably. new-learning, memory and executive functioning were associated with improved adherence and formed the focus of most studies. multiple factors were identified as modulators of non-adherence. conclusion this review highlights a gap in knowledge on how specific cognitive domains contribute to medication non-adherence amongst ci populations, and demonstrates the current focus is limited to two domains: memory and executive functioning.
automatic generation of test inputs for mercury we introduce mercury, a new purely declarative logic programming language designed to provide the support that groups of application programmers need when building large programs. mercury's strong type, mode, and determinism systems improve program reliability by catching many errors at compile time. we present a new and relatively simple execution model that takes advantage of the information these systems provide, yielding very efficient code. the mercury compiler uses this execution model to generate portable c code. our benchmarking shows that the code generated by our implementation is significantly faster than the code generated by mature optimizing implementations of other logic programming languages.
secure transmission and self-energy recycling with partial eavesdropper csi we consider a dual-hop full-duplex relaying system, where the energy constrained relay node is powered by radio frequency signals from the source using the time-switching architecture, both the amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward relaying protocols are studied. specifically, we provide an analytical characterization of the achievable throughput of three different communication modes, namely, instantaneous transmission, delay-constrained transmission, and delay tolerant transmission. in addition, the optimal time split is studied for different transmission modes. our results reveal that, when the time split is optimized, the full-duplex relaying could substantially boost the system throughput compared to the conventional half-duplex relaying architecture for all three transmission modes. in addition, it is shown that the instantaneous transmission mode attains the highest throughput. however, compared to the delay-constrained transmission mode, the throughput gap is rather small. unlike the instantaneous time split optimization which requires instantaneous channel state information, the optimal time split in the delay-constrained transmission mode depends only on the statistics of the channel, hence, is suitable for practical implementations.
comparison of clonidine and midazolam premedication before endoscopic sinus surgery: results of clinical trial the effects of clonidine, a centrally acting α2-adrenergic receptor agonist, on depth of fentanyl anesthesia and on cardiovascular response to laryngoscopy and intubation were studied. twenty-four patients undergoing aortocoronary bypass surgery (acbs) with a history of arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease (nyha class 3–4), and well-preserved left ventricular function were assigned randomly to either group 1 (n = 12), who received standard pre-medication, or group 2 (n = 12), who received clonidine 5 μ;g·kg-1 po in addition to standard premedication 90 min before estimated induction time. depth of anesthesia was assessed by on-line aperiodic computerized analysis of the electroencephalogram (lifescan eeg monitor®). fentanyl was administered in 250-μ;g increments to shift the eeg to the 0.5–3-hz frequency range (delta activity) in all subjects. in both groups, the anesthetic regimen effectively prevented hyperdynamic cardiovascular responses to laryngoscopy and intubation. no significant differences in measured or derived hemodynamic variables were observed between the two groups during the awake control period, except for stroke volume index (svi), which was significantly greater in group 1,44 ± 9 ml · beat-1 · m-2 compared with group 2, 35 ± 3.3 ml · beat-1 · m-2 (p < 0.05). by contrast, fentanyl requirements in group 2 were significantly reduced by 45% when compared with group 1, i.e., from 110 ± 23 to 61 ± 19 μ;g· kg-1(p < 0.001). the authors conclude that at a similar anesthetic depth, as assessed by the eeg shift into the lower frequency range (0.5–3 hz), a markedly reduced fentanyl dose effectively prevented the hyperdynamic cardiovascular response to laryngoscopy and intubation in the group of patients premedicated with clonidine. this is likely explained by the known synergistic inhibitory action of opiates and α2-adrenoceptor agonists on central sympathetic outflow.
prevalence of depression and its correlations: a cross-sectional study in thai cancer patients. increased survival rates resulting from advances in the treatment of cancer have led to an increased interest in patients' emotional reactions and adaptations to the illness. depressive symptoms associated with cancer range from normal sadness through acute stress response to major depression. chemotherapeutic agents can produce depressive and other neurotoxic side effects. diagnosis of common emotional reactions to cancer illness and appropriate management are described. such treatment can enhance the patient's ability to adapt to the disease and tolerate its treatments.
physical constraints on the evolution of cooperation a model is presented to account for the natural selection of what is termed reciprocally altruistic behavior. the model shows how selection can operate against the cheater (non-reciprocator) in the system. three instances of altruistic behavior are discussed, the evolution of which the model can explain: (1) behavior involved in cleaning symbioses; (2) warning cries in birds; and (3) human reciprocal altruism. regarding human reciprocal altruism, it is shown that the details of the psychological system that regulates this altruism can be explained by the model. specifically, friendship, dislike, moralistic aggression, gratitude, sympathy, trust, suspicion, trustworthiness, aspects of guilt, and some forms of dishonesty and hypocrisy can be explained as important adaptations to regulate the altruistic system. each individual human is seen as possessing altruistic and cheating tendencies, the expression of which is sensitive to developmental variables that were selected to set the tendencies at a balance appropriate to the local social and ecological environment.
the clinicopathological features of patients with membranous nephropathy background idiopathic membranous nephropathy, a common form of the nephrotic syndrome, is an antibody-mediated autoimmune glomerular disease. serologic diagnosis has been elusive because the target antigen is unknown.   methods we performed western blotting of protein extracts from normal human glomeruli with serum samples from patients with idiopathic or secondary membranous nephropathy or other proteinuric or autoimmune diseases and from normal controls. we used mass spectrometry to analyze the reactive protein bands and confirmed the identity and location of the target antigen with a monospecific antibody.   results serum samples from 26 of 37 patients (70%) with idiopathic but not secondary membranous nephropathy specifically identified a 185-kd glycoprotein in nonreduced glomerular extract. mass spectrometry of the reactive protein band detected the m-type phospholipase a(2) receptor (pla(2)r). reactive serum specimens recognized recombinant pla(2)r and bound the same 185-kd glomerular protein as did the monospecific anti-pla(2)r antibody. anti-pla(2)r autoantibodies in serum samples from patients with membranous nephropathy were mainly igg4, the predominant immunoglobulin subclass in glomerular deposits. pla(2)r was expressed in podocytes in normal human glomeruli and colocalized with igg4 in immune deposits in glomeruli of patients with membranous nephropathy. igg eluted from such deposits in patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy, but not in those with lupus membranous or iga nephropathy, recognized pla(2)r.   conclusions a majority of patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy have antibodies against a conformation-dependent epitope in pla(2)r. pla(2)r is present in normal podocytes and in immune deposits in patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy, indicating that pla(2)r is a major antigen in this disease.

mfge8 does not influence chorio-retinal homeostasis or choroidal neovascularization in vivo a 2.1-kilobase cdna coding for a surface protein of mammary epithelial cells has been isolated from a mouse mammary gland lambda gt11 cdna library. sequence analysis of this cdna reveals an open reading frame of 1389 base pairs that defines a protein with a molecular mass of 51.5 kda. structural analysis of the predicted sequence identifies two putative functional domains of the protein: (i) an n-terminal cysteine-rich region that is similar to epidermal growth factor-like domains of drosophila notch-1 protein and (ii) a large segment of the sequence that exhibited 54.5% identity with c-terminal domains of human coagulation factors viii and v. these similarities in structure are used to predict the possible functions of the protein and its means of interaction with the cell surface. mrna expression was detectable in mammary tissue from nonpregnant animals but was maximal in the lactating gland. in cultured cells, mrna levels also correlated with the degree of cellular differentiation.
are we ready for the eras protocol in colorectal surgery? enhanced recovery after surgery protocol in colorectal surgery allows shortening length of hospital stay and reducing complication rate. despite the clear guidelines and conclusive evidence their full implementation and putting them into daily practice meets certain difficulties, especially in the early stage. the aim of the study was to analyse the course of implementation of the eras protocol into daily practice on the basis of adherence to the protocol. group included 92 patients (43f/49m) with colorectal cancer submitted to laparoscopic resection during the years 2013-2014. perioperative care in all of them based on eras protocol consisting of 16 items. its principles and discharge criteria were based on the guidelines of the eras society guidelines. the entire analysed group of patients was divided into 3 subgroups (30 patients) depending on the time from eras protocol implementation. we analysed the compliance with the protocol and its influence on length of hospital stay, postoperative complications and readmission rate in different subgroups. the average compliance with the protocol differed significantly between groups and was 65% in group 1, 83.9% in group 2 and 89.6% in group 3. the compliance with subsequent protocol elements was different. the length of stay and complication rate was statistically different in analysed subgroups. the whole group demonstrated an inverse correlation between compliance and length of stay. this analysis leads to the conclusion that the introduction of the eras protocol is a gradual process, and its compliance at the level of 80% or more requires at least 30 patients and the period of about 6 months. the initial derogation from the assumed proceedings is inevitable and should not discourage further action. particular emphasis in the initial stage should be put on continuous training of personnel of all specialties and continuous evaluation of the results.
activity of daily living is associated with circulating cd34+/kdr+ cells and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor levels in patients after myocardial infarction. the article provides a review of the role of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (g-csf) for mobilization and transplantation of peripheral blood progenitor and stem cells. recombinant gene technology has permitted the production of highly purified material for therapeutic use in humans. progenitor cells can be assessed using semisolid and liquid culture assays or direct immunofluorescence analysis of cells expressing cd34. this antigen is found on lineage-determined hematopoietic progenitor cells as well as on more primitive stem cells with extensive self-renewal capacity. administration of g-csf during steady-state hematopoiesis or following cytotoxic chemotherapy leads to an increase of hematopoietic progenitor cells in the peripheral blood. the level of circulating cd34+ cells post-chemotherapy is greater compared with g-csf administration during steady state. on the other hand, cd34+ cells harvested post-chemotherapy contain a smaller proportion of more primitive progenitor cells (cd34+/hla-dr- or cd34+/cd38-) compared with g-csf treatment alone. independent of the mobilization modality, the amount of previous cytotoxic chemo- and radiotherapy adversely affects the yield of hematopoietic progenitor cells. while continuous subcutaneous administration of g-csf between 5 and 16 micrograms/kg bodyweight is preferred, additional dose-finding studies may be helpful to optimize current dose schedules. adhesion molecules like l-selectin, vla (very late antigen)-4 and lfa (leukocyte function antigen)-1 are likely to play a role in mobilization, since these antigens are expressed on cd34+ cells from bone marrow in different densities compared with blood-derived cd34+ cells collected following g-csf-supported cytotoxic chemotherapy. it is also relevant for transplantation that during g-csf-enhanced recovery post-chemotherapy, peripheral blood is enriched with a greater proportion of cd34+ cells expressing thy-1 in comparison with cd34+ cells from bone marrow samples obtained on the same day or before the mobilization therapy was started. the early nature of the cd34+/thy-1+ cells is very likely since this phenotype has been found on stem cells from human fetal liver and bone marrow and on cord blood cells. as a result, g-csf-mobilized blood stem cells provide rapid and sustained engraftment following high-dose therapy, including myeloablative regimens. positive selection of cd34+ cells as well as ex vivo expansion using different cytokines are currently being investigated for purging and improvement of short-term recovery post-transplantation. future developments include the use of blood-derived hematopoietic stem cells for somatic gene therapy. the availability of growth factors has been an important prerequisite for the development of these new avenues for cell therapy.
down-regulation of hydrogen sulfide biosynthesis accompanies murine interstitial cells of cajal dysfunction in partial ileal obstruction the aim of this study was to assess the quantity of interstitial cells of cajal (icc) in the lower esophageal sphincter (les) in achalasia. les muscle was obtained from 11 achalasia and nine esophageal cancer (control) patients during surgery. immunohistochemistry was performed and average cell counts per high-power field (hpf) were obtained. overall, more icc were observed in achalasia (median = 14.0 cells/hpf; range = 0–22.6 cells/hpf) as compared with controls (median = 6.2 cells/hpf; range = 1.6–10.8 cells/hpf) (p = 0.047). there were two subsets of findings within the achalasia group: 8/11(73%) had an increased quantity of icc (median = 17.1 cells/hpf; range = 11.6–22.6; p = 0.015) as compared with controls, whereas the remaining 3/11(27%) had a paucity of icc (median = 0 cells/hpf; range = 0–2; p = 0.02). icc levels were positively correlated with age of the patient (p = 0.043). our study demonstrates that subsets of abnormal icc levels are observed in idiopathic achalasia of the esophagus.
assessing biodiversity integrity for the conservation of grazed and burnt grassland systems: avian field metabolic rates as a rapid assessment tool in this study, we investigated the responses of two faunal groups, birds and arthropods, to varying degrees of disturbance caused by fire and grazing in south africa, eight study sites of varying fire frequency and stocking density were studied over two summer seasons (october–march). bird assemblages reflected habitat disturbance in a diversity of ways, driven by factors ranging from direct disturbance to changes in habitat structure and functioning, and shifts in food availability. similarly, arthropod diversity and abundance changed seasonally in response to management practices. fire frequency drives faunal assemblage structure and abundance and, in most cases, overrides the effects of grazing at all taxonomic levels. in particular, fire frequency strongly influenced grassland-breeding birds because farms are burnt in the territory-forming stage of the breeding cycle. insectivores and nectarivores were disproportionately impacted by intensive commercial management. of particular concern in this system is the yellow-breasted pipit (anthus chloris), which is regionally and globally vulnerable because of habitat loss. this species is sensitive to any form of habitat disturbance, highlighting the need for conservation attention in these grasslands. of the ten arthropod orders present in the study area, only orthoptera responded positively to burning. however, orthopterans made up on average 78% of arthropod biomass in moist highland grasslands, resulting in high grasshopper biomass on annually burnt farms: this high biomass in turn supports an abundance of insectivores. this reinforces the importance of process-oriented data where a measure of performance, such as reproductive success, is considered in assessing ecosystem condition.
detecting corresponding vertex pairs between planar tessellation datasets with agglomerative hierarchical cell-set matching a large family of algorithms - supervised or unsupervised; stemming from statistics or geometry theory - has been designed to provide different solutions to the problem of dimensionality reduction. despite the different motivations of these algorithms, we present in this paper a general formulation known as graph embedding to unify them within a common framework. in graph embedding, each algorithm can be considered as the direct graph embedding or its linear/kernel/tensor extension of a specific intrinsic graph that describes certain desired statistical or geometric properties of a data set, with constraints from scale normalization or a penalty graph that characterizes a statistical or geometric property that should be avoided. furthermore, the graph embedding framework can be used as a general platform for developing new dimensionality reduction algorithms. by utilizing this framework as a tool, we propose a new supervised dimensionality reduction algorithm called marginal fisher analysis in which the intrinsic graph characterizes the intraclass compactness and connects each data point with its neighboring points of the same class, while the penalty graph connects the marginal points and characterizes the interclass separability. we show that mfa effectively overcomes the limitations of the traditional linear discriminant analysis algorithm due to data distribution assumptions and available projection directions. real face recognition experiments show the superiority of our proposed mfa in comparison to lda, also for corresponding kernel and tensor extensions
bacterial sbp56 identified as a cu-dependent methanethiol oxidase widely distributed in the biosphere abstract. microbial cycling of volatile organic sulfur compounds (voscs), especially dimethyl sulfide (dms) and methanethiol (mt), is intensively studied because these compounds play an important role in the processes of global warming, acid precipitation, and the global sulfur cycle. vosc concentrations in freshwater sediments are low due to the balance between the formation and degradation of these compounds. these reactions occur for the greater part at the oxic/anoxic interphase of sediment and water column. in contrast to marine ecosystems, where dimethylsulfoniopropionate is the main precursor of mt and dms, in freshwater ecosystems, voscs are formed mainly by methylation of sulfide and to a lesser extent from the degradation of s-containing amino acids. one of the major routes for dms and mt formation through sulfide methylation is anaerobic o-demethylation of methoxylated aromatic compounds. inhibition studies have revealed that the major part of the endogenously produced mt and dms is degraded anaerobically by methanogens. the major bacterial groups involved in formation and consumption of voscs are described.

concomitant production of detergent compatible enzymes by bacillus flexus xju-1 abstract lipases, triacylglycerol hydrolases, are an important group of biotechnologically relevant enzymes and they find immense applications in food, dairy, detergent and pharmaceutical industries. lipases are by and large produced from microbes and specifically bacterial lipases play a vital role in commercial ventures. some important lipase-producing bacterial genera include bacillus, pseudomonas and burkholderia. lipases are generally produced on lipidic carbon, such as oils, fatty acids, glycerol or tweens in the presence of an organic nitrogen source. bacterial lipases are mostly extracellular and are produced by submerged fermentation. the enzyme is most commonly purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography, in addition to some modern approaches such as reverse micellar and aqueous two-phase systems. most lipases can act in a wide range of ph and temperature, though alkaline bacterial lipases are more common. lipases are serine hydrolases and have high stability in organic solvents. besides these, some lipases exhibit chemo-, regio- and enantioselectivity. the latest trend in lipase research is the development of novel and improved lipases through molecular approaches such as directed evolution and exploring natural communities by the metagenomic approach.
in praise of impredicativity: a contribution to the formalisation of meta-programming we describe a fragment of higher-order horn logic which can be used as a higher-order extension of prolog. it allows the programmer to axiomatize predicates of predicates and operations on predicates. the restrictions defining the fragment ensure that the higher-order predicates and operations defined are monotonic and continuous—that they are enumeration operators. as a result, the fragment is well behaved both denotationally and operationally. denotationally, the meaning of a program is its minimal herbrand model, using standard extensional higher-order model theory. operationally, it can still be implemented efficiently with standard techniques, using an adapted resolution theorem prover. the fragment is in fact (almost) a subset of hilog—a “pure” subset with simple semantics and a straightforward implementation.
bidirectional associations between parental warmth, callous unemotional behavior, and behavior problems in high-risk preschoolers seven hundred thirty-one income-eligible families in 3 geographical regions who were enrolled in a national food supplement program were screened and randomized to a brief family intervention. at child ages 2 and 3, the intervention group caregivers were offered the family check-up and linked parenting support services. latent growth models on caregiver reports at child ages 2, 3, and 4 revealed decreased behavior problems when compared with the control group. intervention effects occurred predominantly among families reporting high levels of problem behavior at child age 2. families in the intervention condition improved on direct observation measures of caregivers' positive behavior support at child ages 2 and 3; improvements in positive behavior support mediated improvements in children's early problem behavior.
typical monoterpenes as insecticides and repellents against stored grain pests global warming and deforestation have resulted in the relocation of many living creatures including insects during the recent years. this has affected the population balance of disease vectors including mosquitoes resulting in outbreaks. traditionally, mankind has been using plants as means of protection from the mosquitoes which are considered to be environment friendly unlike the synthetic chemicals that cause major risk to human health and the ecosystem. researchers explored mainly, essential oils and traditional plants using different testing methodologies to find out repellent molecules effective against mosquitoes which is the main focus of this review. among the promising plant species, eucalyptus spp., ocimum spp. and cymbopogon spp. are the most cited. data of repellency produced from the bioassay systems is difficult to quantify because of different parameters, testing system and standards of material used against mosquitoes. mainly, the human forearm based bioassays have been used with different sizes of treatment area in the laboratory and the results have not been tested in the field conditions for residual activity. in addition, effectiveness of essential oils and their protection time can be increased by using vanillin as synergist and formulation techniques like microencapsulation and nanoemulsion. there is a need to develop an alternate in vitro bioassay system that can address the problems of uniformity of the results.
can noninvasive brain stimulation enhance cognition in neuropsychiatric disorders? background the pathophysiology of depression may include synaptic hypoactivity of left prefrontal cortex. several groups of investigators have described improved mood associated with rapid transcranial magnetic stimulation (rtms) but have not looked for possible cognitive side effects associated with left prefrontal magnetic stimulation.   methods we measured the effects of left prefrontal rtms on mood, cognition, and motor evoked potential threshold in 10 patients with medication-resistant major depression.   results in a 2-week open trial of left prefrontal rtms off antidepressant medications, scores on the hamilton rating scale for depression and the beck depression inventory decreased by 41% and 40%, respectively. after resuming pre-rtms antidepressant medication, improvement in mood was still significant at 1 and 3 months later. rtms had no adverse effects on neuropsychological performance. rtms treatments were associated with significant decreases in motor evoked potential threshold in the 9 of 10 patients who remained off psychotropic medications during the 2-week treatment period.   conclusions these preliminary data suggest that left prefrontal rtms is safe and improves mood in patients with medication-resistant major depression. changes in motor evoked potential threshold suggest that prefrontal rtms may alter brain activity at sites remote from the stimulation. double-blind, sham-controlled studies are needed.
combinatorial gene regulatory functions underlie ultraconserved elements in drosophila identifying the sequences that direct the spatial and temporal expression of genes and defining their function in vivo remains a significant challenge in the annotation of vertebrate genomes. one major obstacle is the lack of experimentally validated training sets. in this study, we made use of extreme evolutionary sequence conservation as a filter to identify putative gene regulatory elements, and characterized the in vivo enhancer activity of a large group of non-coding elements in the human genome that are conserved in human–pufferfish, takifugu (fugu) rubripes, or ultraconserved in human–mouse–rat. we tested 167 of these extremely conserved sequences in a transgenic mouse enhancer assay. here we report that 45% of these sequences functioned reproducibly as tissue-specific enhancers of gene expression at embryonic day 11.5. while directing expression in a broad range of anatomical structures in the embryo, the majority of the 75 enhancers directed expression to various regions of the developing nervous system. we identified sequence signatures enriched in a subset of these elements that targeted forebrain expression, and used these features to rank all ∼3,100 non-coding elements in the human genome that are conserved between human and fugu. the testing of the top predictions in transgenic mice resulted in a threefold enrichment for sequences with forebrain enhancer activity. these data dramatically expand the catalogue of human gene enhancers that have been characterized in vivo, and illustrate the utility of such training sets for a variety of biological applications, including decoding the regulatory vocabulary of the human genome.
congenital cataract, facial dysmorphism and demyelinating neuropathy (ccfdn) in 10 czech gypsy children – frequent and underestimated cause of disability among czech gypsies backgrounddata provided by the social sciences as well as genetic research suggest that the 8-10 million roma (gypsies) who live in europe today are best described as a conglomerate of genetically isolated founder populations. the relationship between the traditional social structure observed by the roma, where the group is the primary unit, and the boundaries, demographic history and biological relatedness of the diverse founder populations appears complex and has not been addressed by population genetic studies.resultsrecent medical genetic research has identified a number of novel, or previously known but rare conditions, caused by private founder mutations. a summary of the findings, provided in this review, should assist diagnosis and counselling in affected families, and promote future collaborative research. the available incomplete epidemiological data suggest a non-random distribution of disease-causing mutations among romani groups.conclusionalthough far from systematic, the published information indicates that medical genetics has an important role to play in improving the health of this underprivileged and forgotten people of europe. reported carrier rates for some mendelian disorders are in the range of 5 -15%, sufficient to justify newborn screening and early treatment, or community-based education and carrier testing programs for disorders where no therapy is currently available. to be most productive, future studies of the epidemiology of single gene disorders should take social organisation and cultural anthropology into consideration, thus allowing the targeting of public health programs and contributing to the understanding of population structure and demographic history of the roma.
predicting therapeutic response in patients with heart failure: the story of c-reactive protein the circulating acute phase reactant c-reactive protein (crp) has traditionally been characterized as an effector of nonclonal host resistance since it activates the classical complement cascade and mediates phagocytosis, but it is also capable of regulating inflammation. the three-dimensional structure of human crp has revealed the molecular basis for complement activation and binding of phosphate monoesters. crp gene expression by liver hepatocytes in response to cytokines (il-1β and il-6) released in tissues requires several transcription factors which interact. elevated levels of crp are a prognostic marker for coronary artery disease; however, the role of crp in atheriosclerosis remains unknown. crp also mediates direct host protection to some microbial pathogens via its opsonic activity through certain fcγ-receptors. the crp response may be one of the links between nonspecific innate immunity and specific clonal immunity.
analysis of a global reactive transport model and results for the momas benchmark reactive transport models are complex nonlinear partial differential algebraic equations (pdae), coupling the transport engine with the geochemical operator. we propose an efficient and robust global numerical method, based on a method of lines and differential algebraic equations (dae) solvers, combined with a newton method using a powerful sparse linear solver. numerical experiments show the performances of the method. we also propose a unified framework to describe classical methods such as sequential non-iterative approach, sequential iterative approach, direct substitution approach and compare them with our global method.
c/ebp homologous protein (chop) deficiency aggravates hippocampal cell apoptosis and impairs memory performance abstract multiple signal transduction pathways are capable of modifying bcl-2 family members to reset susceptibility to apoptosis. we used two-dimensional peptide mapping and sequencing to identify three residues (ser70, ser87, and thr69) within the unstructured loop of bcl-2 that were phosphorylated in response to microtubule-damaging agents, which also arrest cells at g2/m. changing these sites to alanine conferred more antiapoptotic activity on bcl-2 following physiologic death signals as well as paclitaxel, indicating that phosphorylation is inactivating. an examination of cycling cells enriched by elutriation for distinct phases of the cell cycle revealed that bcl-2 was phosphorylated at the g2/m phase of the cell cycle. g2/m-phase cells proved more susceptible to death signals, and phosphorylation of bcl-2 appeared to be responsible, as a ser70ala substitution restored resistance to apoptosis. we noted that ask1 and jnk1 were normally activated at g2/m phase, and jnk was capable of phosphorylating bcl-2. expression of a series of wild-type and dominant-negative kinases indicated an ask1/jun n-terminal protein kinase 1 (jnk1) pathway phosphorylated bcl-2 in vivo. moreover, the combination of dominant negative ask1, (dnask1), dnmkk7, and dnjnk1 inhibited paclitaxel-induced bcl-2 phosphorylation. thus, stress response kinases phosphorylate bcl-2 during cell cycle progression as a normal physiologic process to inactivate bcl-2 at g2/m.
two new species of taeniolina from southern china trichaptum imbricatum, t. perenne and t. podocarpi are three new species from china. they are described, illustrated and compared in this paper with similar species. trichaptum imbricatum is unique in its imbricate basidiocarps, white to cream hymenophores, small and regular pores, and scattered and thin-walled cystidia. trichaptum perenne differs from other species in the genus in its perennial and pileate habit, its large pores and entire dissepiments, and oblong, ellipsoid basidiospores. trichaptum podocarpi is distinguished in having totally resupinate basidiocarps, distinctly long cystidia, and in its habitat on podocarpus. a key to species of trichaptum occurring in china is provided; statistical variations of spore dimensions for each species are included in the key.
internet interventions for improving psychological well‐being in psycho‐oncology: review and recommendations in 2004, the international society for research on internet interventions (isrii) was formed to encourage ehealth researchers to collaborate in their efforts to further the science behind developing, testing, and disseminating web-based treatment programs. the group held its second meeting (april 2006) to clarify the society’s direction and identify key issues that need addressing in the field. these issues are identified and examined in the current paper. given the success of using the internet to treat a range of medical and mental health problems, and the growing need for better dissemination of health care, internet interventions will almost certainly play a prominent role in global health. isrii plans to provide the necessary venue to ensure the science driving this field is strong, enabling researchers to conduct the highest quality research and permitting meaningful conclusions from completed studies.
the composition of pericarp, cell aging, and changes in water absorption in two tomato genotypes: mechanism, factors, and potential role in fruit cracking xyloglucan endotransglycosylase (xet) catalyses the transglycosylation of xyloglucan, the major hemicellulose polymer, which has been thought to mediate the cross-linking of cellulose microfibrils in cellular walls and proposed to be involved in the control of cell wall relaxation. to understand the relationship between litchi fruit cracking and gene expression patterns, three xet genes from litchi fruit were identified and then examined for their expression profiles in pericarp and aril tissues at different development stages, using a cracking-resistant cultivar, 'huaizhi', and a cracking-susceptible cultivar, 'nuomici'. three full-length cdnas of 1267, 1095 and 1156 bp encoding xets, named lcxet1, lcxet2 and lcxet3, respectively, were isolated from expanding fruit using rt-pcr and race-pcr (rapid amplification of cdna ends) methods. northern blotting analysis showed that lcxet1 mrna accumulation occurred much earlier in aril tissues at 59 days after anthesis (daa) than in pericarp tissues at 73 daa in 'nuomici'. however, it appeared at almost the same time (66 daa) in pericarp and aril tissues in 'huaizhi', which suggested that differential accumulation of lcxet1 in pericarp and aril tissues in 'nuomici' and 'huaizhi' was closely associated with fruit cracking. lcxet2 mrna accumulation could be detected in pericarp and aril tissues throughout fruit development but exhibited a differential accumulation pattern between pericarp and aril tissues. in the aril of 'nuomici', intensive signal bands were detectable at 59-73 daa in rapidly expanding fruits of 'nuomici' but only weak bands could be found in the pericarp tissues. in contrast, moderate signal bands were detectable both in pericarp and aril tissues of 'huaizhi' fruits. furthermore, lcxet3 showed constitutive expression in both pericarp and aril tissues of developing 'nuomici' and 'huaizhi' litchi fruit. in addition, differential expression patterns of three xets genes were observed in different tissues of litchi, with only lcxet1 being fruit-specific. to further address the role of lcxet in fruit cracking, alpha-naphthalene acetic acid (naa) was used to treat 'nuomoci' to reduce fruit cracking. enhanced lcxet1 mrna accumulation appeared in pericarp while lcxet2 and lcxet3 mrna accumulation enhanced in aril tissues in the naa-treated fruits. thus, lcxet1 is more likely to play a role in reducing litchi fruit cracking than lcxet2 and lcxet3.
enabling protocol-based medical critiquing we present a methodology and tool for providing retrospective review and critiquing of guideline-based medical care given to patients. we show how our guideline representation language, asbru, which supports the use of physicians intentions in addition to physician's actions, allows us to compare the care given to a patient at the level of the intention to treat in addition to the more detailed plan carried out. we have developed an algorithm based on this representation for retrospective quality assessment of guideline-based care. our method takes the physician's and institution's preferences and policies into account in explaining or justifying physician deviations from the recommendations of a guideline.
t-cell reactivity to insulin peptide a1-12 in children with recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes or multiple beta-cell autoantibodies. insulin antibodies, as measured by plasma radiolabeled insulin-binding capacity, were determined in 124 newly diagnosed insulin-dependent diabetic (iddm) children before and after 1, 3, and 5 days of insulin therapy. controls were 35 nondiabetic children with plasma insulin binding capacity of 1.0 ± 0.7%. the patients were divided into three groups according to their plasma insulin-binding capacity. group 1 (n = 79) had binding within two standard deviations (sd) of the control mean, group 2 (n = 20) had insulin binding 2–6 sd above controls, and group 3 (n = 25) showed insulin-binding capacity of more than 6 sd above the control mean. after exogenous insulin therapy, plasma 125i-insulin-binding capacity dropped significantly in both groups 2 and 3, concurrent with significant increases in plasma insulin levels. the three groups differed from each other in that patients in group 3 were significantly younger thanin the other groups and clinically seemed to be more severely dehydrated, as reflected in their higher levels of serum urea nitrogen, plasma glucose, potassium, and elevated pulse rate. the three groups did not differ in respect to sex, hla-dr antigens, coxsackie-b antibody titers, islet cell cytoplasmic antibodies, immunoglobulin level, and c-peptide levels. only two of 446 siblings of iddm children showed elevated insulin binding, one of whom developed iddm 6 wk later. the presence of an insulin-binding substance probably representing insulin antibodies in some cases of newly diagnosed iddm suggests that autoimmunity in this disorder is not limited to the b-cell membrane and cytoplasm and lends further support to the heterogeneity of iddm.
doping of tio2–go and tio2–rgo with noble metals: synthesis, characterization and photocatalytic performance for azo dye discoloration we report on the synthesis of phase-pure tio(2) nanoparticles in anatase, rutile and brookite structures, using amorphous titania as a common starting material. phase formation was achieved by hydrothermal treatment at elevated temperatures with the appropriate reactants. anatase nanoparticles were obtained using acetic acid, while phase-pure rutile and brookite nanoparticles were obtained with hydrochloric acid at a different concentration. the nanomaterials were characterized using x-ray diffraction, uv-visible reflectance spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy. we propose that anatase formation is dominated by surface energy effects, and that rutile and brookite formation follows a dissolution-precipitation mechanism, where chains of sixfold-coordinated titanium complexes arrange into different crystal structures depending on the reactant chemistry. the particle growth kinetics under hydrothermal conditions are determined by coarsening and aggregation-recrystallization processes, allowing control over the average nanoparticle size.
different roles of bdnf in nucleus accumbens core versus shell during the incubation of cue-induced cocaine craving and its long-term maintenance cocaine addiction in humans is associated with long-term propensity to relapse. using a rat relapse model, we found that cocaine seeking induced by exposure to cocaine-associated cues progressively increases after withdrawal. this progressive increase is associated with increases in brain-derived nerve growth factor (bdnf) levels within the mesolimbic dopamine system. based on these findings, we studied whether bdnf infusions into the ventral tegmental area (vta), the cell body region of mesolimbic dopamine neurons, would potentiate cocaine seeking after withdrawal. rats were trained to self-administer cocaine for 10 d, and cocaine seeking was measured in extinction tests 3, 10, or 30 d after withdrawal. during testing, rats were exposed to contextual cues that had predicted cocaine availability during training, and lever presses resulted in contingent presentations of a discrete tone-light cue that was previously temporally paired with cocaine infusions. bdnf (0-0.75 μg/site) or nerve growth factor (ngf; 0-0.75 μg/site) was infused into the vta 1-2 hr after the last self-administration session. to examine the role of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) pathway in bdnf effects, u0126 (1 μg/site), an mek inhibitor, was used. a single intra-vta infusion of bdnf, but not ngf, induced long-lasting enhancement of cocaine seeking for up to 30 d, an effect reversed by u0126. in contrast, neither bdnf infusions into the substantia nigra, nor acute intra-vta bdnf infusions 2 hr before testing on day 3 of withdrawal, were effective. these data suggest that bdnf-mediated neuroadaptations in mesolimbic areas are involved in the persistent cocaine seeking induced by exposure to drug cues after withdrawal.
epigenetics in formation, function, and failure of the endocrine pancreas the surface of nucleosomes is studded with a multiplicity of modifications. at least eight different classes have been characterized to date and many different sites have been identified for each class. operationally, modifications function either by disrupting chromatin contacts or by affecting the recruitment of nonhistone proteins to chromatin. their presence on histones can dictate the higher-order chromatin structure in which dna is packaged and can orchestrate the ordered recruitment of enzyme complexes to manipulate dna. in this way, histone modifications have the potential to influence many fundamental biological processes, some of which may be epigenetically inherited.
spatial dissimilarities in plankton structure and function during flood pulses in a semi-arid floodplain wetland system hurlbert divides experimental ecologist into ‘those who do not see any need for dispersion (of replicated treatments and controls), and those who do recognize its importance and take whatever measures are necessary to achieve a good dose of it’. experimental ecologists could also be divided into those who do not see any problems with sacrificing spatial and temporal scales in order to obtain replication, and those who understand that appropriate scale must always have priority over replication. if an experiment is conducted in a spatial or temporal scale, where the predictions of contesting hypotheses are convergent or ambiguous, no amount of technical impeccability can make the work instructive. conversely, replication can always be obtained afterwards, by conducting more experiments with basically similar design in different areas and by using meta-analysis. this approach even reduces the sampling bias obtained if resources are allocated to a small number of well-replicated experiments. for a strict advocate of the hypothetico-deductive method, replication is unnecessary even as a matter of principle, unless the predicted response is so weak that random background noise is a plausible excuse for a discrepancy between predictions and results. by definition, a prediction is an ‘all-statement’, referring to all systems within a well-defined category. what applies to all must apply to any. hence, choosing two systems and assigning them randomly to a treatment and a control is normally an adequate design for a deductive experiment. the strength of such experiments depends on the firmness of the predictions and their a priori probability of corroboration. replication is but one of many ways of reducing this probability. whether the experiment is replicated or not, inferential statistics should always be used, to enable the reader to judge how well the apparent patterns in samples reflect real patterns in statistical populations. the concept ‘pseudoreplication’ amounts to entirely unwarranted stigmatization of a reasonable way to test predictions referring to large-scale systems.
analysis by synthesis: 3d object recognition by object reconstruction this paper presents a novel solution for flow-based tracking and 3d reconstruction of deforming objects in monocular image sequences. a non-rigid 3d object undergoing rotation and deformation can be effectively approximated using a linear combination of 3d basis shapes. this puts a bound on the rank of the tracking matrix. the rank constraint is used to achieve robust and precise low-level optical flow estimation without prior knowledge of the 3d shape of the object. the bound on the rank is also exploited to handle occlusion at the tracking level leading to the possibility of recovering the complete trajectories of occluded/disoccluded points. following the same low-rank principle, the resulting flow matrix can be factored to get the 3d pose, configuration coefficients, and 3d basis shapes. the flow matrix is factored in an iterative manner, looping between solving for pose, configuration, and basis shapes. the flow-based tracking is applied to several video sequences and provides the input to the 3d non-rigid reconstruction task. additional results on synthetic data and comparisons to ground truth complete the experiments.
erythrocytes do not activate purified and platelet soluble guanylate cyclases even in conditions favourable for no synthesis it is now appreciated that two parallel systems regulate nitric oxide (no) formation and signaling in biological systems and the vasculature. the first is the canonical endothelial no synthase (enos) system, which catalyzes a five-electron oxidation of l-arginine to form no and citrulline [30]. the second is the nitrate–nitrite–no pathway, a more primitive, oxygen-independent and reductive pathway, clearly of great importance in bacteria and plants and only more recently found to regulate mammalian control of blood pressure, energetics, and hypoxic vasodilation [6,11,12,25,26,29]. now, as described in the current study by velmurugan and colleagues [40], this pathway may also inhibit platelet activation, an effect thought to be primarily regulated by no produced by enos [9,23,24,36]. although mammals do not possess nitrate reductase enzymes, the mouth commensal flora provides the necessary symbiosis, with bacterial nitrate reductase enzymes converting nitrate in food and concentrated in saliva into nitrite, which is swallowed and systemically absorbed [2,3,27]. there is cross talk between both no synthesis pathways. nitrite in the blood and tissue derives equally from nitrate reduction by oral bacteria and from intravascular oxidation of no formed from enos [35,44]. thus enos regulates blood flow via endothelial no formation and paracrine signaling to smooth muscle but also contributes to endocrine no formation via oxidation to nitrite and transport to distal sites for regional reduction to no [4,8,12]. interestingly, both systems also generate superoxide, as the no synthase system can become uncoupled in settings of subcellular l-arginine and tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency or enos glutathionylation (oxidation), and then exhibits an oxidase activity, forming superoxide rather than no [5]. the enzymes that have been shown to reduce nitrite to no, such as the molybdopterin family members xanthine oxidase and aldehyde oxidase [21,22,28,42,45] and the heme globin family, hemoglobin, myoglobin, and neuroglobin [6,10,17,38,39], can all form superoxide as well. the fact that these systems can generate no, superoxide, or both provides for a diversified signaling profile from no, superoxide, peroxynitrite, nitrogen dioxide, and dinitrogen trioxide [1,13,41]. nitrite itself is uniquely positioned as a relatively stable reactive nitrogen species (half-life in humans of approximately 40 min) but is readily reduced to no, oxidized to nitrogen dioxide and dinitrogen trioxide, and protonated to form nitrous acid–nitrosonium cation [41]. thus nitrite may contribute to redox signaling via no activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase, as well as targeting protein cysteine and tyrosine residues to regulate posttranslational signaling. although it has been known for almost 3 decades that oral nitrate can be reduced in the mouth to form nitrite, which is then converted in the stomach to no to regulate mucosal blood flow, mucus production, and mucosal host defense via no-mediated bacterial killing [2,3,27], a role for nitrite in the systemic formation of no and systemic vasomotor function was only more recently appreciated [6,12,29]. it is now increasingly clear that nitrite, derived from dietary nitrate and enos, regulates blood pressure, blood flow, hypoxic vasodilation, and the cellular resilience to ischemia and reperfusion cytotoxicity in the heart and liver [6,7,12,18,42,43]. more recently, a role for this pathway in the control of mitochondrial proton leak and respiratory efficiency has been described [19,20]. the current study by velmurugan and colleagues [40] explores a new chapter in the role of the nitrate–nitrite–no pathway in cardiovascular function, by identifying an effect of dietary nitrate supplementation on platelet activation; importantly this effect requires red cells for bioconversion of nitrite to no (fig. 1). more specifically, the study summarizes the results of two randomized placebo-controlled crossover studies, each in 24 healthy subjects, assessing the acute effects of dietary nitrate or potassium nitrate capsules on platelet reactivity. oral nitrate in beet root juice or as a pure chemical raised circulating nitrate and nitrite levels, inhibited ex vivo platelet aggregation responses to adp and collagen, and reduced platelet p-selectin expression and elevated platelet cgmp levels. interestingly, these effects were observed in vivo (inhibition of platelets after oral nitrate supplementation) and in vitro with exposure of nitrite to whole blood, but not to platelet-rich plasma, suggesting a role for the red cells in the conversion of nitrite to signaling no. these findings thus further promote a physiological role for oral nitrate in the regulation of cardiovascular function, vasomotor control, energetics, and hemostasis, via formation of circulating nitrite.
the peroxin pex34p functions with the pex11 family of peroxisomal divisional proteins to regulate the peroxisome population in yeast the abundance and size of cellular organelles vary depending on the cell type and metabolic needs. peroxisomes constitute a class of cellular organelles renowned for their ability to adapt to cellular and environmental conditions. together with transcriptional regulators, two groups of peroxisomal proteins have a pronounced influence on peroxisome size and abundance. pex11‐type peroxisome proliferators are involved in the proliferation of peroxisomes, defined here as an increase in size and/or number of peroxisomes. dynamin‐related proteins have recently been suggested to be required for the scission of peroxisomal membranes. this review surveys the function of pex11‐type peroxisome proliferators and dynamin‐related proteins in peroxisomal proliferation and division.
proteins related to the type i secretion system are associated with secondary seca_dead domain proteins in some species of planctomycetes, verrucomicrobia, proteobacteria, nitrospirae and chlorobi abstract planctomycetes represent a remarkable clade in the domain bacteria because they play crucial roles in global carbon and nitrogen cycles and display cellular structures that closely parallel those of eukaryotic cells. studies on planctomycetes have been hampered by the lack of genetic tools, which we developed for planctomyces limnophilus.
coupling of prostate and thyroid cancer diagnoses in the united states importance we have previously reported on a doubling of thyroid cancer incidence-largely due to the detection of small papillary cancers. because they are commonly found in people who have died of other causes, and because thyroid cancer mortality had been stable, we argued that the increased incidence represented overdiagnosis.   objective to determine whether thyroid cancer incidence has stabilized.   design analysis of secular trends in patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer, 1975 to 2009, using the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (seer) program and thyroid cancer mortality from the national vital statistics system.   setting nine seer areas (seer 9): atlanta, georgia; connecticut; detroit, michigan; hawaii; iowa; new mexico; san francisco-oakland, california; seattle-puget sound, washington; and utah.   participants men and women older than 18 years diagnosed as having a thyroid cancer between 1975 and 2009 who lived in the seer 9 areas.   interventions none.   main outcomes and measures thyroid cancer incidence, histologic type, tumor size, and patient mortality. results since 1975, the incidence of thyroid cancer has now nearly tripled, from 4.9 to 14.3 per 100,000 individuals (absolute increase, 9.4 per 100,000; relative rate [rr], 2.9; 95% ci, 2.7-3.1). virtually the entire increase was attributable to papillary thyroid cancer: from 3.4 to 12.5 per 100,000 (absolute increase, 9.1 per 100,000; rr, 3.7; 95% ci, 3.4-4.0). the absolute increase in thyroid cancer in women (from 6.5 to 21.4 = 14.9 per 100,000 women) was almost 4 times greater than that of men (from 3.1 to 6.9 = 3.8 per 100,000 men). the mortality rate from thyroid cancer was stable between 1975 and 2009 (approximately 0.5 deaths per 100,000).   conclusions and relevance there is an ongoing epidemic of thyroid cancer in the united states. the epidemiology of the increased incidence, however, suggests that it is not an epidemic of disease but rather an epidemic of diagnosis. the problem is particularly acute for women, who have lower autopsy prevalence of thyroid cancer than men but higher cancer detection rates by a 3:1 ratio.
the aesthetic and cultural interests of patients attending an acute hospital--a phenomenological study. aim the purpose of this study was to illuminate the experiences of older adults' return to leisure activities, following rehabilitation, post-stroke.   method a phenomenological approach was used to explore the experiences of re-engaging in leisure occupations post-stroke. in-depth interviews were conducted with five community-dwelling individuals (three men, two women) aged 68-74 years who had experienced a stroke in the past year. data were analysed using thematic analysis.   findings four themes emerged: (i) re-engaging in leisure activities, (ii) acceptance of physical limitations post-stroke, (iii) gratitude for help and support and (iv) looking forward to the future.   conclusion implications revealed that post-stroke interventions need a more occupation-focussed approach, including return to leisure at an earlier stage of stroke rehabilitation.
an imperceptible and robust audio watermarking algorithm this paper presents a secure, robust, and blind adaptive audio watermarking algorithm based on singular value decomposition (svd) in the discrete wavelet transform domain using synchronization code. in our algorithm, a watermark is embedded by applying a quantization-index-modulation process on the singular values in the svd of the wavelet domain blocks. the watermarked signal is perceptually similar to the original audio signal and gives high quality output. experimental results show that the hidden watermark data is robust to additive noise, resampling, low-pass filtering, requantization, mp3 compression, cropping, echo addition, and denoising. performance analysis of the proposed scheme shows low error probability rates. the data embedding rate of the proposed scheme is 45.9 bps. the proposed scheme has high payload and superior performance against mp3 compression compared to the earlier audio watermarking schemes.
tick-borne encephalitis virus sequenced directly from questing and blood-feeding ticks reveals quasispecies variance tick-borne encephalitis virus (tbev) is a flavivirus with major impact on global health. the geographical tbev distribution is expanding, thus making it pivotal to further characterize the natural virus populations. in this study, we completed the earlier partial sequencing of a tbev pulled out of a pool of rna extracted from 115 ticks collected on torö in the stockholm archipelago. the total rna was sufficient for all sequencing of a tbev genome (torö-2003), without conventional enrichment procedures such as cell culturing or suckling mice amplification. to our knowledge, this is the first time that the genome of tbev has been sequenced directly from an arthropod reservoir. the torö-2003 sequence has been characterized and compared with other tbe viruses. in silico analyses of secondary rna structures formed by the two untranslated regions revealed a temperature-sensitive structural shift between a closed replicative form and an open aug accessible form, analogous to a recently described bacterial thermoswitch. additionally, novel phylogenetic conserved structures were identified in the variable part of the 3'-untranslated region, and their sequence and structure similarity when compared with earlier identified structures suggests an enhancing function on virus replication and translation. we propose that the thermo-switch mechanism may explain the low tbev prevalence often observed in environmentally sampled ticks. finally, we were able to detect variations that help in the understanding of virus adaptations to varied environmental temperatures and mammalian hosts through a comparative approach that compares rna folding dynamics between strains with different mammalian cell passage histories.
transcriptome sequencing and expression analysis of cadmium (cd) transport and detoxification related genes in cd-accumulating salix integra heavy metal (hm)-accumulating herbaceous and woody plants are employed for phytoremediation. to develop improved strategies for enhancing phytoremediation efficiency, knowledge of the microstructural, physiological and molecular responses underlying hm-accumulation is required. here we review the progress in understanding the structural, physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying hm uptake, transport, sequestration and detoxification, as well as the regulation of these processes by signal transduction in response to hm exposure. the significance of genetic engineering for enhancing phytoremediation efficiency is also discussed. in herbaceous plants, hms are taken up by roots and transported into the root cells via transmembrane carriers for nutritional ions. the hms absorbed by root cells can be further translocated to the xylem vessels and unloaded into the xylem sap, thereby reaching the aerial parts of plants. hms can be sequestered in the cell walls, vacuoles and the golgi apparatuses. plant roots initially perceive hm stress and trigger the signal transduction, thereby mediating changes at the molecular, physiological, and microstructural level. signaling molecules such as phytohormones, reactive oxygen species (ros) and nitric oxide (no), modulate plant responses to hms via differentially expressed genes, activation of the antioxidative system and coordinated cross talk among different signaling molecules. a number of genes participated in hm uptake, transport, sequestration and detoxification have been functionally characterized and transformed to target plants for enhancing phytoremediation efficiency. fast growing woody plants hold an advantage over herbaceous plants for phytoremediation in terms of accumulation of high hm-amounts in their large biomass. presumably, woody plants accumulate hms using similar mechanisms as herbaceous counterparts, but the processes of hm accumulation and signal transduction can be more complex in woody plants.
adipophilin affects the expression of tnf-α, mcp-1, and il-6 in thp-1 macrophages objective—reduced plasma concentrations of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (hdl-c) are a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease. mechanisms that regulate hdl-c concentrations represent an important area of investigation. methods and results—comparative transcriptome analyses of monocyte-derived macrophages (mdm) from a large population of low hdl-c subjects and age- and sex-matched controls revealed a cluster of inflammatory genes highly expressed in low hdl-c subjects. the expression levels of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (ppar) γ and several antioxidant metallothionein genes were decreased in mdm from all low hdl-c groups compared with controls, as was the expression of other genes regulated by pparγ, including cd36, adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (fabp4), and adipophilin (adfp). in contrast, pparδ expression was increased in mdm from low hdl-c groups. quantitative rt-pcr corroborated all major findings from the microarray analysis in two separate patient cohorts. expression of several inflammatory cytokine genes including interleukin 1β, interleukin 8, and tumor necrosis factor α were highly increased in low hdl-c subjects. conclusions—the activated proinflammatory state of monocytes and mdm in low hdl-c subjects constitutes a novel parameter of risk associated with hdl deficiency, related to altered expression of metallothionein genes and the reciprocal regulation of pparγ and pparδ.
differential migration of passenger leukocytes and rapid deletion of naive alloreactive cd8 t cells after mouse liver transplantation background. although graft-resident passenger leukocytes are known to mediate acute rejection by triggering direct allorecognition, they may also act in an immunomodulatory fashion and play an important role in tolerance induction. our purpose in the current study was to utilize rat bone marrow chimeras to evaluate the role of the genotype of passenger leukocytes in both acute rejection and tolerance of liver allografts. methods. the fate of livers bearing donor-type, recipient-type, and third-party passenger leukocytes was evaluated in the mhc class i and ii mismatched rejector combination aci→lew and the acceptor combination pvg→da. results. we report that although treatment of aci liver donors with lethal irradiation does not lead to prolongation of graft survival in the aci→lew strain combination, aci livers bearing recipient-type (lew) or third-party passenger leukocytes (bn) are rejected at a significantly slower rate. we confirm that lethal irradiation of pvg donor animals leads to abrogation of tolerance induction with acute rejection of their livers by da recipients. however, the majority of pvg livers carrying donor-type (pvg), recipient-type (da), or third-party (lew) passenger leukocytes are accepted for >100 days. these da recipients develop immune tolerance to the donor parenchyma (pvg). conclusions. our findings demonstrate that long-term acceptance of liver allografts and tolerance induction is not dependent on the presence of donor-type passenger leukocytes and can be achieved with organs carrying donor-type, recipient-type, or third-party passenger leukocytes. the importance of the mhc framework on the surface of passenger leukocytes as a critical regulator of the immune response after transplantation of chimeric organs is substantiated by the delayed tempo of rejection of aci livers bearing recipient-type or third-party passenger leukocytes in the aci→lew strain combination.
protective effect of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate against photo-damage induced by ultraviolet a in human skin fibroblasts ultraviolet (uv) exposure induces photodamage of skin. it is a matter of concern that the level of uv radiation reaching the earth surface is increasing as a result of depletion of the stratospheric ozone, and climate change. it is urgently necessary to develop strategies to protect the skin from uv-induced injuries. tea extracts are gaining increasing attention as a supplement in skin care products. however, the factors contributing to the photoprotective effects of tea extracts have not been systematically defined and conflicting results about the effect of tea extracts on photodamage have been reported. in this paper, the literature dealing with the use of tea and its extracts for the prevention of photodamage to the skin as well as the photoprotective effects of tea and its extracts have been highlighted. the potential chemopreventive agents in tea include catechins, caffeine, polysaccharides, apigenin and luteolin which inhibit, reverse or retard the process of the skin photodamage via their sunscreen and antioxidant properties, regulation of signal transduction pathway and gene expression, alleviation of dna damage, and modulation immunological function are also presented. existing gaps in this research field include incomplete clarity of photochemopreventive mechanism of tea, the adverse or side effects of tea extracts owing to residues or impurity and the instability of the functional components of tea during storage.
phylogeny of linearia and notata groups of paspalum l. (poaceae, panicoideae, paniceae) and related species phylogenetic analyses of four plastid dna regions, the rbcl exon, trnl intron, trnl-trnf intergenic spacer, and rps16 intron from each of 73 species in the african genus moraea (iridaceae: irideae) including accessions of all major species clusters in the genus, show moraea to be paraphyletic when barnardiella, galaxia, hexaglottis, homeria (all southern african), and gynandriris (eurasian as well) were recognized as separate genera. there are several small, isolated species clusters at the basal nodes of the tree that are all restricted to the winter-rainfall zone of southern africa (the greater cape floral kingdom) and a few, highly derived, large species groups that have radiated extensively within the winter-rainfall zone. mapping of floral traits shows that an iris-type flower is ancestral in moraea. floral changes are associated with shifts in pollination systems, either from passive pollen deposition on long-tongued bees foraging for nectar to active pollen collection by female bees foraging for pollen, fly, or hopliine scarab beetle pollination. dating the nodes of the phylogenetic tree using non-parametric rate smoothing with a calibration point derived from broad dating of the angiosperms indicates that the divergence between moraea and its sister genus ferraria occurred about 25 mya in the early miocene. the early radiation of moraea took place against a background of aridification and the spread of open habitats, such as desert, shrubland, and fynbos.
a comparative study of changes in vertical dimension of occlusion using four different investing methods anecdotal evidence suggests that many dental laboratories are surrounding the teeth and gingival margins of the wax patterns for complete dentures with silicone laboratory putty prior to investing in dental stone or plaster to facilitate deflasking and polishing. this project investigates differences in dimension during processing when putty is used. two groups of ten standardised dentures, one group with silicone, one group without were processed. cross arch measurements were made before and after processing using an eight hour curing cycle followed by slow cooling. no statistically significant difference in change in dimension was observed between the two groups, indicating that this is an acceptable method.
macular pigment density changes in japanese individuals supplemented with lutein or zeaxanthin: quantification via resonance raman spectrophotometry and autofluorescence imaging age-related macular degeneration (amd) is thought to be the result of a lifetime of oxidative insult that results in photoreceptor death within the macula. increased risk of amd may result from low levels of lutein and zeaxanthin (macular pigment) in the diet, serum or retina, and excessive exposure to blue light. through its light-screening capacity and antioxidant activity, macular pigment may reduce photooxidation in the central retina. lutein supplements, at 30 mg/d, were shown previously to increase serum lutein and macular pigment density in two subjects. in this study, we compared the effects of a range of lutein doses (2.4- 30 mg/d), as well as a high zeaxanthin dose (30 mg/d), on the serum and macular pigment in a series of experiments. serum carotenoids were quantified by hplc. macular pigment densities were determined psychophysically. serum lutein concentrations in each subject reached a plateau that was correlated with the dose (r = 0.82, p < 0.001). plateau concentrations ranged from 2.8 x 10(-7) to 2.7 x 10(-6) mol/l. zeaxanthin was less well absorbed than an equal lutein dose, resulting in plateaus of approximately 5 x 10(-7) mol/l. the rate of increase in macular pigment optical density was correlated with the plateau concentration of carotenoids in the serum (r = 0.58, p < 0.001), but not with the presupplementation optical density (r = 0.13, p = 0.21). the mean rate of increase was (3.42 +/- 0.80) x 10(5) mau/d per unit concentration (mol/l) of carotenoids in the serum. it remains to be demonstrated whether lutein or zeaxanthin dietary supplements reduce the incidence of amd.
hepatocytes produce tnf-α following hypoxia-reoxygenation and liver ischemia-reperfusion in a nadph oxidase- and c-src-dependent manner. reactive oxygen species are ubiquitous signaling molecules in biological systems. four members of the nadph oxidase (nox) enzyme family are important sources of reactive oxygen species in the vasculature: nox1, nox2, nox4, and nox5. signaling cascades triggered by stresses, hormones, vasoactive agents, and cytokines control the expression and activity of these enzymes and of their regulatory subunits, among which p22phox, p47phox, noxa1, and p67phox are present in blood vessels. vascular nox enzymes are also regulated by rac, clc-3, poldip2, and protein disulfide isomerase. multiple nox subtypes, simultaneously present in different subcellular compartments, produce specific amounts of superoxide, some of which is rapidly converted to hydrogen peroxide. the identity and location of these reactive oxygen species, and of the enzymes that degrade them, determine their downstream signaling pathways. nox enzymes participate in a broad array of cellular functions, including differentiation, fibrosis, growth, proliferation, apoptosis, cytoskeletal regulation, migration, and contraction. they are involved in vascular pathologies such as hypertension, restenosis, inflammation, atherosclerosis, and diabetes. as our understanding of the regulation of these oxidases progresses, so will our ability to alter their functions and associated pathologies.
impacts of sediments on coral energetics: partitioning the effects of turbidity and settling particles summarydespite the pre-eminence of the great barrier reef, there has been little systematic description of its biotic communities, and in particular, of the corals themselves. only recently have the problems of coral taxonomy been sufficiently resolved to allow a beginning to be made in rectifying this deficiency. the present study describes seventeen assemblages of corals which occupy the major habitat types found in and near the central great barrier reef. the habitats studied range from the wave swept reef flats of coral sea atolls to the slopes of small reefs occupying sheltered, muddy conditions near the coast. these, and the array of reefs between, have characteristic suites of coral communities which provide the basis for a classification of reefs into non-acropora reefs and various acropora reefs. it is speculated that the faunistic differences are maintained because reefs are primarily self-seeded and because the majority of larvae from external sources are of species which are already present. the greatest diversity of both species and community types was found on reefs near the middle of the continental shelf, while the oceanic atolls and nearshore silt-affected reefs are almost equally depauperate.
unusual configurations of personality traits indicate multiple patterns of their coalescence it is argued that if we compute self-other agreement on some personality traits then we possess no or very little information about the individuals who are the targets of this judgment. this idea is largely based on two separate ways of computing self-other agreement: trait agreement (rt) and profile agreement (rp), which are typically associated with two different trait-centered and person-centered approaches in personality research. personality traits of 4115 targets from czech, belgian, estonian, and german samples were rated by themselves and knowledgeable informants. we demonstrate that trait agreement can be partialled into individual contributions so that it is possible to show how much each individual pair of judges contributes to agreement on a particular trait. similarly, it is possible to decompose agreement between two personality profiles into the individual contributions of traits from which these profiles are assembled. if normativeness is separated from distinctiveness of personality scores and individual profiles are ipsatized, then mean profile agreement rp becomes identical to mean trait agreement rt. the views that trait-by-trait analysis does not provide information regarding accuracy level of a particular pair of judges and profile analysis does not permit assessment of the relative contributions of traits to overall accuracy are not supported.
a general method to solve complex problems by combining multiple answer set programs we first introduce abstract dpll, a rule-based formulation of the davis--putnam--logemann--loveland (dpll) procedure for propositional satisfiability. this abstract framework allows one to cleanly express practical dpll algorithms and to formally reason about them in a simple way. its properties, such as soundness, completeness or termination, immediately carry over to the modern dpll implementations with features such as backjumping or clause learning.we then extend the framework to satisfiability modulo background theories (smt) and use it to model several variants of the so-called lazy approach for smt. in particular, we use it to introduce a few variants of a new, efficient and modular approach for smt based on a general dpll(x) engine, whose parameter x can be instantiated with a specialized solver solvert for a given theory t, thus producing a dpll(t) system. we describe the high-level design of dpll(x) and its cooperation with solvert, discuss the role of theory propagation, and describe different dpll(t) strategies for some theories arising in industrial applications.our extensive experimental evidence, summarized in this article, shows that dpll(t) systems can significantly outperform the other state-of-the-art tools, frequently even in orders of magnitude, and have better scaling properties.
the synthetic cannabinoid win55212‐2 decreases the intraocular pressure in human glaucoma resistant to conventional therapies we used reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to detect the expression of the central and peripheral cannabinoid receptors (cb1 and cb2, respectively) mrna, and western blotting to show the presence of the cb1 protein in subregions of the human eye. cb2 mrna transcripts were undetectable, while levels of cb1 mrna were significantly expressed in the human retina (25.8 ± 2.46%), ciliary body (210 ± 11.55%) and iris (62.7 ± 5.94%) when compared with those of the normalizing reference gene β2 microglobulin. the cb1 gene encodes a functional protein which is detected in its glycosylated (63 kda) and unglycosylated (54 kda) form in the same areas by a specific purified antibody raised against the amino terminus (residues 1–77) of the cb1 receptor. these results further support the proposed role of the cb1 receptor in controlling intraocular pressure, helping to explain the antiglaucoma properties of marijuana.
multiplanar osteotomy with limited wide margins: a tissue preserving surgical technique for high-grade bone sarcomas background the purpose of this study was to analyze a series of patients with a high-grade metaphyseal osteosarcoma of the knee who had been treated with a transepiphyseal resection, with preservation of the distal femoral and the proximal tibial (articular) portions of the epiphysis, and an intercalary allograft reconstruction.   methods the cases of thirteen patients with a high-grade metaphyseal osteosarcoma around the knee who had transepiphyseal resection and reconstruction with an intercalary allograft were retrospectively reviewed at a mean of sixty-three months. complications, disease-free survival of the patient, final preservation of the limb and epiphysis, and functional results according to the musculoskeletal tumor society scoring system were documented at the time of the latest follow-up.   results at the final follow-up examination, eleven of the thirteen patients continued to be disease-free. one patient died of bone and pulmonary metastases with no evidence of local recurrence, and the remaining patient had no evidence of disease after resection of a local recurrence of the tumor in the soft tissues. no patient had a local recurrence in the remaining epiphysis. seven patients had complications that included a fracture (three patients), diaphyseal nonunion (two), deep infection (one), and a local recurrence in the soft tissues (one). the allograft was removed in only four of these patients. at the latest follow-up examination, twelve patients were alive with preserved limbs. in one patient, the epiphysis, which originally had been preserved, was resected because of a metaphyseal fracture, and the limb was reconstructed with an osteoarticular allograft. the patients with a preserved epiphysis had an average functional score of 27 points (maximum, 30 points).   conclusions preservation of the epiphysis in high-grade metaphyseal osteosarcoma at the knee is an alternative in carefully selected patients. crucial factors needed to obtain local tumor control and achieve an acceptable functional result are a positive response to chemotherapy, accurate preoperative assessment of tumor extension to the epiphysis, and appropriate fixation techniques for intercalary allografts.   level of evidence therapeutic study, level iv (case series [no, or historical, control group]). see instructions to authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

multiview absolute pose using 3d – 2d perspective line correspondences and vertical direction a large number of absolute pose algorithms have been presented in the literature. common performance criteria are computational complexity, geometric optimality, global optimality, structural degeneracies, and the number of solutions. the ability to handle minimal sets of correspondences, resulting solution multiplicity, and generalized cameras are further desirable properties. this paper presents the first pnp solution that unifies all the above desirable properties within a single algorithm. we compare our result to state-of-the-art minimal, non-minimal, central, and non-central pnp algorithms, and demonstrate universal applicability, competitive noise resilience, and superior computational efficiency. our algorithm is called unified pnp (upnp).
the hippocampal/parahippocampal regions and recognition memory: insights from visual paired comparison versus object-delayed nonmatching in monkeys monkeys in whom the fornix had been transected and controls were trained on two versions of delayed non-matching to sample (dnms). on dnms-lss the stimulus pair for each trial was selected from a large set of junk objects so that the animals saw particular stimuli infrequently. on dnms-rs the same two stimuli were presented repeatedly. memory for the sample was assessed with retention intervals of 10, 70 and 130 sec spent either in the dark or with levels of illumination designed to promote interference effects. on dnms-lss the lesioned animals were impaired, being more susceptible than controls to increases in the retention interval. however, neither group was particularly sensitive to interference. in contrast, on dnms-rs the lesioned monkeys were unimpaired, both groups showing a marked decrement in performance with increasing retention interval and a high sensitivity to the effects of interference. these data suggest that monkeys possess a short-term memory which is intact after transection of the fornix and a long-term memory which is not.
intradural prostate carcinoma metastatic lesion mimicking an exophytic ependymoma: case report the management of 10 patients with symptomatic localized intradural extramedullary spinal metastasis is reviewed. the single most common primary source was carcinoma of the breast (four cases). the initial symptom in nine patients was pain, with five patients reporting a characteristically severe cramping discomfort with radicular distribution. all patients underwent laminectomy decompression. at the time of surgery, six of the patients were weak but ambulatory and four were bedridden. following surgery, four patients enjoyed some measure of pain relief, seven patients became ambulatory, and three remained bedridden. two patients achieved a "satisfactory" result, and were walking and continent 6 months after surgery. secondary brain tumors were demonstrated or implicated in nine patients, supporting the concept that the spinal metastases represented tertiary deposits following dissemination via the cerebrospinal fluid. symptomatic intradural extramedullary spinal metastasis causes a virulent clinical syndrome with poor prognosis and disappointing outcome after treatment. given the high incidence of associated cerebral metastatic involvement, total neuraxis radiation and/or chemotherapy should be considered when symptomatic spinal metastasis is discovered to be intradural and extramedullary.
the clinical manifestations of vestibular migraine: a review. vestibular migraine presents with attacks of spontaneous or positional vertigo, head motion-induced vertigo, and visual vertigo lasting 5 minutes to 3 days. the recent classification of vestibular migraine, jointly proposed by the bárány society and the international headache society, allows identification of vestibular migraine and probable vestibular migraine based on explicit criteria. the diagnosis is based on symptom type, severity and duration, a history of migraine, temporal association of migraine symptoms with vertigo attacks, and exclusion of other causes. because headache is often absent during acute attacks, other migraine features such as photophobia or auras have to be specifically inquired about. during acute attacks, one may find central spontaneous or positional nystagmus, and less commonly, unilateral vestibular hypofunction. in the symptom-free interval, vestibular testing adds little to the diagnosis as findings are mostly minor and nonspecific. the pathophysiology of vestibular migraine is unknown, but several mechanisms link the trigeminal system, which is activated during migraine attacks, and the vestibular system. treatment includes antiemetics for severe acute attacks, pharmacological migraine prophylaxis, and lifestyle changes.
nfκb mediated elevation of kcnj11 promotes tumor progression of hepatocellular carcinoma through interaction of lactate dehydrogenase a. ion channels have emerged as regulators of developmental processes. in model organisms and in people with mutations in ion channels, disruption of ion channel function can affect cell proliferation, cell migration, and craniofacial and limb patterning. alterations of ion channel function affect morphogenesis in fish, frogs, mammals, and flies, demonstrating that ion channels have conserved roles in developmental processes. one model suggests that ion channels affect proliferation and migration through changes in cell volume. however, ion channels have not explicitly been placed in canonical developmental signaling cascades until recently. this review gives examples of ion channels that influence developmental processes, offers a potential underlying molecular mechanism involving bone morphogenetic protein (bmp) signaling, and finally explores exciting possibilities for manipulating ion channels to influence cell fate for regenerative medicine and to impact disease.
a survey of fuzzy control for stabilized platforms a three-dimensional fuzzy logic controller (3-d flc) is presented for the control of distributed parameter system (dps). different to the traditional flc, the 3-d flc deals with three-dimensional fuzzy set (3-d fuzzy set), i.e. the traditional fuzzy set plus spatial dimension. the proposed flc still consists of defuzzification, rule inference, and defuzzification. different to the traditional flc, the 3-d flc can fuse information measured from space domain into a spatial membership function, and then rules will not increase as sensors increase for spatial measurement. therefore, the 3-d flc has the capability to handle spatial information. application of the 3-d flc is presented for a catalytic packed-bed reactor to show the effectiveness of the new fuzzy controller design, and comparisons with the traditional fuzzy controller are also given

preparation and characterization of chitin benzoic acid esters trifluoroacetic anhydride is an effective promoter for the preparation of chitin single- and mixed-acid esters. complete dissolution is achieved within 30 min when powdered chitin is heated at 70 degrees c in a mixed solution of carboxylic acid(s) and trifluoroacetic anhydride. chitin esters prepared are chitin acetate, chitin butyrate, chitin hexanoate and chitin octanoate, chitin co-acetate/butyrate, chitin co-acetate/hexanoate, chitin co-acetate/octanoate, chitin co-acetate/palmitate, each from a solution of the respective reactants. the products have degrees of o-acyl substitution in a range of ds 1-2 depending on the nature of acyl group, as analyzed by gas-liquid and high-pressure liquid chromatography. acetic acid as a mutual component for the mixed-acid esters increases the total degree of substitution, and the acetyl substitution is close to the relative distribution in the reaction mixture for chitin co-acetate/butyrate. it is favored over hexanoate, octanoate, and palmitate. the parent molecules, as calculated by the composition of the chitin esters and their molecular weights by light-scattering spectroscopy, are 30 kda for the smallest and 150-151 kda for the largest. films of these chitin derivatives when cast from solution are strong and flexible with limited extensibility. by dynamic mechanical analysis of the ester film, it was found that both the glass transition temperature (t(g)) and the tensile modulus (e' at 25 degrees c) are highest for chitin acetate (218 degrees c and 5.8 gpa), and lowest for chitin octanoate (182 degrees c and 1.5 gpa). for the other esters, these values lie between the above-cited values, where the t(g) and the e' decrease with an increase in the chain length of the acyl constituent.
ambivalence in grief therapy: the interplay between change and self-stability the term resistance has an overly negative connotation, indicating a recalcitrant, oppositional tendency on the part of psychotherapy clients. this article emphasizes the inevitability and ubiquity of resistance and argues that it should be greeted as a therapist's friend, not as an enemy. it is the way in which clients present themselves to the world in general and to the therapist in particular. five forms of resistance are presented, including: resistance to the recognition of feelings, fantasies, and motives; resistance to revealing feelings toward the therapist; resistance as a way of demonstrating self-sufficiency; resistance as clients' reluctance to change their behavior outside the therapy room; and resistance as a function of failure of empathy on the part of the therapist. vignettes from the author's practice and from the cases presented in this issue are discussed in terms of these five modes of resistance and their treatment.
wind fields in heterogeneous conifer canopies: parameterisation of momentum absorption using high-resolution 3d vegetation scans abstract a mathematical, computer-based, dynamic sway model of a sitka spruce (picea sitchensis) tree was developed and tested against measurements of the movement of a tree within a forest. the model tree was divided into segments each with a stiffness, mass and damping parameter. equations were formulated to describe the response of every segment which together form a system of coupled differential equations. these were solved with the aid of matrices and from the resulting modes, the transfer function of the tree was found and used to calculate the movement of the tree in the wind. comparison of the modelled movement of a tree in response to the measured wind speed above a forest canopy gave good agreement with the measured movement of the top of the tree but less satisfactory agreement close to the base. the comparison also pointed to the complexity of tree response to the wind and inadequacies in the model. in particular, the branches need to be treated as coupled cantilevers attached to the stem rather than simply as masses lumped together.
a mitochondria-anchored isoform of the actin-nucleating spire protein regulates mitochondrial division masterminding mitochondrial fission mitochondria are highly dynamic and undergo fusion and fission and they move in cells. defects in mitochondrial dynamics are implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases. recent findings have suggested that mitochondrial fission occurs preferentially at endoplasmic reticulum (er) contact sites, with er circumscribing mitochondria and possibly promoting the constriction of mitochondria during fission. korobova et al. (p. 464) now suggest that an er-localized formin, inf2, is required for mitochondrial fission and that inf2-mediated actin polymerization facilitates mitochondrial constriction. actin filaments between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria promote mitochondrial fission. mitochondrial fission is fundamentally important to cellular physiology. the dynamin-related protein drp1 mediates fission, and interaction between mitochondrion and endoplasmic reticulum (er) enhances fission. however, the mechanism for drp1 recruitment to mitochondria is unclear, although previous results implicate actin involvement. here, we found that actin polymerization through er-localized inverted formin 2 (inf2) was required for efficient mitochondrial fission in mammalian cells. inf2 functioned upstream of drp1. actin filaments appeared to accumulate between mitochondria and inf2-enriched er membranes at constriction sites. thus, inf2-induced actin filaments may drive initial mitochondrial constriction, which allows drp1-driven secondary constriction. because inf2 mutations can lead to charcot-marie-tooth disease, our results provide a potential cellular mechanism for this disease state.
biofilter performance and characterization of a biocatalyst degrading alkylbenzene gases a biological trickling filter for treatment of toluene-containing waste gas was studied. the overall kinetics of the biofilm growth was followed in the early growth phase. a rapid initial colonization took place during the first three days. the biofilm thickness increased exponentially, whereas the incease of active biomass and polymers was linear. in order to investigate the toluene degradation, various toluene degraders from the multispecies biofilm were isolated, and a pseudomonas putida was chosen as a representative of the toluene-degrading population. a specific rrna oligonucleotide probe was used to follow the toluene-degrading p. putida in the multispecies biofilm in the filter by means of number and cellular rrna content. p. putida appeared to detach from the biofilm during the first three days of growth, after which p. putida was found at a constant level of 10% of the active biomass in the biofilm. based on the rrna content, the in situ activity was estimated to be reduced to 20% of cells grown at maximum conditions in batch culture. the toluene degraded by p. putida was estimated to be a minor part (11%) of the overall toluene degradation.
a multirisk approach to predicting chronicity of postpartum depression symptoms the development of a 10-item self-report scale (epds) to screen for postnatal depression in the community is described. after extensive pilot interviews a validation study was carried out on 84 mothers using the research diagnostic criteria for depressive illness obtained from goldberg's standardised psychiatric interview. the epds was found to have satisfactory sensitivity and specificity, and was also sensitive to change in the severity of depression over time. the scale can be completed in about 5 minutes and has a simple method of scoring. the use of the epds in the secondary prevention of postnatal depression is discussed.
bidirectional associations between parental warmth, callous unemotional behavior, and behavior problems in high-risk preschoolers seven hundred thirty-one income-eligible families in 3 geographical regions who were enrolled in a national food supplement program were screened and randomized to a brief family intervention. at child ages 2 and 3, the intervention group caregivers were offered the family check-up and linked parenting support services. latent growth models on caregiver reports at child ages 2, 3, and 4 revealed decreased behavior problems when compared with the control group. intervention effects occurred predominantly among families reporting high levels of problem behavior at child age 2. families in the intervention condition improved on direct observation measures of caregivers' positive behavior support at child ages 2 and 3; improvements in positive behavior support mediated improvements in children's early problem behavior.
analysis of in vitro binding of dietary fibers by the phytoestrogen, daidzein, in the presence and absence of iron equol, a nonsteroidal estrogen of dietary origin, was recently identified in human urine, and is excreted in amounts comparable to the classical steroidal estrogens. we confirm here that phytoestrogens which are abundant in dietary soya protein are converted by human gastrointestinal flora to this weak estrogen. after the ingestion of meals containing cooked soya protein the urinary excretion of equol in four of six subjects studied increased by up to 1000-fold and this compound was the major phenolic compound found in the urine. these data also indicate that some subjects are unable to either produce or excrete equol despite the challenge of a diet containing soya. in view of the increasing use of commercial soya products in the diet and the capacity of human bacterial flora to synthesize this weak estrogen from the abundance of phytoestrogens in soya, the potential relevance of these observations to the diseases implicating steroid hormones is discussed.

a critical period for nicotine-induced disruption of synaptic development in rat auditory cortex the role of basal forebrain-derived cholinergic afferents in the development of neocortex was studied in postnatal rats. newborn rat pups received intraventricular injections of 192 igg-saporin. following survival periods ranging from 2 days to 6 months, the brains were processed to document the cholinergic lesion and to examine morphological consequences. immunocytochemistry for choline acetyltransferase (chat) and in situ hybridization for chat mrna demonstrate a loss of approximately 75% of the cholinergic neurons in the medial septum and nucleus of the diagonal band of broca in the basal forebrain. in situ hybridization for glutamic acid decarboxylase mrna reveals no loss of basal forebrain gabaergic neurons. acetylcholinesterase histochemistry demonstrates a marked reduction of the cholinergic axons in neocortex. cholinergic axons are reduced throughout the cortical layers; this reduction is more marked in medial than in lateral cortical areas. the thickness of neocortex is reduced by approximately 10%. retrograde labeling of layer v cortico-collicular pyramidal cells reveals a reduction in cell body size and also a reduction in numbers of branches of apical dendrites. spine densities on apical dendrites are reduced by approximately 20-25% in 192 igg-saporin-treated cases; no change was detected in number of spines on basal dendrites. these results indicate a developmental or maintenance role for cholinergic afferents to cerebral cortical neurons.
risk factors of venous thromboembolism in thai patients. in a prospective study all positive phlebographies within the well‐defined population of the city of malmö, sweden, during 1987 were studied in order to determine the incidence of deep venous thrombosis (dvt). epidemiological data were analysed for the detection of patient groups at increased risk of dvt. the incidence was found to be equal for both sexes, i.e. 1.6 per 1000 inhabitants and year. risk factors were found to be in accordance with earlier studies. the median age for men was 66 years, compared to 72 years for women. at diagnosis of dvt, 19% of subjects had a known malignancy and within 1 year 5% (19 cases) developed a new malignancy. of the men, 29% had postoperative or post‐traumatic (fracture) dvt, compared to 46% of the women. fewer patients with dvt than expected (39%) belonged to blood group 0 (31%) (p < 0.005). pulmonary embolism (pe) was clinically suspected in only 5% of cases, and diagnosis was verified scintigraphically in 2% of cases. none of these died of pe, but of 6 patients who were found to have pe at autopsy, four died about 4 weeks after the dvt was diagnosed.
multiple infection sources identification with provable guarantees assume a network (v,e) where a subset of the nodes in v are active. we consider the problem of selecting a set of k active nodes that best explain the observed activation state, under a given information-propagation model. we call these nodes effectors. we formally define the k-effectors problem and study its complexity for different types of graphs. we show that for arbitrary graphs the problem is not only np-hard to solve optimally, but also np-hard to approximate. we also show that, for some special cases, the problem can be solved optimally in polynomial time using a dynamic-programming algorithm. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to consider the k-effectors problem in networks. we experimentally evaluate our algorithms using the dblp co-authorship graph, where we search for effectors of topics that appear in research papers.

emergence of cooperative long-term market loyalty in double auction markets self-tuning experience weighted attraction (ewa) is a one-parameter theory of learning in  games. it addresses a criticism that an earlier model (ewa) has too many parameters, by  fixing some parameters at plausible values and replacing others with functions of experience  so that they no longer need to be estimated. consequently, it is econometrically simpler  than the popular weighted fictitious play and reinforcement learning models.  the functions of experience which replace free parameters “self-tune” over time, adjusting  in a way that selects a sensible learning rule to capture subjects’ choice dynamics. for  instance, the self-tuning ewa model can turn from a weighted fictitious play into an averaging  reinforcement learning as subjects equilibrate and learn to ignore inferior foregone  payoffs. the theory was tested on seven different games, and compared to the earlier parametric  ewa model and a one-parameter stochastic equilibrium theory (qre). self-tuning  ewa does as well as ewa in predicting behavior in new games, even though it has fewer  parameters, and fits reliably better than the qre equilibrium benchmark.
effects of the exotic invader musculista senhousia on benthic communities of two mediterranean lagoons synopsis. non-indigenous species (nis) are increasingly conspicuous in marine and estuarine habitats throughout the world, as the number, variety, and effects of these species continue to accrue. most of these nis invasions result from anthropogenic dispersal. although the relative importance of different dispersal mechanisms varies both spatially and temporally, the global movement of ballast water by ships appears to be the largest single vector for nis transfer today, and many recent invasions have resulted from this transfer. the rate of new invasions may have increased in recent decades, perhaps due to changes in ballast water transport. estuaries have been especially common sites of invasions, accumulating from tens to hundreds of nis per estuary that include most major taxonomic and trophic groups. we now know of approximately 400 nis along the pacific, atlantic and gulf coasts of the u.s., and hundreds of marine and estuarine nis are reported from other regions of the world. although available information about invasions is limited to a few regions and underestimates the actual number of nis invasions, there are apparent differences in the frequency of nis among sites. mechanisms responsible for observed patterns among sites likely include variation in supply of nis, and perhaps variation in properties of recipient or donor communities, but the role of these mechanisms has not been tested. although our present knowledge about the extent, patterns and mechanisms of marine invasions is still in its infancy, it is clear that nis are a significant force of change in marine and especially estuarine communities globally. taxonomically diverse nis are having significant effects on many, if not most, estuaries that fundamentally alter population, community, and ecosystems processes. the impacts of most nis remain unknown, and the predictability of their direct and indirect effects remains uncertain. nonetheless, based upon the documented extent of nis invasions and scope of then* effects, studies of marine communities that do not include nis are increasingly incomplete.
magnetic resonance imaging for rapid screening for the nephrotoxic and hepatotoxic effects of microcystins the microcystins (mcs) lr and yr are hepatotoxins produced by some species of freshwater cyanobacteria. only a few reports on the acute nephrotoxicity of mcs have been published to date. here we investigate the effects on rat kidneys of chronic administration of relatively low doses of mc lr and mc yr. male wistar rats were injected every second day for 8 months with mc lr (10 microg/kg i.p., n=5) and mc yr (10 microg/kg i.p., n=5). the control group was treated with vehicle, a mixture containing 0.8 % ethanol and 0.2 % methanol in 0.9 % saline (3.7 ml/kg i.p., n=5). we found that mcs could induce damage to the kidney cortex and medulla. the lesions mainly consisted of damaged and dilated tubuli filled with homogenous eosinophil material. we conclude that long-term exposure to relatively low doses of mcs poses a considerable risk for kidney injury.
rna polymerase elongation factors. the universal bacterial transcription elongation factor nusa mediates elongation activities of rna polymerase. by itself, nusa induces transcription pausing and facilitates intrinsic termination, but nusa also is a cofactor of antiterminators that antagonize pausing and prevent termination. we show that nusa is required for lambda-related phage 82 antiterminator q(82) to construct a stable complex in which rna-based termination mechanisms have restricted access to the emerging transcript; this result suggests a locale for both q(82) and nusa near the beta flap domain of rna polymerase. furthermore, as nusa is not required for the antipausing activity of q(82) in vitro, we distinguish two distinct activities of antiterminators, namely antipausing and rna occlusion, and discuss their roles in q(82) function.
alternative interventions to prevent oxidative damage following ischemia/reperfusion oxidative stress is considered a major contributor to etiology of both “normal” senescence and severe pathologies with serious public health implications. mitochondria generate reactive oxygen species (ros) that are thought to augment intracellular oxidative stress. mitochondria possess at least nine known sites that are capable of generating superoxide anion, a progenitor ros. mitochondria also possess numerous ros defense systems that are much less studied. studies of the last three decades shed light on many important mechanistic details of mitochondrial ros production, but the bigger picture remains obscure. this review summarizes the current knowledge about major components involved in mitochondrial ros metabolism and factors that regulate ros generation and removal. an integrative, systemic approach is applied to analysis of mitochondrial ros metabolism, which is now dissected into mitochondrial ros production, mitochondrial ros removal, and mitochondrial ros emission. it is suggested that mitochondria augment intracellular oxidative stress due primarily to failure of their ros removal systems, whereas the role of mitochondrial ros emission is yet to be determined and a net increase in mitochondrial ros production in situ remains to be demonstrated.
targeting mapk pathway in melanoma therapy the mitogen activated protein kinase (mapk) pathway plays a key role in melanoma development making it an important therapeutic target. in normal cells, the tightly regulated pathway relays extracellular signals from cell membrane to nucleus via a cascade of phosphorylation events. in melanomas, dysregulation of the mapk pathway occurs frequently due to activating mutations in the b-raf and ras genes or other genetic or epigenetic modifications, leading to increased signaling activity promoting cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, migration, survival and angiogenesis. however, identification of ideal pathway member to therapeutically target for maximal clinical benefit to melanoma patients remains a challenge. this review provides an overview of the obstacles faced targeting the mapk pathway and why certain therapeutic approaches succeed while others fail. the review summarizes the roles played by the proteins, therapeutic potential and the drugs available to target each member of the pathway as well as concerns related to each. potential for targeting multiple points and inhibiting other pathways along with mapk inhibition for optimal efficacy are discussed along with explanations for development of drug resistance, which includes discussions related to cross-talk between pathways, raf kinase isoform switching and phosphatase deregulation. finally, the use of nanotechnology is reviewed as an approach to target the mapk pathway using both genetic and pharmacological agents simultaneously targeting multiple points in the pathway or in combination with other cascades.
closed-form solutions for options in incomplete markets february , 2013 in this paper we study both market risks and nonmarket risks, without complete markets assumption, and discuss methods of measurement of these risks. we present and justify a set of four desirable properties for measures of risk, and call the measures satisfying these properties "coherent." we examine the measures of risk provided and the related actions required by span, by the sec/nasd rules, and by quantile-based methods. we demonstrate the universality of scenario-based methods for providing coherent measures. we offer suggestions concerning the sec method. we also suggest a method to repair the failure of subadditivity of quantile-based methods. copyright blackwell publishers inc 1999.
power efficiency of outer hair cell somatic electromotility 1. the microchamber method was used to examine the motile responses of isolated guinea pig outer hair cells to electrical stimulation. in the microchamber method, an isolated cell is drawn partway into a suction pipette and stimulated transcellularly. the relative position of the cell in the microchamber is referred to as the exclusion fraction. 2. the length changes of the included and excluded segments were compared for constant sinusoidal stimulus amplitude as functions of the exclusion fraction. both included and excluded segments showed maximal responses when the cell was excluded approximately halfway. both segments showed smaller or absent responses when the cell was almost fully excluded or almost fully included. 3. when the cell was near to, but not at, the maximum exclusion, the included segment response amplitude was zero, whereas the excluded segment response amplitude was nonzero. in contrast, when the cell was nearly fully included, the excluded segment response amplitude was zero, but the included segment response amplitude was still detectable. a simple model of outer hair cell motility based on these results suggests that the cell has finite-resistance terminations and that the motors are restricted to a region above the nucleus and below its ciliated apex (cuticular plate). 4. the function describing length change as a function of command voltage was measured for each segment as the exclusion fraction was varied. the functions were similar at midrange exclusions (i.e., when the segments were about equal length), showing nonlinearity and saturability. the functions were strikingly different when the segment lengths were different. the effects of exclusion on the voltage to length-change functions suggested that the nonlinearity and saturability are local properties of the motility mechanism. 5. the diameter changes of both segments were examined. the segment diameter changes were always antiphasic to the length changes. this finding implies that the motility mechanism has an active antiphasic diameter component. the diameter change amplitude was a monotonically increasing function of exclusion for the included segment, and a decreasing function for the excluded segment. 6. the voltage to length-change and voltage to diameter-change functions were measured for the same cell and exclusion fraction. the voltage to diameter-change function was smaller in amplitude than the voltage to length-change function. the functions were of opposite polarity to each other, but were otherwise similar in character. thus it is likely that the same motor mechanism is responsible for both axial and diameter deformations.
tonic inhibition in principal cells of the amygdala: a central role for α3 subunit-containing gabaa receptors the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain, gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba), is thought to regulate memory processes by activating transient inhibitory postsynaptic currents. here we describe a nonsynaptic, tonic form of inhibition in mouse ca1 pyramidal neurons that is generated by a distinct subpopulation of gaba type a receptors (gaba(a)rs). this tonic inhibitory conductance is predominantly mediated by alpha5 subunit-containing gaba(a)rs (alpha5gaba(a)rs) that have different pharmacological and kinetic properties compared to postsynaptic receptors. gaba(a)rs that mediate the tonic conductance are well suited to detect low, persistent, ambient concentrations of gaba in the extracellular space because they are highly sensitive to gaba and desensitize slowly. moreover, the tonic current is highly sensitive to enhancement by amnestic drugs. given the restricted expression of alpha5gaba(a)rs to the hippocampus and the association between reduced alpha5gaba(a)r function and improved memory performance in behavioral studies, our results suggest that tonic inhibition mediated by alpha5gaba(a)rs in hippocampal pyramidal neurons plays a key role in cognitive processes.
individual comparisons of the levels of (e)-3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid, an axillary odor-related compound, in japanese. the axillary microflora of 229 subjects was characterized quantitatively and the results correlated with whether the odor was pungent body odor or instead a faint "acid odor". the axillary flora was found to be a stable mixture of micrococcaceae, aerobic diphtheroids and propionibacteria. significantly higher numbers of bacteria were recovered from the axilla of those with pungent axillary odor than in those with acid odor. aerobic diphtheroids in high numbers were recovered in all subjects having typical body odor. these included lipophilic as well as large-colony diphtheroids. when droplets of apocrine sweat placed on the forearm were inoculated with various bacteria which reside in the axilla, only diphtheroids generated typical body odor. cocci produced a sweaty odor attributable to isovaleric acid.
proline-rich cell wall proteins accumulate in growing regions and phloem tissue in response to water deficit in common bean seedlings two antigenically related glycoproteins, called p33 and p36, accumulate in the soluble fraction of the cell wall in response to water deficit in phaseolus vulgaris. in this report, we show that p33 and p36 are able to adhere to leaf protoplasts, and that they bind to plasma membrane (pm) vesicles in a divalent cation-dependent manner. data from the partial amino acid sequence of the p33 and p36 proteins indicate that they contain repeats of the decapeptide povykpovek; therefore, they are related to proline-rich proteins. binding assays demonstrate that both proteins specifically bind to an 80 kda pm protein. this binding is competed with a peptide that contains the rgd motif, as well as with fibronectin, which also includes this sequence, suggesting that the 80 kda pm protein has an integrin-like function whose natural ligands are p33 and p36. this is the first case where a pm ligand for a higher plant cell wall protein has been identified.
bone substitute materials delivering zoledronic acid: physicochemical characterization, drug load, and release properties the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid chemically and physically was bound to hydroxyapatite-coated porous tantalum implants. the zoledronic acid elution characteristics in saline were determined as a function of time and the in vivo effects of elution were quantified at 12 weeks in a canine ulnar implant model. intramedullary implants surgically were implanted bilaterally into the ulnae of a control group of five dogs and a zoledronic acid-dosed (0.05 mg zoledronic acid) group of four dogs. computerized image analysis of undecalcified histologic sections was used to quantify the amount of peri-implant bone within the intramedullary canal, the percentage of available pore space filled with new bone, and the number and size of the individual bone islands within the implant pores. the data were analyzed using a hierarchical analysis of variance with 95% confidence intervals. the peri-implant bone occupied a mean of 13.8% of the canal space in controls and 32.2% of the canal space in zoledronic acid-dosed dogs, a relative difference of 134% (2.34-fold) that was significant. the mean extent of bone ingrowth was 12.5% for the control implants and 19.8% for the zoledronic acid-dosed dogs, a relative difference of 58% that was statistically significant. individual islands of new bone formation with the implant pores were similar in number in both implant groups but were 71% larger on average in the za-dosed group. we are the first authors to show that local elution of a bisphosphonate can cause substantial bone augmentation around and within porous orthopaedic implants. the concept represents a potential tool for restoration of bone stock and enhancement of implant fixation in primary and revision cementless joint arthroplasty surgeries in the face of compromised or deficient bone.
a line-1 element insertion in the 5′-noncoding region of caprine growth hormone receptor gene a polymorphic tg-repeat microsatellite is located 90 base pairs upstream from a major transcription start site in the bovine growth hormone receptor gene. a shorter allele with 11 consecutive tg is common in bos indicus cattle, whereas longer 16- to 20-tg-repeat alleles predominate in bos taurus breeds. the purpose of this study was to compare growth and carcass traits between angus steers that had two of the longer growth hormone receptor alleles with their half-siblings that had one short allele and one of the longer alleles. we genotyped 64 angus sires with respect to the poly-tg microsatellite and identified six bulls that were heterozygous in that they had one short 11-tg allele and one of the longer alleles. we then grouped 125 steer progeny of these six heterozygous bulls according to their genotypes: only the longer 16- to 20-tg-repeat alleles were found in 73 steer progeny (long/long homozygotes), whereas a short 11-tg allele was paired with one of the longer alleles in 52 progeny (short/long heterozygotes). contrasts for the long/long homozygotes vs the short/long heterozygotes were significant for weaning weight (17 +/- 4 kg; p < .001) and carcass weight (14 +/- 5 kg; p < .01). approaching significance (p = .03) was the contrast for usda marbling score (-.3 +/- .2). no significant differences (p > .05) were detected for contrasts in birth weight (.3 +/- .6 kg), longissimus muscle area (-.2 +/- 1 cm2), or carcass fat depth (-.01 +/- .07 cm). this polymorphism has potential for use in dna marker-assisted selection programs.
post-mortem assessment of hypoperfusion of cerebral cortex in alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. the amyloid-beta (a beta) peptide, which is derived from the amyloid precursor protein (app), is involved in the pathogenesis of alzheimer's dementia and impairs endothelium-dependent vasodilation in cerebral vessels. we investigated whether cerebrovascular autoregulation, i.e., the ability of the cerebral circulation to maintain flow in the face of changes in mean arterial pressure (map), is impaired in transgenic mice that overexpress app and a beta. neocortical cerebral blood flow (cbf) was monitored by laser-doppler flowmetry in anesthetized app(+) and app(-) mice. map was elevated by intravenous infusion of phenylephrine and reduced by controlled exsanguination. in app(-) mice, autoregulation was preserved. however, in app(+) mice, autoregulation was markedly disrupted. the magnitude of the disruption was linearly related to brain a beta concentration. the failure of autoregulation was paralleled by impairment of the cbf response to endothelium-dependent vasodilators. thus a beta disrupts a critical homeostatic mechanism of the cerebral circulation and renders cbf highly dependent on map. the resulting alterations in cerebral perfusion may play a role in the brain dysfunction and periventricular white-matter changes associated with alzheimer's dementia.
comparison between anterior cervical discectomy with fusion and anterior cervical corpectomy with fusion for the treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy: a meta-analysis introductionthere is considerable controversy as to which technique is best option for reconstruction after multilevel anterior decompression for cervical spondylosis. the aim of this study was to compare the clinical and radiographic results and complications of anterior cervical discectomy fusion (acdf) and anterior cervical corpectomy fusion (accf) in the treatment of multi-level cervical spondylosis.methodwe reviewed and analyzed papers published from jan 1969 to dec 2010 regarding the comparison of acdf and accf for multilevel cervical spondylosis. statistical comparisons were made when appropriate.resultstwelve studies were included in this systematic review. blood loss was greater for accf compared with acdf. similarly, the rate of graft dislodgement in accf was higher than that in acdf. nonunion rates were 18.4% for 2-level acdf and 37.3% for 3-level acdf, whereas nonfusion rates were 5.1% for single-level accf and 15.2% for 2-level accf. in addition, nonunion rates for three disc levels fused were much higher than that for two disc levels fused, regardless of discectomy or corpectomy. clinical outcome was compared between acdf and accf in nine studies. of these, similar outcome was found between acdf and accf in six studies, whereas three studies reported better outcome in accf compared with acdf.conclusionnonunion rates of acdf are higher than those of accf for multilevel cervical spondylosis. sometimes, clinical outcome of accf was better than acdf for multilevel cervical spondylosis.
tcr-cxcr4 signaling stabilizes cytokine mrna transcripts via a prex1-rac1 pathway: implications for ctcl. c-kit positive cardiac stem cells (cscs) have been shown to contribute to myocardial regeneration after infarction. previously, we have shown that the c-kit ligand stem cell factor (scf) can induce csc migration into the infarcted area during myocardial infarction (mi). however, the precise mechanism involved is not fully understood. in this study, we found that cscs also express c-x-c chemokine receptor type 4 (cxcr4), which is a typical member of the seven transmembrane-spanning g protein-coupled receptor (gpcr). in vitro, activation of c-kit signalling by scf promotes migration of cscs with increased phosphorylation of cxcr4-serine 339, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 mapk) and extracellular regulated protein kinases 1/2 (erk1/2). knockdown of cxcr4 expression by sirna reduces scf/c-kit-induced migration and downstream signalling. as previously reported, cxcr4-serine 339 phosphorylation is mainly regulated by gpcr kinase 6 (grk6); thus, silencing of grk6 expression by sirna impairs cxcr4-serine 339 phosphorylation and migration of cscs caused by scf. in vivo, knockdown of grk6 impairs the ability of cscs to migrate into peri-infarcted areas. these results demonstrate that scf-induced csc migration is regulated by the transactivation of cxcr4-serine 339 phosphorylation, which is mediated by grk6.
range-wide analysis of wildlife habitat: implications for conservation it is generally perceived that biodiversity is better protected from human activities after an area is designated as a protected area. however, we found that this common perception was not true in wolong nature reserve (southwestern china), which was established in 1975 as a “flagship” protected area for the world-renowned endangered giant pandas. analyses of remote sensing data from pre- and post-establishment periods indicate that the reserve has become more fragmented and less suitable for giant panda habitation. the rate of loss of high-quality habitat after the reserve's establishment was much higher than before the reserve was created, and the fragmentation of high-quality habitat became far more severe. after the creation of the reserve, rates of habitat loss and fragmentation inside the reserve unexpectedly increased to levels that were similar to or higher than those outside the reserve, in contrast to the situation before the reserve was created.
bidirectional associations between parental warmth, callous unemotional behavior, and behavior problems in high-risk preschoolers seven hundred thirty-one income-eligible families in 3 geographical regions who were enrolled in a national food supplement program were screened and randomized to a brief family intervention. at child ages 2 and 3, the intervention group caregivers were offered the family check-up and linked parenting support services. latent growth models on caregiver reports at child ages 2, 3, and 4 revealed decreased behavior problems when compared with the control group. intervention effects occurred predominantly among families reporting high levels of problem behavior at child age 2. families in the intervention condition improved on direct observation measures of caregivers' positive behavior support at child ages 2 and 3; improvements in positive behavior support mediated improvements in children's early problem behavior.
arbuscular mycorrhiza formation in cordate gametophytes of two ferns, angiopteris lygodiifolia and osmunda japonica many plant species are characterized by a life cycle with a long-lived, subterranean phase that is completely dependent on mycorrhizal fungal symbionts for fixed carbon. this type of life cycle is both phylogenetically and ecologically widespread and is found in diverse vascular plant lineages from the tropics to subalpine meadows. here we report on the molecular identities of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi associated with the autotrophic and underground mycoheterotrophic life cycle phases of the ferns botrychium crenulatum and b. lanceolatum. we show that the glomus taxa found in the mycoheterotrophic life cycle phases of b. crenulatum and b. lanceolatum are also found in conspecific and heterospecific photosynthetic neighboring plants. from our dna sequence data, we infer carbon flow from photosynthetic plants to mycoheterotrophic plants through shared glomalean fungal networks. finally, our phylogenetic analyses identify a major glomus clade that forms associations with mycoheterotrophic life cycle stages of b. crenulatum and b. lanceolatum.
environment-sensitive quinolone demonstrating long-lived fluorescence and unusually slow excited-state intramolecular proton transfer kinetics. by using four labels of the 3-hydroxyflavone family displaying selective sensitivity to hydrogen bond (hb) donors and poor response to other polar molecules, we developed an approach for measuring local water concentration [h(2)o](l) (or partial volume of water: w(a) = [h(2)o](l)/55.6) in the label surrounding both in solvent mixtures and in biomolecules by the intensity ratio of two emissive forms of the label, n*/t*. using a series of binary water/solvent mixtures with limited preferential solvation effects, a linear dependence of log(n*/t*) on the local concentration of hb donor was obtained and then used as a calibration curve for estimating the w(a) values in the surroundings of the probes conjugated to biomolecules. by this approach, we estimated the hydration of the labels in different peptides and their complexes with dnas. we found that w(a) values for the label at the peptide n-terminus are lower (0.63-0.91) than for free labels and depend strongly on the nature of the n-terminal amino acid. when complexed with different dnas, the estimated hydration of the labels conjugated to the labeled peptides was much lower (w(a) = 0-0.47) and depended on the dna nature and linker-label structure. thus, the elaborated method allows a site-specific evaluation of hydration at the surface of a biomolecule through the determination of the partial volume of water. we believe the developed procedure can be successfully applied for monitoring hydration at the surface of any biomolecule or nanostructure.
retinal gene therapy despite their physiological roles, müller glial cells are involved directly or indirectly in retinal disease pathogenesis and are an interesting target for therapeutic approaches for retinal diseases and regeneration such as crb1 inherited retinal dystrophies. in this study, we characterized the efficiency of adeno-associated virus (aav) capsid variants and different promoters to drive protein expression in müller glial cells. shh10y and aav9 were the most powerful capsids to infect mouse müller glial cells. retinaldehyde-binding protein 1 (rlbp1) promoter was the most powerful promoter to transduce müller glial cells. shh10y capsids and rlbp1 promoter targeted human müller glial cells in vitro. we also developed and tested smaller promoters to express the large crb1 gene via aav vectors. minimal cytomegalovirus (cmv) promoter allowed expression of full-length crb1 protein in müller glial cells. in summary, shh10y and aav9 capsids, and rlbp1 or minimal cmv promoters are of interest as specific tools to target and express in mouse or human müller glial cells.
the evidence on tiotropium bromide in asthma: from the rationale to the bedside despite current guidelines and the range of available treatments, over a half of patients with asthma continue to suffer from poor symptomatic control and remain at risk of future worsening. although a number of non-pharmacological measures are crucial for good clinical management of asthma, new therapeutic controller medications will have a role in the future management of the disease. several long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilators are under investigation or are available for the treatment of respiratory diseases, including tiotropium bromide, aclidinium bromide, glycopyrronium bromide, glycopyrrolate and umeclidinium bromide, although none is yet licensed for the treatment of asthma. a recent phase iii investigation demonstrated that the once-daily long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilator tiotropium bromide improves lung function and reduces the risk of exacerbation in patients with symptomatic asthma, despite the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ics) and long-acting β2-agonists (labas). this has prompted the question of what the rationale is for long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilators in asthma. bronchial smooth muscle contraction is the primary cause of reversible airway narrowing in asthma, and the baseline level of contraction is predominantly set by the level of ‘cholinergic tone’. patients with asthma have increased bronchial smooth muscle tone and mucus hypersecretion, possibly as a result of elevated cholinergic activity, which anticholinergic compounds are known to reduce. further, anticholinergic compounds may also have anti-inflammatory properties. thus, evidence suggests that long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilators might offer benefits for the maintenance of asthma control, such as in patients failing to gain control on ics and a laba, or those with frequent exacerbations.
annual and diurnal variations of gaseous and particulate pollutants in 31 provincial capital cities based on in situ air quality monitoring data from china national environmental monitoring center. o3 and pm2.5 were introduced into the newly revised air quality standard system in february 2012, representing a milestone in the history of air pollution control, and china's urban air quality will be evaluated using six factors (so2, no2, o3, co, pm2.5 and pm10) from the beginning of 2013. to achieve the new air quality standard, it is extremely important to have a primary understanding of the current pollution status in various cities. the spatial and temporal variations of the air pollutants were investigated in 26 pilot cities in china from august 2011 to february 2012, just before the new standard was executed. hourly averaged so2, no2 and pm10 were observed in 26 cities, and the pollutants o3, co and pm2.5 were measured in 15 of the 26 cities. the concentrations of so2 and co were much higher in the cities in north china than those in the south. as for o3 and no2, however, there was no significant difference between northern and southern cities. fine particles were found to account for a large proportion of airborne particles, with the ratio of pm2.5 to pm10 ranging from 55% to 77%. the concentrations of pm2.5 (57.5 microg/m3) and pm10 (91.2 microg/m3) were much higher than the values (pm2.5: 11.2 microg/m3; pm10: 35.6 microg/m3) recommended by the world health organization. the attainment of the new urban air quality standard in the investigated cities is decreased by 20% in comparison with the older standard without considering o3, co and pm2.5, suggesting a great challenge in urban air quality improvement, and more efforts will to be taken to control air pollution in china.
genome-wide association with c-reactive protein levels in clhns: evidence for the crp and hnf1a loci and their interaction with exposure to a pathogenic environment obesity and infectious agents are both sources of inflammatory stimuli that result in increased production of c-reactive protein (crp). rates of overweight and obesity are increasing globally, but for many populations, gains in body fat are set against a backdrop of high levels of pathogen exposure. our primary objective was to evaluate the extent to which adiposity and pathogenicity contribute to a double burden of inflammation in a population currently undergoing the nutrition transition. measures of adiposity, pathogen exposure, and infectious disease symptoms were evaluated as predictors of high-sensitivity crp concentration in plasma samples from 1875 women participating in the cebu longitudinal health and nutrition survey in the philippines. proxy measures of pathogen exposure included household crowding and cleanliness, quality of water source, mode of waste disposal, and fecal exposure. a series of maximum likelihood logistic regression models were used to predict a plasma crp concentration > 3 mg/l. waist circumference was the strongest anthropometric predictor of elevated crp [odds ratio (or) = 2.29; 95% ci = 2.00, 2.62; p < 0.001]. presence of infectious disease symptoms (or = 2.51; 95% ci = 1.84, 3.44; p < 0.001) and level of pathogen exposure (or = 1.56; 95% ci = 1.15, 2.12; p < 0.01) were also associated with elevated crp. these associations were independent of socioeconomic status and other health behaviors. overweight/obesity and infectious exposures are associated with elevated crp in the philippines; it is likely that other populations undergoing the nutrition transition are experiencing comparable double burdens of inflammatory stimuli. these results underscore the need for additional research on the contributions of pathogenicity, adiposity, and inflammation to global epidemics of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.
the nature and meaning of identity in retired professional women this study examined narrative identity in 2 groups of participants who were younger (ages ranging from late adolescence through young adulthood) and older (over the age of 65 years). participants completed an extensive interview in which they reported three self-defining memories. interviews were coded for several characteristics of autobiographical reasoning: self-event connections representing self-stability or self-change, event-event connections, reflective processing, and thematic coherence. results showed that the older and younger groups were not different in terms of the frequencies of self-event connections or the levels of reflective processing. however, in comparison with the younger group, the older group had more thematic coherence and more stories representing stability, whereas the younger group had more stories representing change. gender differences also emerged, suggesting that females may have an advantage in the development of narrative identity. results are discussed in terms of the different ways to represent narrative identity at 2 ends of the life span.
bioaccumulation and ecotoxicity of carbon nanotubes the present study examined the roles of the specific surface area (ssa), diameter, and length of carbon nanotubes (cnt) on the adsorption of phenanthrene (pnt) by analyzing the adsorption isotherms obtained with several single-walled carbon nanotubes (swnt) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (mwnt). at low equilibrium concentrations (e.g., 1 ppb), mwnts with larger outer diameters exhibited higher pnt adsorption capacity on an ssa basis than those with smaller diameters. with increasing equilibrium concentration, adsorption on an ssa basis became independent of mwnt diameter, and the total surface area controlled maximum adsorption capacity. a similar analysis for the adsorption of naphthalene, a planar molecule with one less benzene ring but 20 times higher solubility than pnt, showed no correlation with respect to mwnt outer diameter. the results indicated that the surface curvature of mwnt was more important on the adsorption of pnt than on the adsorption of naphthalene. specific surface area normalized isotherms did not show a correlation between pnt adsorption and lengths of swnts and mwnts. characterization results indicated that the morphology of cnts plays an important role on the ssa and pore volume. data from the manufacturer may not always represent the characteristics of cnts in a particular batch. therefore, accurate characterization of cnts is critical to systematically examine the behavior of cnts, such as adsorption and transport, in environmental systems.
molecular markers associated with aluminium tolerance in sorghum bicolor aluminum (al) toxicity is the major limiting factor of crop production on acid soils, but some plant species have evolved ways of detoxifying al. here, we report a c2h2-type zinc finger transcription factor art1 (for al resistance transcription factor 1), which specifically regulates the expression of genes related to al tolerance in rice (oryza sativa). art1 is constitutively expressed in the root, and the expression level is not affected by al treatment. art1 is localized in the nucleus of all root cells. a yeast one-hybrid assay showed that art1 has a transcriptional activation potential and interacts with the promoter region of star1, an important factor in rice al tolerance. microarray analysis revealed 31 downstream transcripts regulated by art1, including star1 and 2 and a couple of homologs of al tolerance genes in other plants. some of these genes were implicated in both internal and external detoxification of al at different cellular levels. our findings shed light on comprehensively understanding how plants detoxify aluminum to survive in an acidic environment.
evidence of a latitudinal gradient in the age at onset of schizophrenia abstract evidence from nearly a century of epidemiological research indicates that schizophrenia occcurs in all populations with a prevalence in the range of 1.4 to 4.6 per 1000 and incidence rates in the range of 0.16–0.42 per 1000 population. multi-centre studies conducted by the world health organization have highlighted important differences between ‘western’ and ‘third world’ populations as regards the course and outcome of the disorder, with a significantly better prognosis in the developing countries. the factors underlying the better outcome of schizophrenia in developing countries remain essentially unknown but are likely to involve interactions between genetic variation and specific aspects of the environment. these features place schizophrenia, along with diabetes, cancer and hypertension, into the group of genetically complex diseases which are characterised by polygenic transmission, locus heterogeneity and environmental contribution to causation. the emerging pattern of risk factors and antecedents of schizophrenia suggests multiple, mainly quantitative deviations from the average developmental trajectory, primarily in the areas of early neurodevelopment, cognitive ability and social behaviour. these deviations are compatible with the notion of non-specific background factors facilitating the operation of genetically determined causal pathways. research likely to result in new insights should focus on the population distribution and behavioural effects of potential risk factors and markers suggested by biological and genetic research
glial and neuronal damage markers in patients with anorexia nervosa glial fibrillary acidic protein (gfap), found only in glial cells of the central nervous system (cns) (1)(2), was first isolated by eng et al. (1) in 1971. gfap is a monomeric molecule with a molecular mass between 40 and 53 kda (3)(4) and an isoelectric point between 5.7 and 5.8 (2). gfap represents the major part of the cytoskeleton of astrocytes. dearmond et al. (5) reported on the spontaneous degradation of gfap in vitro and in vivo; under physiological conditions, gfap polymerizes spontaneously to astrofibrils with a length of 0.8–1.06 μm.  numerous reports in the literature document the usefulness of measuring gfap in cerebrospinal fluid (csf) as a specific indicator of cns pathology (6)(7)(8)(9)(10)(11)(12)(13). measuring gfap in blood would have clinical advantages over csf measurements; however, to our knowledge, the only method attempted to date to measure gfap in blood (14) was not successful.  we describe the results of measuring the concentrations of both gfap and s-100 protein in the blood of patients with acute severe head trauma and healthy controls, using the dissociation-enhanced lanthanide fluorescence immunoassay (delfia) system for detection of gfap (delfia can also be used to measure the concentration of gfap in csf).  blood samples were obtained from 25 patients (19 males and 6 females; ages, 16–72 years; mean age, 38.6 ± 19.0 years) who were admitted <24 h after severe head trauma (a glasgow coma scale score of ≤6 on admission). three samples were obtained from each patient: the first sample was obtained on admission to the hospital, the second was obtained 24 h after the head injury, and the third was obtained 48 h after the injury.  blood samples were also obtained from 70 healthy blood donors …
prevalence and severity of ocular surface neoplasia in african nations and need for early interventions objective to examine the reliability of clinical examination and in vivo confocal microscopy (ivcm) in distinguishing ocular surface squamous neoplasia (ossn) from benign conjunctival lesions. design case-control study. participants sixty individuals with conjunctival lesions (ossn and benign) and 60 age-matched controls with normal conjunctiva presenting to kilimanjaro christian medical centre, moshi, tanzania. methods participants were examined and photographed, and ivcm was performed. patients with conjunctival lesions were offered excisional biopsy with histopathology and a human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) test. the ivcm images were read masked to the clinical appearance and pathology results. images were graded for several specific features and given an overall categorization (normal, benign, or malignant). a group of 8 ophthalmologists were shown photographs of conjunctival lesions and asked to independently classify as ossn or benign. main outcome measures comparison of the histopathology diagnosis with the clinical and ivcm diagnosis. results fifty-two cases underwent excisional biopsy with histopathology; 34 were on the ossn spectrum, 17 were benign, and 1 was lymphoma. the cases and controls had comparable demographic profiles. human immunodeficiency syndrome infection was more common in ossn compared with benign cases (58.8% vs. 5.6%; odds ratio, 24.3, 95% confidence interval [ci], 2.8–204; p = 0.003). clinically, ossn lesions more frequently exhibited feeder vessels and tended to have more leukoplakia and a gelatinous appearance. overall, the ophthalmologists showed moderate agreement with the histology result (average kappa = 0.51; 95% ci, 0.36–0.64). the masked grading of ivcm images reliably distinguished normal conjunctiva. however, ivcm was unable to reliably distinguish between benign lesions and ossn because of an overlap in their appearance (kappa = 0.44; 95% ci, 0.32–0.57). no single feature was significantly more frequent in ossn compared with benign lesions. the sensitivity and specificity of ivcm for distinguishing ossn from benign conjunctival lesions were 38.5% and 66.7%, respectively. conclusions in east africa, conjunctival pathology is relatively common and can present significant diagnostic challenges for the clinician. in this study, neither clinical examination nor ivcm was found to reliably distinguish ossn from benign conjunctival pathology because of an overlap in the features of these groups. therefore, ivcm cannot currently replace histopathology, and management decisions should continue to rely on careful clinical assessment supported by histopathology as indicated.
provenance-based reproducibility in the semantic web through technologies such as rss (really simple syndication), web services, and ajax (asynchronous javascript and xml), the internet has facilitated the emergence of applications that are composed from a variety of services and data sources. through tools such as yahoo pipes, these “mash-ups” can be composed in a dynamic, just-in-time manner from components provided by multiple institutions (i.e., google, amazon, your neighbor). however, when using these applications, it is not apparent where data comes from or how it is processed. thus, to inspire trust and confidence in mash-ups, it is critical to be able to analyze their processes after the fact. these trailing analyses, in particular the determination of the provenance of a result (i.e., the process that led to it), are enabled by process documentation, which is documentation of an application's past process created by the components of that application at execution time. in this article, we define a generic conceptual data model that supports the autonomous creation of attributable, factual process documentation for dynamic multi-institutional applications. the data model is instantiated using two internet formats, owl and xml, and is evaluated with respect to questions about the provenance of results generated by a complex bioinformatics mash-up.
frugivory in polychrotid lizards: effects of body size animal diets crucially affect fitness, yet many aspects of their ultimate determinants are unknown. the distribution and extent of herbivory in lizards, its evolutionary history, and ecological factors that may favour it are discussed. most lizards are exclusively or primarily carnivorous, yet many species eat some plants and a few are almost exclusively herbivorous. based on a literature survey of diets of over 450 lizard species, the distribution and degree of omnivory and herbivory are described. some plants occur in the diets of slightly over half of lizard species, and plants formed 10% or more of the dietary volume of 12.1% of species, and 90% or more of the diet of 0.8% of species. the greatest percentage of omnivorous species (> 10% plant diet), over 30% in each, and highest mean percentage plant matter in the diet are in iguanidae, corytophanidae, gerrhosauridae, agamidae, xantusiidae, and tropiduridae. numerous other omnivores occur in lacertidae and scincidae and fewer in several additional families. herbivorous lizards (> 90% plant volume) tend to be folivorous and to possess adaptations for processing leaves, including specialized dentition for cutting or reducing leaves, elongated intestines, colic valves that slow passage of food, and intestinal flora that digest cellulose. omnivorous lizards lacking such specializations may eat some leaves, but consume much more fruit, flowers, and seeds, plant parts that are easy to digest, likely to be very abundant seasonally, and may be highly nutritious. some lizards eat nectar and pollen; even sap is eaten by at least one gecko. ontogenetic increase in plant consumption and decrease in prey consumption is known, but its generality has been controversial. such ontogeny has been demonstrated in three iguanid species, a skink, a lacertid, two tropidurids, a phrynosomatid, and two corytophanids, but it does not occur in some other species. thus, the presences of ontogenetic variation must be evaluated for each species. the importance of specific foods may also vary with age. omnivory and/or herbivory have originated in many lizard families, with at least nine origins in iguania and 23 in scleroglossa. origins have been rare in gekkonoidea and anguimorpha and common in scincomorpha, especially in lacertidae and scincidae. losses of omnivory have been much less frequent than gains. only a few origins can account for all the herbivory in lizards. concentrated changes tests show that there is a significant association in lacertidae, lacertiformes, lacertoidea, scincidae, and scleroglossa between insularity and omnivory. insular lizards may broaden their diets to compensate for limited availability of prey. addition of other factors that reduce availability of prey, i.e. extreme aridity and cave-dwelling, to insularity, strengthened the relationship to omnivory in lacertidae and lacertoidea. we were unable to demonstrate a role of aridity independent of insularity, but present anecdotal evidence suggests that it may promote evolution of plant consumption. large body size in lizards has long been associated with herbivory, and more recently, with omnivory in lacertid lizards. using a conventional regression approach in which each species is considered to supply an independent data point, this relationship was confirmed for all lizards. although larger species have diets with more plants, plant consumption accounts for only 9% of the variation in body length, which is not surprising given that other factors such as predation, competition, and sexual selection affect body size. the frequency of transitions body size associated with transitions to ominivory or carnivory was also examined. in iguania, scleroglossa, and all lizards, transitions supporting the hypothesis that omnivory favours increase in body size were significantly more frequent than nonsupporting transitions. this suggests that substantial plant consumption favours evolution of larger size, probably because of the energetic considerations first presented by pough (1973). because actively foraging lizards move widely through the habitat to locate prey and tongue-flick to locate prey by chemical cues, we
retracted: fmn2 makes perinuclear actin to protect nuclei during conﬁned migration and promote metastasis the actin cytoskeleton is essential for diverse processes in mammalian cells; these processes range from establishing cell polarity to powering cell migration to driving cytokinesis to positioning intracellular organelles. how these many functions are carried out in a spatiotemporally regulated manner in a single cytoplasm has been the subject of much study in the cytoskeleton field. recent work has identified a host of actin nucleation factors that can build architecturally diverse actin structures. the biochemical properties of these factors, coupled with their cellular location, likely define the functional properties of actin structures. in this article, we describe how recent advances in cell biology and biochemistry have begun to elucidate the role of individual actin nucleation factors in generating distinct cellular structures. we also consider how the localization and orientation of actin nucleation factors, in addition to their kinetic properties, are critical to their ability to build a functional actin cytoskeleton.
retinal axonal loss begins early in the course of multiple sclerosis and is similar between progressive phenotypes clinically isolated syndromes (cis), such as optic neuritis, brainstem or spinal cord syndromes are frequently the first clinical presentations of multiple sclerosis. however, not all cis patients develop multiple sclerosis and in those who do, disability is highly variable. in previous follow-up studies, brain lesions on t2-weighted mri are associated with increased risk of multiple sclerosis and to an extent disability. we evaluated the longitudinal relationships between the mri lesions and clinical course over a period of 20 years. cis patients were recruited between 1984 and 1987 and previously followed up after 1, 5, 10 and 14 years. of the 140 subjects who were initially recruited with a cis for a baseline mri study, we followed up 107 patients after a mean of 20.2 years (range 18-27.7). multiple sclerosis was diagnosed as clinically definite on clinical grounds only and disability determined using the expanded disability status scale (edss) and multiple sclerosis functional composite (msfc) score. clinically definite multiple sclerosis developed in 67 out of 107 (63%) overall: 60 out of 73 (82%) with abnormal and 7 out of 34 (21%) with normal baseline mri. multiple sclerosis was still relapsing-remitting in 39 (58%)--including 26 (39%) with a 'benign' course (edss < or = 3)--whilst 28 (42%) had developed secondary progression. t2 lesion volume at all time-points correlated moderately with 20-year edss (r(s) values 0.48 to 0.67; p < 0.001) and msfc z-score [r(s) values (-0.50) to (-0.61); p < 0.001]. in those developing multiple sclerosis, a concurrent correlation of change in t2 lesion volume with change in edss was most evident in years 0-5 (r(s) = 0.69, p < 0.001). the estimated rate of lesion growth over 20 years was 0.80 cm3/year in those who retained a relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis course, and 2.89 cm3/year in those who developed secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, a difference of 2.09 cm3/year (95% ci: 0.77, 2.96; p < 0.001). this study extends previous follow-up of cis patients and sheds new light on how the lesions evolve according to the natural history. baseline mri findings are predictive for development of clinically definite multiple sclerosis. lesion volume and its change at earlier time points are correlated with disability after 20 years. lesion volume increases for at least 20 years in relapse-onset multiple sclerosis and the rate of lesion growth is three times higher in those who develop secondary progressive than in those who remain relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.
preprint anl/mcs-p795-0200 nonlinear programs with unbounded lagrange multiplier sets we show that an interior-point method for monotone variational inequalities exhibits superlinear convergence provided that all the standard assumptions hold except for the well-known assumption that the jacobian of the active constraints has full rank at the solution. we show that superlinear convergence occurs even when the constant-rank condition on the jacobian assumed in an earlier work does not hold.
celljoin: a parallel stream join operator for the cell processor we present an adaptive load shedding approach for windowed stream joins. in contrast to the conventional approach of dropping tuples from the input streams, we explore the concept ofselective processing for load shedding. we allow stream tuples to be stored in the windows and shed excessive cpu load by performing the join operations, not on the entire set of tuples within the windows, but on a dynamically changing subset of tuples that are learned to be highly beneficial. we support such dynamic selective processing through three forms of runtimeadaptations: adaptation to input stream rates, adaptation to time correlation between the streams and adaptation to join directions. our load shedding approach enables us to integrateutility-based load shedding withtime correlation-based load shedding. indexes are used to further speed up the execution of stream joins. experiments are conducted to evaluate our adaptive load shedding in terms of output rate and utility. the results show that our selective processing approach to load shedding is very effective and significantly outperforms the approach that drops tuples from the input streams.
rice osfls2-mediated perception of bacterial flagellins is evaded by xanthomonas oryzae pvs. oryzae and oryzicola. the bacterial flagellin (flic) epitopes flg22 and flgii-28 are microbe-associated molecular patterns (mamps). although flg22 is recognized by many plant species via the pattern recognition receptor fls2, neither the flgii-28 receptor nor the extent of flgii-28 recognition by different plant families is known. here, we tested the significance of flgii-28 as a mamp and the importance of allelic diversity in flg22 and flgii-28 in plant-pathogen interactions using purified peptides and a pseudomonas syringae ∆flic mutant complemented with different flic alleles. the plant genotype and allelic diversity in flg22 and flgii-28 were found to significantly affect the plant immune response, but not bacterial motility. the recognition of flgii-28 is restricted to a number of solanaceous species. although the flgii-28 peptide does not trigger any immune response in arabidopsis, mutations in both flg22 and flgii-28 have fls2-dependent effects on virulence. however, the expression of a tomato allele of fls2 does not confer to nicotiana benthamiana the ability to detect flgii-28, and tomato plants silenced for fls2 are not altered in flgii-28 recognition. therefore, mamp diversification is an effective pathogen virulence strategy, and flgii-28 appears to be perceived by an as yet unidentified receptor in the solanaceae, although it has an fls2-dependent virulence effect in arabidopsis.
between-trial inhibition and facilitation in goal-directed aiming: manual and spatial asymmetries consistent with action–based theories of attention, the presence of a nontarget stimulus in the environment has been shown to alter the characteristics of goal–directed movements. specifically, it has been reported that movement trajectories veer away from (howard & tipper, 1997) or towards (welsh, elliott, & weeks, 1999) the location of a nontarget stimulus. the purpose of the experiments reported in this paper was to test a response activation model of selective reaching conceived to account for these variable results. in agreement with the model, the trajectory changes in the movements appear to be determined by the activation levels of each competing response at the moment of response initiation. the results of the present work, as well as those of previous studies, are discussed within the framework of the model of response activation.
azd5363 inhibits inflammatory synergy between interleukin-17 and insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 the il-17 receptor triggers dual, sequential phosphorylation of the transcription factor c/ebpβ, which represses the expression of target genes. getting negative interleukin 17 (il-17) is a proinflammatory cytokine that is important in mediating immune responses to infectious organisms. in addition, il-17 plays a critical role in the pathology of autoimmune disorders. recently, an il-17–secreting population of t cells, termed t helper 17 (th17), has been identified as a distinct t cell lineage, stimulating interest in the properties of these cells and the signaling mechanisms of il-17. il-17 signals through a receptor complex consisting of il-17ra and il-17rc subunits, which have several structural features that distinguish them from other cytokine receptors. signaling through il-17ra leads to the activation of the transcription factors nf-κb, c/ebpδ, and c/ebpβ. although il-17ra–mediated activation of nf-κb and c/ebpδ is well understood, how il-17 regulates the activity of c/ebpβ is unclear. shen et al. used tandem mass spectrometry and other experiments to show that il-17ra signaling led to the sequential, dual phosphorylation of c/ebpβ. whereas the first phosphorylation event depended on the activity of extracellular signal–regulated kinase, the second depended on that of glycogen synthase kinase 3β. phosphorylation of c/ebpβ resulted in repressed expression of il-17 target genes, the first characterized negative consequence of il-17r signaling. interleukin-17 (il-17), the hallmark cytokine of t helper 17 (th17) cells, signals through a distinct receptor subclass, yet little is known about the mechanisms involved. il-17 activates the expression of target genes through the actions of the transcription factors nuclear factor κb (nf-κb), caat enhancer binding protein δ (c/ebpδ), and c/ebpβ. the adaptor proteins tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 6 (traf6) and act1 are upstream of nf-κb and c/ebpδ, but the regulation of c/ebpβ remains undefined. here, we show that il-17 signaling led to phosphorylation of two sites in the regulatory 2 domain of c/ebpβ in a sequential, interdependent fashion. the first was rapid and dependent on extracellular signal–regulated kinase (erk), whereas the second was dependent on the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (gsk-3β). these pathways were mediated by distinct subdomains within il-17 receptor a (il-17ra). whereas phosphorylation of threonine 188 (thr188) was mediated by the previously identified sef/il-17r homology domain–toll-il-1r–like loop (sefir-till), phosphorylation of thr179 occurred through a newly characterized motif located in the distal tail of il-17ra. phosphorylated c/ebpβ mediated a negative signal, because blocking erk and gsk-3β increased expression of il-17 target genes and a c/ebpβ-thr188 mutant enhanced activation of a c/ebp-dependent reporter. overexpression of gsk-3β inhibited il-17–induced activation of a c/ebp-dependent reporter, and thr179 of c/ebpβ was not phosphorylated in gsk-3β–deficient cells. thus, il-17 triggered the dual phosphorylation of c/ebpβ, which inhibited the expression of proinflammatory genes. this detailed dissection is the first for the il-17–mediated c/ebp pathway and the first known example of a negative signal mediated by il-17ra.
widening operators for weakly-relational numeric abstractions a program denotes computations in some universe of objects. abstract interpretation of programs consists in using that denotation to describe computations in another universe of abstract objects, so that the results of abstract execution give some information on the actual computations. an intuitive example (which we borrow from sintzoff [72]) is the rule of signs. the text -1515 * 17 may be understood to denote computations on the abstract universe {(+), (-), (±)} where the semantics of arithmetic operators is defined by the rule of signs. the abstract execution -1515 * 17 → -(+) * (+) → (-) * (+) → (-), proves that -1515 * 17 is a negative number. abstract interpretation is concerned by a particular underlying structure of the usual universe of computations (the sign, in our example). it gives a summary of some facets of the actual executions of a program. in general this summary is simple to obtain but inaccurate (e.g. -1515 + 17 → -(+) + (+) → (-) + (+) → (±)). despite its fundamentally incomplete results abstract interpretation allows the programmer or the compiler to answer questions which do not need full knowledge of program executions or which tolerate an imprecise answer, (e.g. partial correctness proofs of programs ignoring the termination problems, type checking, program optimizations which are not carried in the absence of certainty about their feasibility, …).
optimal multi-drug approaches for reduction of the latent pool in hiv importance new data and antiretroviral regimens expand treatment choices in resource-rich settings and warrant an update of recommendations to treat adults infected with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv).   objective to provide updated treatment recommendations for adults with hiv, emphasizing when to start treatment; what treatment to start; the use of laboratory monitoring tools; and managing treatment failure, switches, and simplification.   data sources, study selection, and data synthesis an international antiviral society-usa panel of experts in hiv research and patient care considered previous data and reviewed new data since the 2012 update with literature searches in pubmed and embase through june 2014. recommendations and ratings were based on the quality of evidence and consensus.   results antiretroviral therapy is recommended for all adults with hiv infection. evidence for benefits of treatment and quality of available data increase at lower cd4 cell counts. recommended initial regimens include 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nrtis; abacavir/lamivudine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine) and a third single or boosted drug, which should be an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (dolutegravir, elvitegravir, or raltegravir), a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (efavirenz or rilpivirine) or a boosted protease inhibitor (darunavir or atazanavir). alternative regimens are available. boosted protease inhibitor monotherapy is generally not recommended, but nrti-sparing approaches may be considered. new guidance for optimal timing of monitoring of laboratory parameters is provided. suspected treatment failure warrants rapid confirmation, performance of resistance testing while the patient is receiving the failing regimen, and evaluation of reasons for failure before consideration of switching therapy. regimen switches for adverse effects, convenience, or to reduce costs should not jeopardize antiretroviral potency.   conclusions and relevance after confirmed diagnosis of hiv infection, antiretroviral therapy should be initiated in all individuals who are willing and ready to start treatment. regimens should be selected or changed based on resistance test results with consideration of dosing frequency, pill burden, adverse toxic effect profiles, comorbidities, and drug interactions.
inborn errors of metabolism and the human interactome: a systems medicine approach given the functional interdependencies between the molecular components in a human cell, a disease is rarely a consequence of an abnormality in a single gene, but reflects the perturbations of the complex intracellular and intercellular network that links tissue and organ systems. the emerging tools of network medicine offer a platform to explore systematically not only the molecular complexity of a particular disease, leading to the identification of disease modules and pathways, but also the molecular relationships among apparently distinct (patho)phenotypes. advances in this direction are essential for identifying new disease genes, for uncovering the biological significance of disease-associated mutations identified by genome-wide association studies and full-genome sequencing, and for identifying drug targets and biomarkers for complex diseases.
key-recovery attacks on universal hash function based mac algorithms we describe a message authentication algorithm, umac, which can authenticate messages (in software, on contemporary machines) roughly an order of magnitude faster than current practice (e.g., hmac-sha1), and about twice as fast as times previously reported for the universal hash-function family mmh. to achieve such speeds, umac uses a new universal hash-function family, nh, and a design which allows effective exploitation of simd parallelism. the "cryptographic" work of umac is done using standard primitives of the user's choice, such as a block cipher or cryptographic hash function; no new heuristic primitives are developed here. instead, the security of umac is rigorously proven, in the sense of giving exact and quantitatively strong results which demonstrate an inability to forge umac-authenticated messages assuming an inability to break the underlying cryptographic primitive. unlike conventional, inherently serial macs, umac is parallelizable, and will have ever-faster implementation speeds as machines offer up increasing amounts of parallelism. we envision umac as a practical algorithm for next-generation message authentication.
hand function is impaired in healthy older adults at risk of parkinson’s disease in recent studies, we have found a marked increase in substantia nigra (sn) echogenicity in patients with parkinson's disease (pd) using transcranial ultrasound. because a substantial body of evidence has accumulated indicating a selective elevation of iron in the sn from patients with pd, we set out to test the hypothesis that trace metals like iron could lead to the observed increase of sn echogenicity in pd. rat brains were scanned after stereotactic injection of iron in different concentrations into the sn and after injecting ferritin, zinc and 6-ohda alone, and after the addition of desferrioxamine. the amount of iron in the sn was measured spectroscopically. for iron, and partly for 6-ohda, in different concentrations, a dose-dependent increase of sn echogenicity could be visualized, corresponding to an increase of iron measured by spectroscopy. no increase of echogenicity was visualized after the injection of ferritin and the addition of desferrioxamine to 6-ohda, though an increase of iron was measured by spectroscopy. therefore, we conclude that iron not bound to these proteins may lead to an increase of echogenicity of the sn.
layer-specific interference with cholinergic signaling in the prefrontal cortex by smoking concentrations of nicotine adolescence is a critical period of brain development during which maturation of areas involved in cognitive functioning, such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mpfc), is still ongoing. tobacco smoking during this age can compromise the normal course of prefrontal development and lead to cognitive impairments in later life. recently, we reported that nicotine exposure during adolescence results in a short-term increase and lasting reduction in synaptic mglur2 levels in the rat mpfc, causing attention deficits during adulthood. it is unknown how changed synaptic mglur2 levels after adolescent nicotine exposure affect the ability of mpfc synapses to undergo long-term synaptic plasticity. here, we addressed this question. to model nicotine exposure, adolescent (p34–p43) or adult (p60–p69) rats were treated with nicotine injections three times per day for 10 d. we found that, both during acute activation of nicotinic receptors in the adolescent mpfc as well as immediately following nicotine treatment during adolescence, long-term plasticity in response to timed presynaptic and postsynaptic activity (tltp) was strongly reduced. in contrast, in the mpfc of adult rats 5 weeks after they received nicotine treatment during adolescence, but not during adulthood, tltp was increased. short- and long-term adaptation of mpfc synaptic plasticity after adolescent nicotine exposure could be explained by changed mglur2 signaling. blocking mglur2s augmented tltp, whereas activating mglur2s reduced tltp. our findings suggest neuronal mechanisms by which exposure to nicotine during adolescence alters the rules for spike timing-dependent plasticity in prefrontal networks that may explain the observed deficits in cognitive performance in later life.
phytochemical extraction, characterisation and comparative distribution across four mango (mangifera indica l.) fruit varieties. kale is a member of the brassicaceae family and has a complex profile of flavonoid glycosides. therefore, kale is a suitable matrix to discuss in a comprehensive study the different fragmentation patterns of flavonoid glycosides. the wide variety of glycosylation and acylation patterns determines the health-promoting effects of these glycosides. the aim of this study is to investigate the naturally occurring flavonoids in kale. a total of 71 flavonoid glycosides of quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin were identified using a high-performance liquid chromatography diode-array detection/electrospray ionization multi-stage mass spectrometry (hplc-dad/esi-ms(n)) method. of these 71 flavonol glycosides, 27 were non-acylated, 30 were monoacylated and 14 were diacylated. non-acylated flavonol glycosides were present as mono-, di-, tri- and tetraglycosides. this is the first time that the occurrence of four different fragmentation patterns of non-acylated flavonol triglycosides has been reported in one matrix simultaneously. in addition, 44 flavonol glycosides were acylated with p-coumaric, caffeic, ferulic, hydroxyferulic or sinapic acid. while monoacylated glycosides existed as di-, tri- and tetraglycosides, diacylated glycosides occurred as tetra- and pentaglycosides. to the best of our knowledge, 28 compounds in kale are reported here for the first time. these include three acylated isorhamnetin glycosides (isorhamnetin-3-o-sinapoyl-sophoroside-7-o-d-glucoside, isorhamnetin-3-o-feruloyl-sophoroside-7-o-diglucoside and isorhamnetin-3-o-disinapoyl-triglucoside-7-o-diglucoside) and seven non-acylated isorhamnetin glycosides.
"brcaness" syndrome in ovarian cancer: a case-control study describing the clinical features and outcome of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer associated with brca1 and brca2 mutations. purpose to study the role of brca mutations in ovarian cancer survival.   patients and methods blood samples and specimens of ovarian tumors (whenever blood samples were not available) at the time of the primary surgery were obtained in the course of a nationwide case-control study of women with ovarian cancer in israel. the three common brca mutations in israel (185delag, 5382insc, and 6174delt) were analyzed with a multiplex polymerase chain reaction to amplify the exons containing the three mutations using fluor-labeled primers in a single reaction. because each mutation is a small insertion or deletion, they can be detected as length polymorphisms. patients were followed for up to 5 years (range, 20 to 64 months). statistical analysis was performed using the kaplan-meier method and the log-rank test. stepwise cox regression analysis was used for determination of independent prognostic factors.   results this report is based on 896 blood or tumor specimens analyzed for the presence of the brca mutations. of these, 234 women (26.1%) were found to be positive. a significant difference in survival pattern was found between brca1/brca2 carriers and noncarriers among the women with invasive ovarian cancer (median survival, 53.4 months v. 37.8 months; 3-year survival, 65.8% v. 51.9%, respectively). these differences were independent of age at diagnosis or stage of the disease.   conclusion our data indicate that the survival of patients with ovarian cancer is affected by brca germline mutation, at least in the early years after diagnosis.
a disturbance-induced increase in tree species diversity facilitates forest productivity disturbance has many effects on ecological communities, and it is often suggested that disturbance can affect species diversity by altering competitive outcomes. however, disturbance regimes have many distinct aspects that may act, and interact, to influence species diversity. while there are many theoretical models of disturbance-prone communities, few have specifically documented how interactions between different aspects of a disturbance regime change competitive outcomes. here, we present a model of two plant species subject to disturbance which we then use to examine species coexistence over varying levels of two aspects of disturbance: frequency, and spatial extent (i.e., area disturbed). we show that the competitive outcome is affected differently by changes in each aspect and that the effect of disturbance frequency on species coexistence depends strongly on the spatial extent of the disturbance, and vice versa. we classify the nature of these interactions between disturbance frequency and extent on the basis of the shape of the resulting coexistence regions in a frequency–extent parameter plane. our results illustrate that different types of interaction can result from differences in life-history traits that control species-specific sensitivity to frequency and extent of disturbance. thus, our analysis shows that the various aspects of disturbance must be carefully considered in concert with the life-history traits of the community members in order to assess the consequences of disturbance.
bond-graph modeling in modelica ™ modelling and simulation have become endeavours central to all disciplines of science and engineering. they are used in the analysis of physical systems where they help us gain a better understanding of the functioning of our physical world. they are also important to the design of new engineering systems where they enable us to predict the behaviour of a system before it is ever actually built. modelling and simulation are the only techniques available that allow us to analyze arbitrarily non-linear systems accurately and under varying experimental conditions. the two books "modeling and simulation of continuous systems," of which this is the first, introduce the student to an important subclass of these techniques. they deal with the analysis of systems described through a set of ordinary or partial differential equations or through a set of difference equations. this first volume introduces concepts of modelling physical systems through a set of differential and/or difference equations. the purpose is twofold: it enhances the scientific understanding of our physical world by codifying (organizing) knowledge about this world, and it supports engineering design by allowing the reader to assess the consequences of a particular design alternative before it is actually built. this text has a flavour of the mathematical discipline of dynamical systems, and is strongly orientated towards newtonian physical science.
real wage, labor productivity, and employment trends in south africa: a closer look using multivariate cointegration and error-correction modeling techniques, this paper attempts to examine whether there exists a productivity-wageunemployment relationship in malaysia at the macroeconomic level. the main findings show that unemployment is dichotomized from the long-run equilibrium relationship between labor productivity and real wages, implying labor productivity is an important long-run factor in determining real wages, while unemployment has negligible effect on the real wage rates. however, the real wages are very responsive to a change in labor productivity, signaling the labor market is tight that leads to an increase in unit labor cost. to be more resilient to rising wages and productivity gap in a globally competitive environment, the malaysian industries should move up the value chain, and promote skill- and technology-intensive production.
scavenger receptor class a plays a central role in mediating mortality and the development of the pro-inflammatory phenotype in polymicrobial sepsis the innate immune response is the first line of defence against infectious disease. the principal challenge for the host is to detect the pathogen and mount a rapid defensive response. a group of proteins that comprise the toll or toll-like family of receptors perform this role in vertebrate and invertebrate organisms. this reflects a remarkable conservation of function and it is therefore not surprising that studies of the mechanism by which they act has revealed new and important insights into host defence.
distinct modulation of the endocannabinoid system upon kainic acid-induced in vivo seizures and in vitro epileptiform bursting considerable progress has been made, recently, in understanding the role of the endocannabinoid system in regard to neuroprotection. endogenous cannabinoids have received increasing attention as potential protective agents in several cases of neuronal injury. the endocannabinoid system is comprised of cannabinoid receptors (cb1 and cb2), their endogenous ligands (endocannabinoids) and proteins responsible for their metabolism. endocannabinoids serve as retrograde signalling messengers in gabaergic and glutamatergic synapses, as well as modulators of post‐synaptic transmission, interacting with other neurotransmitters, including norepinephrine and dopamine. furthermore, endocannabinoids modulate neuronal, glial and endothelial cell function and exert neuromodulatory, anti‐excitotoxic, anti‐inflammatory and vasodilatory effects. physiological stimuli and pathological conditions lead to differential increases in brain endocannabinoids that regulate distinct biological functions. the purpose of this review is to present the available in vivo and in vitro experimental data, up to date, regarding the endocannabinoid system and its role in neuroprotection, as well as its possible therapeutic perspectives. copyright © 2013 john wiley & sons, ltd.
determinants of preference for lesser-known species among cabinet-makers in oyo and osun states, nigeria olivia has extensive forests. many of these forests have been mined for three species of timber: mahogany (swietenia macrophylla), spanish cedar (cedrela odorata), and south american oak (amburana cearensis). extraction of these timber species has helped the bolivian economy generate foreign exchange and cope with past economic crises. however, the sector is now faced with a new challenge: the forests of boliviaareunable tosupply international markets with traditional species due to previous high levels of extraction. the forestry sector needs to utilize more of the “other” timber species. if products utilizing these species are not developed, bolivia’s forestland will likely be converted to other uses, and the potential for bolivia to remain a major tropical wood producer will be lost.
in vivo cell reprogramming towards pluripotency by virus-free overexpression of defined factors we evaluated the teratoma-forming propensity of secondary neurospheres (sns) generated from 36 mouse induced pluripotent stem (ips) cell lines derived in 11 different ways. teratoma-formation of sns from embryonic fibroblast–derived ips cells was similar to that of sns from embryonic stem (es) cells. in contrast, sns from ips cells derived from different adult tissues varied substantially in their teratoma-forming propensity, which correlated with the persistence of undifferentiated cells.
mechanisms of pathogenesis in chagas disease chagas' disease is a major health problem in latin america, where it constitutes one of the leading causes of heart failure. about one fourth of trypanosoma cruzi-infected individuals develop chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy (cchc), the most severe form of the disease. cchc is histologically characterized by the presence of multifocal inflammatory infiltrates in the heart, composed mainly by mononuclear cells, usually adhered to myocytes and leading to myocytolysis, and frequently by interstitial fibrosis. the pathogenesis of cchc is still unclear, despite intense investigations both in human beings and in animal models of the disease. although tissue parasitism is rare in the chronic phase of infection, an immune response targeted to persistent parasites or parasite antigens is suggested, by some authors, as the pathogenic mechanism of cchc. other researchers affirm that the lack of correlation between tissue parasitism and intensity of inflammation suggests, along with the presence of autoreactive immune responses, that cchc results from the action of an autoimmune response. herein we review reports from the literature and our own data, which together indicate, on one hand, the participation of parasite-specific immune responses and, on the other hand, clearly demonstrate the participation of heart-specific immune responses in the pathogenesis of cchc. moreover, multiple factors may determine whether an individual in the indeterminate form of the disease will develop cchc. the mechanisms by which t. cruzi breaks immunological tolerance to heart antigens are also discussed.
rip3 knockdown rescues photoreceptor cell death in blind pde6c zebrafish rod and cone photoreceptor neurons utilize discrete pde6 enzymes that are crucial for phototransduction. rod pde6 is composed of heterodimeric catalytic subunits (αβ), while the catalytic core of cone pde6 (α′) is a homodimer. it is not known if variations between pde6 subunits preclude rod pde6 catalytic subunits from coupling to the cone phototransduction pathway. to study this issue, we generated a cone-dominated mouse model lacking cone pde6 (nrl−/− cpfl1). in this animal model, using several independent experimental approaches, we demonstrated the expression of rod pde6 (αβ) and the absence of cone pde6 (α′) catalytic subunits. the rod pde6 enzyme expressed in cone cells is active and contributes to the hydrolysis of cgmp in response to light. in addition, rod pde6 expressed in cone cells couples to the light signaling pathway to produce s-cone responses. however, s-cone responses and light-dependent cgmp hydrolysis were eliminated when the β-subunit of rod pde6 was removed (nrl−/− cpfl1 rd). we conclude that either rod or cone pde6 can effectively couple to the cone phototransduction pathway to mediate visual signaling. interestingly, we also found that functional pde6 is required for trafficking of m-opsin to cone outer segments.
surgical management of charcot deformity for the foot and ankle-radiologic outcome after internal/external fixation. involvement of the ankle joint in charcot osteoarthropathy may be associated with severe instability and fracture or collapse of the talus. recalcitrant ulceration may result over the lateral malleolus, increasing the risk of major amputation. this study evaluated ankle arthrodesis with a compressive intramedullary nail in 14 patients with diabetes affected by charcot of the ankle. the mean patient age was 58 +/- 12 years, and the mean duration of diabetes was 17 +/- 5 years. transcutaneous oxygen pressures were > or = 50 mm hg in all patients, indicating a good distal blood supply. a below-knee amputation had previously been suggested because of severe ankle joint instability. none of the patients were able to walk without a brace. four patients had an ulceration that had healed before the index procedure. all procedures were performed in the quiescent phase of the disease. after a mean follow-up of 18 +/- 4 months, 10 patients (71.4%) achieved a solid arthrodesis, returning to walking with protective shoes. three patients (21.4%) developed breakage of the calcaneus screws, necessitating removal of the screws in 2 cases and removal of the entire nail in 2 cases. these 3 patients went on to fibrous union that allowed walking with a brace. one patient (7.2%) required a below-knee amputation because of postoperative osteomyelitis of the distal tibia. the data from our study demonstrate a high rate of limb salvage (92.8%), suggesting that this device is safe and effective in the treatment of charcot arthropathy of the ankle.
role of the c-type lectin receptors mcl and dcir in experimental colitis signalling c‐type lectin receptors (clrs) are crucial in shaping the immune response to fungal pathogens, but comparably little is known about the role of these receptors in bacterial, viral and parasitic infections. clrs have many diverse functions depending on the signalling motifs in their cytoplasmic domains, and can induce endocytic, phagocytic, antimicrobial, pro‐inflammatory or anti‐inflammatory responses which are either protective or not during an infection. understanding the role of clrs in shaping anti‐microbial immunity offers great potential for the future development of therapeutics for disease intervention. in this review we will focus on the recognition of bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens by clrs, and how these receptors influence the outcome of infection. we will also provide a brief update on the role of clrs in antifungal immunity.
comparative myoanatomy of cycliophoran life cycle stages summary insight into the origin and early evolution of the animal phyla requires an understanding of how animal groups are related to one another. thus, we set out to explore animal phylogeny by analyzing with maximum parsimony 138 morphological characters from 40 metazoan groups, and 304 18s rdna sequences, both separately and together. both types of data agree that arthropods are not closely related to annelids: the former group with nematodes and other molting animals (ecdysozoa), and the latter group with molluscs and other taxa with spiral cleavage. furthermore, neither brachiopods nor chaetognaths group with deuterostomes; brachiopods are allied with the molluscs and annelids (lophotrochozoa), whereas chaetognaths are allied with the ecdysozoans. the major discordance between the two types of data concerns the rooting of the bilaterians, and the bilaterian sister‐taxon. morphology suggests that the root is between deuterostomes and protostomes, with ctenophores the bilaterian sister‐group, whereas 18s rdna suggests that the root is within the lophotrochozoa with acoel flatworms and gnathostomulids as basal bilaterians, and with cnidarians the bilaterian sister‐group. we suggest that this basal position of acoels and gnathostomulids is artifactal because for 1000 replicate phylogenetic analyses with one random sequence as outgroup, the majority root with an acoel flatworm or gnathostomulid as the basal ingroup lineage. when these problematic taxa are eliminated from the matrix, the combined analysis suggests that the root lies between the deuterostomes and protostomes, and ctenophora is the bilaterian sister‐group. we suggest that because chaetognaths and lophophorates, taxa traditionally allied with deuterostomes, occupy basal positions within their respective protostomian clades, deuterostomy most likely represents a suite of characters plesiomorphic for bilaterians.
lox-1 and tlr4 affect each other and regulate the generation of ros in a. fumigatus keratitis. the recognition of microbial pathogens by the innate immune system involves toll-like receptors (tlrs), which recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns. different tlrs recognize different pathogen-associated molecular patterns, with tlr-4 mediating the response to lipopolysaccharide from gram-negative bacteria. all tlrs have a toll/il-1 receptor (tir) domain, which is responsible for signal transduction. myd88 is one such protein that contains a tir domain. it acts as an adapter, being involved in tlr-2, tlr-4 and tlr-9 signalling; however, our understanding of how tlr-4 signals is incomplete. here we describe a protein, mal (myd88-adapter-like), which joins myd88 as a cytoplasmic tir-domain-containing protein in the human genome. mal activates nf-κb, jun amino-terminal kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 and -2. mal can form homodimers and can also form heterodimers with myd88. activation of nf-κb by mal requires irak-2, but not irak, whereas myd88 requires both iraks. mal associates with irak-2 by means of its tir domain. a dominant negative form of mal inhibits nf-κb, which is activated by tlr-4 or lipopolysaccharide, but it does not inhibit nf-κb activation by il-1ri or il-18r. mal associates with tlr-4. mal is therefore an adapter in tlr-4 signal transduction.
intercellular signaling pathways in the initiation of mammalian forebrain development in vertebrates, nodal-related genes are crucial for specifying mesendodermal cell fates. six nodal-related genes have been identified in xenopus, but only one, nodal, has been identified in the mouse. the xenopus nodal-related gene 3 (xnr3), however, lacks the mesoderm-inducing activity of the other five nodal-related genes in xenopus, and can directly induce neural tissue in animal caps by antagonizing bmp signals. in this study, we isolated three clones of the xenopus (silurana) tropicalis nodal-related gene 3 (xtnr3) and analyzed their function. the xtnr3 genes show high homology to xnr3 and have the same activity. southern blot and genomic pcr analyses indicate that the x. tropicalis genome has duplications in the xtnr3 gene sequences and our three clones represent separate gene loci. we also found a partial clone of xtnr3 that coded for the n-terminal part of its pro-region. surprisingly, this sequence also induced neural tissue by antagonizing bmp signals, and its coded protein physically associated with bmp4 mature protein. furthermore, we showed that the pro-region of xnr5 has the same activity. together, these findings indicate that the pro-region of nodal-related genes acts antagonistically towards bmp signals, which identifies a novel mechanism for the inhibition of bmp signaling.
single image-based depth estimation using dual off-axis color filtered aperture camera a conventional camera captures blurred versions of scene information away from the plane of focus. camera systems have been proposed that allow for recording all-focus images, or for extracting depth, but to record both simultaneously has required more extensive hardware and reduced spatial resolution. we propose a simple modification to a conventional camera that allows for the simultaneous recovery of both (a) high resolution image information and (b) depth information adequate for semi-automatic extraction of a layered depth representation of the image. our modification is to insert a patterned occluder within the aperture of the camera lens, creating a coded aperture. we introduce a criterion for depth discriminability which we use to design the preferred aperture pattern. using a statistical model of images, we can recover both depth information and an all-focus image from single photographs taken with the modified camera. a layered depth map is then extracted, requiring user-drawn strokes to clarify layer assignments in some cases. the resulting sharp image and layered depth map can be combined for various photographic applications, including automatic scene segmentation, post-exposure refocusing, or re-rendering of the scene from an alternate viewpoint.
male-specific molecular genetic markers in the japanese subterranean termite reticulitermes speratus it is difficult to identify sex in many species of eukaryotic organism. this can considerably impede research into their biology. fortunately, one sex often possesses a unique chromosome termed y or w. when dna markers are available for these chromosomes, then sex identification becomes straightforward. we describe a technique that facilitates the isolation of such markers. the procedure makes use of low-stringency pcr to screen randomly selected primers for their ability to amplify sex-specific loci.
connexin 43 deficiency accelerates skin wound healing and extracellular matrix remodeling in mice. background: expression of connexins and other constituent proteins of gap junctions along with gap junctional intercellular communication are involved in cellular development and differentiation processes. in addition, an increasing number of hereditary skin disorders appear to be linked to connexins. therefore, in this report, the authors studied in vitro gap junctional intercellular communication function and connexin expression in fibroblasts derived from keloid and hypertrophic scar patients. methods: fibroblasts harvested from each of six keloid and hypertrophic scar patients were used for this study. gap junctional intercellular communication function was investigated using the gap fluorescence recovery after photobleaching method, and expression of connexin proteins was studied using quantitative confocal microscopic analyses. results: compared with normal skin, a decreased level of gap junctional intercellular communication was seen in fibroblasts derived from hypertrophic scar tissue, whereas an extremely low gap junctional intercellular communication level was detected in fibroblasts derived from keloid tissue. we also detected little connexin 43 (cx43) protein localized in fibroblasts derived from keloids. moreover, cx43 protein levels were much lower in fibroblasts derived from hypertrophic scars than in those derived from normal skin. conclusions: the authors' data suggest that the loss of gap junctional intercellular communication and connexin expression may affect intercellular recognition and thus break the proliferation and apoptosis balance in fibroblasts derived from keloid and hypertrophic scar tissue.
profiling neuroendocrine gene expression changes following fadrozole-induced estrogen decline in the female goldfish. goldfish (carassius auratus) are excellent model organisms for the neuroendocrine signaling and the regulation of reproduction in vertebrates. goldfish also serve as useful model organisms in numerous other fields. in contrast to mammals, teleost fish do not have a median eminence; the anterior pituitary is innervated by numerous neuronal cell types and thus, pituitary hormone release is directly regulated. here we briefly describe the neuroendocrine control of luteinizing hormone. stimulation by gonadotropin-releasing hormone and a multitude of classical neurotransmitters and neuropeptides is opposed by the potent inhibitory actions of dopamine. the stimulatory actions of gamma-aminobutyric acid and serotonin are also discussed. we will focus on the development of a cdna microarray composed of carp and goldfish sequences which has allowed us to examine neurotransmitter-regulated gene expression in the neuroendocrine brain and to investigate potential genomic interactions between these key neurotransmitter systems. we observed that isotocin (fish homologue of oxytocin) and activins are regulated by multiple neurotransmitters, which is discussed in light of their roles in reproduction in other species. we have also found that many novel and uncharacterized goldfish expressed sequence tags in the brain are also regulated by neurotransmitters. their sites of production and whether they play a role in neuroendocrine signaling and control of reproduction remain to be determined. the transcriptomic tools developed to study reproduction could also be used to advance our understanding of neuroendocrine-immune interactions and the relationship between growth and food intake in fish.
referential choices in a collaborative storytelling task: discourse stages and referential complexity matter in this study, children, young adults and elderly adults were tested in production and comprehension tasks assessing referential choice. our aims were (1) to determine whether speakers egocentrically base their referential choice on the preceding linguistic discourse or also take into account the perspective of a hypothetical listener and (2) whether the possible impact of perspective taking on referential choice changes with increasing age, with its associated changes in cognitive capacity. in the production task, participants described picture-based stories featuring two characters of the same gender, making it necessary to use unambiguous forms; in the comprehension task, participants interpreted potentially ambiguous pronouns at the end of similar orally presented stories. young adults (aged 18–35) were highly sensitive to the informational needs of hypothetical conversational partners in their production and comprehension of referring expressions. in contrast, children (aged 4–7) did not take into account possible conversational partners and tended to use pronouns for all given referents, leading to the production of ambiguous pronouns that are unrecoverable for a listener. this was mirrored in the outcome of the comprehension task, where children were insensitive to the shift of discourse topic marked by the speaker. the elderly adults (aged 69–87) behaved differently from both young adults and children. they showed a clear sensitivity to the other person's perspective in both production and comprehension, but appeared to lack the necessary cognitive capacities to keep track of the prominence of discourse referents, producing more potentially ambiguous pronouns than young adults, though fewer than children. in conclusion then, referential choice seems to depend on perspective taking in language, which develops with increasing linguistic experience and cognitive capacity, but also on the ability to keep track of the prominence of discourse referents, which is gradually lost with older age.
noise limits in thin-film magnetoelectric sensors with magnetic frequency conversion we present an optically pumped magnetometer working in a new operational mode—the light-shift dispersed mz (lsd-mz) mode. it is realized combining various features; (1) high power off-resonant optical pumping; (2) mz configuration, where pumping light and magnetic field of interest are oriented parallel to each other; (3) use of small alkali metal vapor cells of identical properties in integrated array structures, where two such cells are pumped by circularly polarized light of opposite helicity; and (4) subtraction of the mz signals of these two cells. the lsd-mz magnetometer’s performance depends on the inherent and very complex interplay of input parameters. in order to find the configuration of optimal magnetometer resolution, a sensitivity analysis of the input parameters by means of latin hypercube sampling was carried out. the resulting datasets of the multi-dimensional parameter space exploration were assessed by a subsequent physically reasonable interpretation. finally, the best shot-noise limited magnetic field resolution was determined within that parameter space. as the result, using two 50 mm3 integrated vapor cells a magnetic field resolution below 10 ft/√hz at earth’s magnetic field strength is possible.
protective effect of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate against photo-damage induced by ultraviolet a in human skin fibroblasts ultraviolet (uv) exposure induces photodamage of skin. it is a matter of concern that the level of uv radiation reaching the earth surface is increasing as a result of depletion of the stratospheric ozone, and climate change. it is urgently necessary to develop strategies to protect the skin from uv-induced injuries. tea extracts are gaining increasing attention as a supplement in skin care products. however, the factors contributing to the photoprotective effects of tea extracts have not been systematically defined and conflicting results about the effect of tea extracts on photodamage have been reported. in this paper, the literature dealing with the use of tea and its extracts for the prevention of photodamage to the skin as well as the photoprotective effects of tea and its extracts have been highlighted. the potential chemopreventive agents in tea include catechins, caffeine, polysaccharides, apigenin and luteolin which inhibit, reverse or retard the process of the skin photodamage via their sunscreen and antioxidant properties, regulation of signal transduction pathway and gene expression, alleviation of dna damage, and modulation immunological function are also presented. existing gaps in this research field include incomplete clarity of photochemopreventive mechanism of tea, the adverse or side effects of tea extracts owing to residues or impurity and the instability of the functional components of tea during storage.
non-conscious modulation of cardiac defense by masked phobic pictures. if subjects are shown an angry face as a target visual stimulus for less than forty milliseconds and are then immediately shown an expressionless mask, these subjects report seeing the mask but not the target. however, an aversively conditioned masked target can elicit an emotional response from subjects without being consciously perceived,. here we study the mechanism of this unconsciously mediated emotional learning. we measured neural activity in volunteer subjects who were presented with two angry faces, one of which, through previous classical conditioning, was associated with a burst of white noise. in half of the trials, the subjects' awareness of the angry faces was prevented by backward masking with a neutral face. a significant neural response was elicited in the right, but not left, amygdala to masked presentations of the conditioned angry face. unmasked presentations of the same face produced enhanced neural activity in the left, but not right, amygdala. our results indicate that, first, the human amygdala can discriminate between stimuli solely on the basis of their acquired behavioural significance, and second, this response is lateralized according to the subjects' level of awareness of the stimuli.
role of the glycanases exok and exsh in regulating the molecular weight of the rhizobium meliloti exopolysaccharide succinoglycan summarysymbiotic mutants of rhizobium meliloti were isolated following tn5 mutagenesis. besides four nodulation mutants (nod-) unable to induce nodule formation on alfalfa, five infection mutants (inf-), which induce the formation of root nodules without detectable infection threads or bacteroids, were obtained. the inf- mutants were subdivided into two classes. one class contains mutants which fail to synthesize acidic exopolysaccharide (eps-). the other class is comprised of mutants which produce excess amounts of acidic exopolysaccharide (eps*). 13c nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the exopolysaccharide isolated from one of the latter type of inf- mutant, 101.45, revealed that the side chain of the repeating octosaccharide unit lacks the terminal pyruvate residue. complementing cosmids were isolated for all inf- mutants. in the case of the inf- eps- mutants the complementing cosmids contain dna segments which overlap and are part of megaplasmid 2. for two mutants the mutations were found to map on a 7.8 kb ecori fragment. in the case of the inf- eps* mutants the complementing cosmids carry chromosomal dna. the mutations of two inf- eps* mutants were localized on a 6.4 kb ecori fragment. coinoculation of alfalfa plants with nod- and inf- eps- mutants resulted in effective symbiosis. the nodules appeared wild type and fixed nitrogen. in constrast, coinoculations with nod- mutants and the inf- eps* mutant 101.45 did not result in the formation of effective nodules.
effects of ph and calcium ions on the conformational transitions in silk fibroin using 2 d raman correlation spectroscopy and 13 c solid-state nmr the spinning mechanism of natural silk has been an open issue. in this study, both the conformation transition from random coil to beta sheet and the beta sheet aggregation growth of silk fibroin are identified in the b. mori regenerated silk fibroin aqueous solution by circular dichroism (cd) spectroscopy. a nucleation-dependent aggregation mechanism, similar to that found in prion protein, amyloid beta (abeta) protein, and alpha-synuclein protein with the conformation transition from a soluble protein to a neurotoxic, insoluble beta sheet containing aggregate, is a novel suggestion for the silk spinning process. we present evidence that two steps are involved in this mechanism: (a) nucleation, a rate-limiting step involving the conversion of the soluble random coil to insoluble beta sheet and subsequently a series of thermodynamically unfavorable association of beta sheet unit, i.e. the formation of a nucleus or seed; (b) once the nucleus forms, further growth of the beta sheet unit becomes thermodynamically favorable, resulting a rapid extension of beta sheet aggregation. the aggregation growth follows a first order kinetic process with respect to the random coil fibroin concentration. the increase of temperature accelerates the beta sheet aggregation growth if the beta sheet seed is introduced into the random coil fibroin solution. this work enhances our understanding of the natural silk spinning process in vivo.
reversible acute renal failure in a young man with nephrotic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis eighty nephrotic adults with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (fsgs) and plasma creatinine lower than 3 mg/dl were given corticosteroids (53 patients) or immunosuppressive agents (27 patients) for a median of 16 and 75 weeks, respectively. forty-two patients responded with complete remission (29 patients, 36%) or partial remission (13 patients, 16%). twenty-six patients who did not respond were treated again. two patients obtained complete remission and 13 partial remission. the probability of remission was associated with treatment with corticosteroids (p = 0.0001; rr, 3. 93; 95% ci, 2.00 to 7.72), absence of arterial hypertension (p = 0. 0023; rr, 2.59; 95% ci, 1.41 to 4.79), and a percentage of hyaline glomeruli lower than 5% (p = 0.0152; rr, 2.04; 95% ci, 1.15 to 3.64). the probability of being alive at 110 months without doubling of plasma creatinine was 69%. the risk of renal insufficiency was correlated with mesangial proliferation (p = 0.0025; rr, 5.50; 95% ci, 1.82 to 16.60) and with interstitial fibrosis (p = 0.0231; rr, 4. 44; 95% ci, 1.23 to 16.08) at initial biopsy. considering partial or complete remission as a time-dependent variable, only the lack of remission (p = 0.0027; rr, 7.23; 95% ci, 1.98 to 26.33) and mesangial proliferation (p = 0.0069; rr, 4.59; 95% ci, 1.52 to 13. 88) were correlated with renal failure. major side effects were observed in 11 patients (5 infections, 1 peptic ulcer, 2 diabetes, 3 neoplasias). this study shows that 70% of nephrotic adults with fsgs may obtain complete or partial remission and maintain stable renal function for about 10 years when given a prolonged therapy with corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs.
clicking for calamari: toothed whales can echolocate squid loligo pealeii summary toothed whales (odontoceti, cetacea) navigate and locate prey by means of active echolocation. studies on captive animals have accumulated a large body of knowledge concerning the production, reception and processing of sound in odontocete biosonars, but there is little information about the properties and use of biosonar clicks of free-ranging animals in offshore habitats. this study presents the first source parameter estimates of biosonar clicks from two free-ranging oceanic delphinids, the opportunistically foraging pseudorca crassidens and the cephalopod eating grampus griseus. pseudorca produces short duration (30 μs), broadband (q=2–3) signals with peak frequencies around 40 khz, centroid frequencies of 30–70 khz, and source levels between 201–225 db re. 1 μpa (peak to peak, pp). grampus also produces short (40 μs), broadband (q=2–3) signals with peak frequencies around 50 khz, centroid frequencies of 60–90 khz, and source levels between 202 and 222 db re. 1 μpa (pp). on-axis clicks from both species had centroid frequencies in the frequency range of most sensitive hearing, and lower peak frequencies and higher source levels than reported from captive animals. it is demonstrated that sound production in these two free-ranging echolocators is dynamic, and that free-ranging animals may not always employ biosonar signals comparable to the extreme signal properties reported from captive animals in long-range detection tasks. similarities in source parameters suggest that evolutionary factors other than prey type determine the properties of biosonar signals of the two species. modelling shows that interspecific detection ranges of prey types differ from 80 to 300 m for grampus and pseudorca, respectively.
acute enhancement of insulin secretion by ffa in humans is lost with prolonged ffa elevation. in the fasted rat, efficient glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (gsis) is absolutely dependent on an elevated level of circulating free fatty acids (ffas). to determine if this is also true in humans, nonobese volunteers were fasted for 24 h (n = 5) or 48 h (n = 5), after which they received an infusion of either saline or nicotinic acid (na) to deplete their plasma ffa pool, followed by an intravenous bolus of glucose. na treatment resulted in a fall in basal insulin concentrations of 35 and 45% and in the area under the insulin response curve (area under the curve [auc]) to glucose of 47 and 42% in the 24- and 48-h fasted individuals, respectively. the 48-h fasted subjects underwent the same procedure with the addition of a coinfusion of intralipid plus heparin (together with na) to maintain a high concentration of plasma ffas throughout the study. the basal level and auc for insulin were now completely normalized (c-peptide profiles paralleled those for insulin). to assess the effect of an overnight fast, nonobese (n = 6) and obese (n = 6) subjects received an infusion of either saline or na, followed by a hyperglycemic clamp (200 mg/dl). the insulin auc in response to glucose was unaffected by lowering of the ffa level in nonobese subjects, but fell by 29% in the obese group. the data clearly demonstrate that in humans, the rise in circulating ffa levels after 24 and 48 h of food deprivation is critically important for pancreatic beta-cell function both basally and during subsequent glucose loading. they also suggest that the enhancement of gsis by ffas in obese individuals is more prominent than that seen in their nonobese counterparts.
variation in avian vocalizations during the non-breeding season in response to traffic noise this article presents a unifying theory of soundscape ecology, which brings the idea of the soundscape—the collection of sounds that emanate from landscapes—into a research and application focus. our conceptual framework of soundscape ecology is based on the causes and consequences of biological (biophony), geophysical (geophony), and human-produced (anthrophony) sounds. we argue that soundscape ecology shares many parallels with landscape ecology, and it should therefore be considered a branch of this maturing field. we propose a research agenda for soundscape ecology that includes six areas: (1) measurement and analytical challenges, (2) spatial-temporal dynamics, (3) soundscape linkage to environmental covariates, (4) human impacts on the soundscape, (5) soundscape impacts on humans, and (6) soundscape impacts on ecosystems. we present case studies that illustrate different approaches to understanding soundscape dynamics. because soundscapes are our auditory link to nature, we also argue for their protection, using the knowledge of how sounds are produced by the environment and humans.
finite element modeling of short-wavelength folding on venus: implications for the plume hypothesis for crustal plateau formation crustal plateaus on venus constitute one of that planet’s most intriguing tectonic features. they host so-called “tessera” terrain, or deformed crust exhibiting two or more sets of intersecting tectonic lineaments, which comprises»8% of venus’ surface. major questions surrounding crustal plateaus and tessera terrain include: (1) what is the nature of crustal plateau deformation? what structures are present, and what are their spatial and temporal relations? (2) what is the global distribution of tessera terrain? does it form a global layer under the regional plains, cropping out in crustal plateaus, or is it confined to crustal plateaus? and (3) what are the implications of (1) and (2) for understanding the processes responsible for formation and deformation of crustal plateaus? structural and kinematic analyses reveal that deformation at ovda regio, venus largest crustal plateau, is characterized by linear shallow steep-sided troughs (ribbons), long arcuate long-wavelength folds, short mid-wavelength folds, and wide complex graben. temporal relations between structures lead to a three-phase regional strain history consisting of (1) layer-normal flattening of a thin competent membrane resulting in radially oriented, distributed extension (ribbon formation); (2) modest contraction of a thicker layer (concentric folding at plateau margins, interference folding in the plateau interior); and (3) limited extension localized at fold crests (graben formation). wavelength analysis of ribbons and folds places limits on the thickness of the competent layer during each stage of deformation and reflects an early shallow brittle‐ductile transition (bdt) that deepened with time. ovda’s deformation, topography, and gravity are all spatially correlated, strongly suggesting a genetic relationship between surface deformation and processes causing crustal thickening and plateau uplift. thus tessera terrain at ovda regio is likely confined to the topographically high plateau and does not extend beneath the surrounding regional plains. similar patterns persist at other crustal plateaus, indicating that tessera terrain is in general confined to crustal plateaus and does not form a globally continuous layer. ovda’s structures, their spatial and temporal relations, the resulting strain history, and the behavior of the bdt through time support a model of mantle plume upwelling in a thin lithospheric regime for crustal plateau formation and contradict previous downwelling models. similarities between structural and kinematic trends at ovda regio and other crustal plateaus lend support to this idea. c ∞ 1999 academic press
audio–vocal system regulation in children with autism spectrum disorders asperger syndrome (as), belonging to the autism spectrum of disorders, is one of the pervasive developmental disorders. individuals with as usually have normal development of formal speech but pronounced problems in perceiving and producing speech prosody. the present study addressed the discrimination of speech prosody in as by recording the mismatch negativity (mmn) and behavioural responses to natural utterances with different emotional connotations. mmn responses were abnormal in the adults with as in several ways. in these subjects, fewer significantly elicited mmns, diminished mmn amplitudes, as well as prolonged latencies were found. in addition, the mmn generator loci differed between the subjects with as and control subjects. these findings were predominant over the right cerebral hemisphere. these results show impaired neurobiological basis for speech-prosody processing at an early, pre-attentive auditory discrimination stage in as.

early outcome data assessing utility of a post-test genomic counseling framework for the scalable delivery of precision health there has been very limited study of patients with chronic disease receiving potentially actionable genomic based results or the utilization of genetic counselors in the online result delivery process. we conducted a randomized controlled trial on 199 patients with chronic disease each receiving eight personalized and actionable complex disease reports online. primary study aims were to assess the impact of in-person genomic counseling on 1) causal attribution of disease risk, 2) personal awareness of disease risk, and 3) perceived risk of developing a particular disease. of 98 intervention arm participants (mean age = 57.8; 39% female) randomized for in-person genomic counseling, 76 (78%) were seen. in contrast, control arm participants (n = 101; mean age = 58.5; 54% female) were initially not offered genomic counseling as part of the study protocol but were able to access in-person genomic counseling, if they requested it, 3-months post viewing of at least one test report and post-completion of the study-specific follow-up survey. a total of 64 intervention arm and 59 control arm participants completed follow-up survey measures. we found that participants receiving in-person genomic counseling had enhanced objective understanding of the genetic variant risk contribution for multiple complex diseases. genomic counseling was associated with lowered participant causal beliefs in genetic influence across all eight diseases, compared to control participants. our findings also illustrate that for the majority of diseases under study, intervention arm participants believed they knew their genetic risk status better than control arm subjects. disease risk was modified for the majority during genomic counseling, due to the assessment of more comprehensive family history. in conclusion, for patients receiving personalized and actionable genomic results through a web portal, genomic counseling enhanced their objective understanding of the genetic variant risk contribution to multiple common diseases. these results support the development of additional genomic counseling interventions to ensure a high level of patient comprehension and improve patient-centered health outcomes.
a functional vipa-vipb interaction is required for the type vi secretion system activity of vibrio cholerae o1 strain a1552 the bacterium vibrio cholerae, like other human pathogens that reside in environmental reservoirs, survives predation by unicellular eukaryotes. strains of the o1 and o139 serogroups cause cholera, whereas non-o1/non-o139 strains cause human infections through poorly defined mechanisms. using dictyostelium discoideum as a model host, we have identified a virulence mechanism in a non-o1/non-o139 v. cholerae strain that involves extracellular translocation of proteins that lack n-terminal hydrophobic leader sequences. accordingly, we have named these genes “vas” genes for virulence-associated secretion, and we propose that these genes encode a prototypic “type vi” secretion system. we show that vas genes are required for cytotoxicity of v. cholerae cells toward dictyostelium amoebae and mammalian j774 macrophages by a contact-dependent mechanism. a large number of gram-negative bacterial pathogens carry genes homologous to vas genes and potential effector proteins secreted by this pathway (i.e., hemolysin-coregulated protein and vgrg). mutations in vas homologs in other bacterial species have been reported to attenuate virulence in animals and cultured macrophages. thus, the genes encoding the vas-related, type vi secretion system likely play an important conserved function in microbial pathogenesis and represent an additional class of targets for vaccine and antimicrobial drug-based therapies.
autonomous development of natural interactive behavior for robots and embodied agents embodied synchrony of nonverbal behaviour in counselling: a case study of role playing school counselling chika nagaoka (nagaoka@educ.kyoto-u.ac.jp) sakiko yoshikawa (say@educ.kyoto-u.ac.jp) graduate school of education, kyoto university yoshida honmachi, sakyo, kyoto, 606-8501, japan. masashi komori (komori@isc.osakac.ac.jp) faculty of information science and technology, osaka electro-communication university 18-1 hastu-cho, neyagawa-shi, osaka, 572-8530, japan abstract experienced counsellors have mentioned that the client- counsellor relationship, which is of high importance in counselling, may be related to embodied synchrony of nonverbal behaviour, but there is little quantitative research on the topic. the present study captured the embodied synchrony of nonverbal behaviour in counselling from a multiple communication channel perspective, in order to examine the relationship between these channels. at the same time, the relation between embodied synchrony and the mental processes of the client or counsellor, such as the sense of trust between counsellor and client, was investigated. 9-24 participants rated visual and vocal embodied synchrony and sense of trust in role-playing school counselling scenes. the results indicated that embodied synchrony, such as body movement coordination, similarity of voice strength and coordination and smoothness of response timing, have a co- occurrence relation. moreover, significant correlations with evaluated sense of trust suggested that embodied synchrony can act as an indicator reflecting the mental process of a client or counsellor. counselling is a dialogue between a client and a counsellor who is a skilled listener, and is performed with the purpose of overcoming the client’s mental difficulties or obstacles. the counsellor's verbal/nonverbal responses are experientially known to encourage the client's speech, and have the assistance function of guiding the client's thinking from a confused state to a regulated state . conventionally, in the case of investigating and evaluating counselling, the counsellor’s verbal responses are examined as the key element, and only rarely attention is directed towards nonverbal responses. however, we may assume that nonverbal responses are also playing an important role in counselling. it is expected that analyzing the counsellor's nonverbal behaviour would give an important cue also about the characteristics of the response style of listeners in daily conversations. in this study, embodied synchrony is focused upon as a cue to investigating nonverbal behaviour in counselling. embodied synchrony is a phenomenon in which the interactants’ nonverbal behaviour synchronizes and becomes similar; the listener's movements of the head or arms may synchronize with the flow of the speaker's speech, or the way of speaking, postures, mannerisms, and facial expressions may become similar (e.g. cappella, 1981; hess, philippot, & blairy, 1999; feldstein & welkowitz, 1978; cheng & chartrand, 2003). up to the present, embodied synchrony has been described qualitatively by the subjective impressions of skilled counsellors with abundant experience in counselling, and has been considered to indicate the client-counsellor relationship, which is thought to be of primary importance in counselling. there is also some research which indicates quantitatively the congruence of posture in counselling dialogues (e.g. charny, 1966), as well as other studies that indicate the relation between embodied synchrony, such as congruence of posture, duration of pauses or response latencies (i.e., latency before responding to the partner's last utterance), synchrony of body movements, and empathy (maurer & tindall, 1983; staples & sloane, 1976; hall, harrigan, & rosenthal, 1995; bernieri, davis, rosenthal, & knee, 1994). for measuring the degree of embodied synchrony of nonverbal behaviour, a method suggested by bernieri & rosenthal (1991) has been used. this method consists in judges evaluating directly the degree of the overall embodied synchrony in order to quantify it. as opposed to the conventional single-channel approach in which attention is directed towards a particular channel which is examined in detail, this method attempts at capturing nonverbal behaviour on a multi-channel level. however, this method cannot take paralanguage into consideration. to our knowledge, there has been no such method that allowed quantifying vocal synchrony overall. therefore, in this study, an attempt to quantify vocal embodied synchrony overall, adapting bernieri et al. 's method to measure vocal embodied synchrony, in addition to quantifying embodied synchrony of body movement using this method, is carried out. in other words, it is one of this work’s purposes to capture embodied synchrony from a multi-channel perspective. the necessity for investigating embodied synchrony on a multi-channel level was implied by hall et al. (1995). in the present study, it is also examined whether embodied synchrony occurs as a
kicking out the trolls - antecedents of social exclusion intentions in facebook groups we investigated how intentions to hide and unfriend facebook contacts were linked to perceived sender attractiveness and face-threating messages (ftas). intention to hide was higher than intention to unfriend contacts, implying that unfriending is harsher. low social attractiveness predicted hiding and unfriending intentions, but low physical attractiveness was only linked to hiding. disrespectful messages were linked to hiding contacts, while updates that made the receiver look bad were linked to unfriending. ftas also mediated the influence of social and physical attractiveness on hiding and unfriending contacts. overall, managing online relationships relied on independent and interdependent perceptual and behavioral processes.
nivolumab exposure–response analyses of efficacy and safety in previously treated squamous or nonsquamous non–small cell lung cancer background nivolumab was associated with higher rates of objective response than chemotherapy in a phase 3 study involving patients with ipilimumab-refractory metastatic melanoma. the use of nivolumab in previously untreated patients with advanced melanoma has not been tested in a phase 3 controlled study.   methods we randomly assigned 418 previously untreated patients who had metastatic melanoma without a braf mutation to receive nivolumab (at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks and dacarbazine-matched placebo every 3 weeks) or dacarbazine (at a dose of 1000 mg per square meter of body-surface area every 3 weeks and nivolumab-matched placebo every 2 weeks). the primary end point was overall survival.   results at 1 year, the overall rate of survival was 72.9% (95% confidence interval [ci], 65.5 to 78.9) in the nivolumab group, as compared with 42.1% (95% ci, 33.0 to 50.9) in the dacarbazine group (hazard ratio for death, 0.42; 99.79% ci, 0.25 to 0.73; p<0.001). the median progression-free survival was 5.1 months in the nivolumab group versus 2.2 months in the dacarbazine group (hazard ratio for death or progression of disease, 0.43; 95% ci, 0.34 to 0.56; p<0.001). the objective response rate was 40.0% (95% ci, 33.3 to 47.0) in the nivolumab group versus 13.9% (95% ci, 9.5 to 19.4) in the dacarbazine group (odds ratio, 4.06; p<0.001). the survival benefit with nivolumab versus dacarbazine was observed across prespecified subgroups, including subgroups defined by status regarding the programmed death ligand 1 (pd-l1). common adverse events associated with nivolumab included fatigue, pruritus, and nausea. drug-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 11.7% of the patients treated with nivolumab and 17.6% of those treated with dacarbazine.   conclusions nivolumab was associated with significant improvements in overall survival and progression-free survival, as compared with dacarbazine, among previously untreated patients who had metastatic melanoma without a braf mutation.

face recognition using 2.5d shape information previous work has demonstrated that the image variation of many objects (human faces in particular) under variable lighting can be effectively modeled by low-dimensional linear spaces, even when there are multiple light sources and shadowing. basis images spanning this space are usually obtained in one of three ways: a large set of images of the object under different lighting conditions is acquired, and principal component analysis (pca) is used to estimate a subspace. alternatively, synthetic images are rendered from a 3d model (perhaps reconstructed from images) under point sources and, again, pca is used to estimate a subspace. finally, images rendered from a 3d model under diffuse lighting based on spherical harmonics are directly used as basis images. in this paper, we show how to arrange physical lighting so that the acquired images of each object can be directly used as the basis vectors of a low-dimensional linear space and that this subspace is close to those acquired by the other methods. more specifically, there exist configurations of k point light source directions, with k typically ranging from 5 to 9, such that, by taking k images of an object under these single sources, the resulting subspace is an effective representation for recognition under a wide range of lighting conditions. since the subspace is generated directly from real images, potentially complex and/or brittle intermediate steps such as 3d reconstruction can be completely avoided; nor is it necessary to acquire large numbers of training images or to physically construct complex diffuse (harmonic) light fields. we validate the use of subspaces constructed in this fashion within the context of face recognition.
on the portability of trained machine learning classifiers for early application identification the early detection of applications associated with tcp flows is an essential step for network security and traffic engineering. the classic way to identify flows, i.e. looking at port numbers, is not effective anymore. on the other hand, state-of-the-art techniques cannot determine the application before the end of the tcp flow. in this editorial, we propose a technique that relies on the observation of the first five packets of a tcp connection to identify the application. this result opens a range of new possibilities for online traffic classification.
hairpins participating in folding of human telomeric sequence quadruplexes studied by standard and t-remd simulations explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations have been used to complement preceding experimental and computational studies of folding of guanine quadruplexes (g-dna). we initiate early stages of unfolding of several g-dnas by simulating them under no-salt conditions and then try to fold them back using standard excess salt simulations. there is a significant difference between g-dnas with all-anti parallel stranded stems and those with stems containing mixtures of syn and anti guanosines. the most natural rearrangement for all-anti stems is a vertical mutual slippage of the strands. this leads to stems with reduced numbers of tetrads during unfolding and a reduction of strand slippage during refolding. the presence of syn nucleotides prevents mutual strand slippage; therefore, the antiparallel and hybrid quadruplexes initiate unfolding via separation of the individual strands. the simulations confirm the capability of g-dna molecules to adopt numerous stable locally and globally misfolded structures. the key point for a proper individual folding attempt appears to be correct prior distribution of syn and anti nucleotides in all four g-strands. the results suggest that at the level of individual molecules, g-dna folding is an extremely multi-pathway process that is slowed by numerous misfolding arrangements stabilized on highly variable timescales.
observed versus predicted outcome for decompressive craniectomy: a population-based study. objectivedevelop and validate a predictive model of the incidence of long-term disability following traumatic brain injury (tbi) and obtain national estimates for the united states in 2003. data/methodsa logistic regression model was built, using a population-based sample of persons with tbi from the south carolina traumatic brain injury follow-up registry. the regression coefficients were applied to the 2003 healthcare cost and utilization project–nationwide inpatient sample data to estimate the incidence of long-term disability following traumatic brain injury hospitalization. resultsamong 288,009 (95% ci, 287,974–288,043) hospitalized tbi survivors in the united states in 2003, an estimated 124,626 (95% ci, 123,706–125,546) had developed long-term disability. conclusiontbi-related disability is a significant public health problem in the united states. the substantial incidence suggests the need for comprehensive rehabilitative care and services to maximize the potential of persons with tbi.
midbrain dopaminergic neuron fate specification: of mice and embryonic stem cells the homeobox gene otx2 is expressed in the anterior neural tube with a sharp limit at the midbrain/hindbrain junction (the isthmic organizer). otx2 inactivation experiments have shown that this gene is essential for the development of its expression domain. here we investigate whether the caudal limit of otx2 expression is instrumental in positioning the isthmic organizer and in specifying midbrain versus hindbrain fate, by ectopically expressing otx2 in the presumptive anterior hindbrain using a knock-in strategy into the en1 locus. transgenic offspring display a cerebellar ataxia. morphological and histological studies of adult transgenic brains reveal that most of the anterior cerebellar vermis is missing, whereas the inferior colliculus is complementarily enlarged. during early neural pattern formation expression of the midbrain markers wnt1 and ephrin-a5, the isthmic organizer markers pax2 and fgf-8 and the hindbrain marker gbx2 are shifted caudally in the presumptive hindbrain territory. these findings show that the caudal limit of otx2 expression is sufficient for positioning the isthmic organizer and encoding caudal midbrain fate within the mid/hindbrain domain.
developing practice and staff: enabling improvement in care delivery through participatory action research background lecturer practitioner roles are well established in the united kingdom. the national literature demonstrates that these staff are valuable to national health service trusts and universities however, their roles are busy and demanding, with conflicting expectations from the two employers. in addition, their role in addressing the theory-practice gap - a major reason for their establishment - is at best unclear. although a number of qualitative studies have explored the topic, there have been no systematic attempts to develop the role or to quantify the effects on postholders.   aim this paper reports a study that aimed to develop aspects of lecturer practitioners' work roles, examine the effects of this on individuals at one english university, and to quantify lecturer practitioners' occupational stress and burnout.   methods a flexible, 'spiral' action research framework and 'collaborative group approach' were used, with mixed methods of data collection. data were collected through focus groups, meetings and participant feedback, and participants' reflective diaries. a questionnaire using previously validated psychological attitude rating scales was also used to measure occupational stress and burnout, the extent to which the project influenced these, and the influence of lecturer practitioners' experience and qualifications. six null hypotheses were constructed to measure these ideas. findings from qualitative and quantitative perspectives were triangulated to give depth to the analysis.   findings five themes emerged from the focus groups: personal motivation, workload pressures, role clarity, preparation and support, and gains from the role. specific policies and documentation were developed as a result of this initial project planning work. the findings from the questionnaire indicated that lecturer practitioners were no more stressed or burnt out than comparable workers. synthesis of findings indicated, broadly speaking, that these lps were 'thriving rather than just surviving'.   conclusion action research was an effective methodology for uncovering new knowledge, and bringing about organizational change in this project.
oscillator-based assistance of cyclical movements: model-based and model-free approaches a quasi-passive leg exoskeleton is presented for load-carrying augmentation during walking. the exoskeleton has no actuators, only ankle and hip springs and a knee variabledamper. without a payload, the exoskeleton weighs 11.7 kg and requires only 2 watts of electrical power during loaded walking. for a 36 kg payload, we demonstrate that the quasi-passive exoskeleton transfers on average 80% of the load to the ground during the single support phase of walking. by measuring the rate of oxygen consumption on a study participant walking at a self-selected speed, we find that the exoskeleton slightly increases the walking metabolic cost of transport (cot) as compared to a standard loaded backpack (10% increase). however, a similar exoskeleton without joint springs or damping control (zero-impedance exoskeleton) is found to increase cot by 23% compared to the loaded backpack, highlighting the benefits of passive and quasi-passive joint mechanisms in the design of efficient, low-mass leg exoskeletons.
determinants of preference for lesser-known species among cabinet-makers in oyo and osun states, nigeria olivia has extensive forests. many of these forests have been mined for three species of timber: mahogany (swietenia macrophylla), spanish cedar (cedrela odorata), and south american oak (amburana cearensis). extraction of these timber species has helped the bolivian economy generate foreign exchange and cope with past economic crises. however, the sector is now faced with a new challenge: the forests of boliviaareunable tosupply international markets with traditional species due to previous high levels of extraction. the forestry sector needs to utilize more of the “other” timber species. if products utilizing these species are not developed, bolivia’s forestland will likely be converted to other uses, and the potential for bolivia to remain a major tropical wood producer will be lost.
brain metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma: a case report and literature review cancer registrations among young individuals (under age 30 years) for a 30‐year period (1960–1989) were used to investigate the risk of cancer in migrants to israel, and in their offspring, relative to israel‐born individuals with israel‐born parents. relative risks of testis and ovarian cancer (germ cell tumours and carcinomas), melanoma, and carcinomas of nasopharynx, colorectum, breast, cervix and thyroid were calculated according to father's birthplace, and odds ratios for birthplace of mother, or of both parents. the estimates were adjusted for the effects of age, sex and time period. for 3 cancers, i.e., testis cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and melanoma, there were quite large differences in incidence, which persisted to some degree into the second generation, suggesting that inherited susceptibility may underlie some of the variation. for ovarian, colorectal, cervical and thyroid cancers, differences in risk between the migrant groups had largely disappeared in their offspring, suggesting that environmental exposures, which were modified by migration, are the major causative factors. int. j. cancer 70:654–660, 1997. © 1997 wiley‐liss, inc.
simple and reliable method to quantify the hepatitis b viral load and replicative capacity in liver tissue and blood leukocytes it remains unclear whether hepatitis b virus (hbv) replicates in extrahepatic tissues, and particularly in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs), which may serve as a reservoir for the maintenance of infection. a real-time pcr assay for the quantitation of total and covalently closed circular (ccc) hbv dna in serum and in pbmcs was developed. this assay was highly sensitive (detection limit: 27 iu/ml), linear over a wide range (9 log10), and was displayed high inter- and intra-assay reproducibility for the quantitation of total dna. genotypes a to e were detected and the results were consistent with those obtained with the cobas amplicor hbv monitor test. the specificity of the methodology was increased by prior treatment with an enzyme that digests relaxed circular dna, and the elimination of background signals from virus adsorbed to the surface of pbmcs. hbv dna was detected in the serum and pbmcs of 12 hbsag-positive patients, with less than 1% in the cccdna form. in conclusion, the quantitation of total and ccc hbv dna in pbmcs is potentially useful as a non-invasive marker, and may help to increase our knowledge of the natural history of hepatitis b.
recovering missing labels of crowdsourcing workers we consider the general problem of learning from labeled and unlabeled data, which is often called semi-supervised learning or transductive inference. a principled approach to semi-supervised learning is to design a classifying function which is sufficiently smooth with respect to the intrinsic structure collectively revealed by known labeled and unlabeled points. we present a simple algorithm to obtain such a smooth solution. our method yields encouraging experimental results on a number of classification problems and demonstrates effective use of unlabeled data.
piggyback-the-winner in host-associated microbial communities marine viruses affect bacteria, archaea and eukaryotic organisms and are major components of the marine food web. most studies have focused on their role as predators and parasites, but many of the interactions between marine viruses and their hosts are much more complicated. a series of recent studies has shown that viruses have the ability to manipulate the life histories and evolution of their hosts in remarkable ways, challenging our understanding of this almost invisible world.
greatly elevated urea excretion after air exposure appears to be carrier mediated in the slender lungfish (protopterus dolloi) the possible presence of a urea transporter in the kidney of the gulf toadfish (opsanus beta) and further characterization of the pulsatile facilitated transporter previously identified in its gills were investigated by comparing the extra-renal and renal handling of two urea analogues with the handling of urea. toadfish were fitted with caudal artery and indwelling urinary ureteral catheters and injected with an iso-osmotic dose of (14)c-labelled urea analogue (acetamide or thiourea) calculated to bring plasma analogue concentrations close to plasma urea concentrations. branchial permeabilities to urea, acetamide and thiourea were similar during non-pulsing periods and all increased during pulse events, although urea permeability was greater than analogue permeability during pulses. the incidence and magnitude of acetamide and urea pulses at the gills were significantly correlated, acetamide pulses being 35-50 % of the size of urea pulses. however, the thiourea and urea pulses at the gills were only weakly correlated, thiourea pulses being less than 16 % of the size of urea pulses. thiourea inhibited branchial urea excretion by reducing the pulse frequency. the renal handling of thiourea and urea were similar in that both substances were more concentrated in the urine than in the plasma, whereas acetamide was found in equal concentrations in the urine and plasma. urea and thiourea were secreted 2-3 times more effectively than cl(-) and water, whereas acetamide was secreted at a similar relative rate. the differential handling of the urea analogues by the gills and kidney indicates the presence of a different, possibly unique, transporter in the kidney. the movement of thiourea and urea into the renal tubule against an apparent concentration gradient suggests the presence of an active transport mechanism.
influence of biofuel crops on mosquito production and oviposition site selection biofuels are a new priority in efforts to reduce dependence on fossil fuels; nevertheless, the rapid increase in production of biofuel feedstock may threaten biodiversity. there are general principles that should be used in developing guidelines for certifying biodiversity-friendly biofuels. first, biofuel feedstocks should be grown with environmentally safe and biodiversity-friendly agricultural practices. the sustainability of any biofuel feedstock depends on good growing practices and sound environmental practices throughout the fuel-production life cycle. second, the ecological footprint of a biofuel, in terms of the land area needed to grow sufficient quantities of the feedstock, should be minimized. the best alternatives appear to be fuels of the future, especially fuels derived from microalgae. third, biofuels that can sequester carbon or that have a negative or zero carbon balance when viewed over the entire production life cycle should be given high priority. corn-based ethanol is the worst among the alternatives that are available at present, although this is the biofuel that is most advanced for commercial production in the united states. we urge aggressive pursuit of alternatives to corn as a biofuel feedstock. conservation biologists can significantly broaden and deepen efforts to develop sustainable fuels by playing active roles in pursuing research on biodiversity-friendly biofuel production practices and by helping define biodiversity-friendly biofuel certification standards.

sex determination in madagascar geckos of the genus paroedura (squamata: gekkonidae): are differentiated sex chromosomes indeed so evolutionary stable? recently, amphibians and reptiles have drawn attention because of declines in species and populations caused mainly by habitat loss, overexploitation and climate change. this study constructed a dna barcode database for the korean herpetofauna, including all the recorded amphibians and 68% of the recorded reptiles, to provide a useful, standardized tool for species identification in monitoring and management. a total of 103 individuals from 18 amphibian and 17 reptile species were used to generate barcode sequences using partial sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit i (coi) gene and to compare it with other suggested barcode loci. comparing 16s rrna, cytochrome b (cytb) and coi for amphibians and 12s rrna, cytb and coi for reptiles, our results revealed that coi is better than the other markers in terms of a high level of sequence variation without length variation and moderate amplification success. although the coi marker had no clear barcoding gap because of the high level of intraspecific variation, all of the analysed individuals from the same species clustered together in a neighbour‐joining tree. high intraspecific variation suggests the possibility of cryptic species. finally, using this database, confiscated snakes were identified as elaphe schrenckii, designated as endangered in korea and a food contaminant was identified as the lizard takydromus amurensis.
pp2a/b56 and gsk3/ras suppress pkb activity during dictyostelium chemotaxis protein kinases akt and pkbr1 of dictyostelium belong to the agc protein kinase superfamily. akt and pkbr1 are phosphorylated at similar sites by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (pdk1) and torc2 kinases; however, they have different subcellular localizing domains. akt has a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (pi3k)/phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate [ptdins(3,4,5)p3]-regulated ph (pleckstrin homology) domain whereas pkbr1 is myristoylated and persistently membrane localized. using strains defective for pi3k/ptdins(3,4,5)p3-, pdk1- and torc2-signaling or strains that express phospho-site mutants of akt and pkbr1, we dissect the different roles of pi3k/ptdins(3,4,5)p3, pdk1 and torc2. we show that activation of akt and pkbr1 requires pdk1-site phosphorylation, but that phosphorylation by torc2 is insufficient for akt or pkbr1 activation. however, pdk1-site phosphorylation is dependent on phosphorylation by torc2, which suggests that there is regulatory coordination among pdk1, torc2 and their phospho-site targets. this defines a separate input for signaling in control of chemotaxis and dependency on pdk1 function. we also demonstrate that pdk1 in dictyostelium functions independently of pi3k/ptdins(3,4,5)p3. finally, we show that akt and pkbr1 exhibit substrate selectivity and identify two novel lipid-interacting proteins preferentially phosphorylated by akt. despite certain similarities, akt and pkbr1 have distinct regulatory paths that impact activation and effector targeting, with pdk1 serving a central role.
assessment of lamination stack production this paper presents investigations into the eddy current losses of laminated stator cores with electrically connected edge areas. the application of various manufacturing processes can lead to an electrical connection of the lamination core edges and therefore to additional eddy current losses. this paper considers the impact of connected core edges on the losses of a ring core sample. the analysis shows that the eddy current losses increase dramatically when connecting the core edges. based on the results achieved by finite element analysis, a simple equivalent electric circuit model is introduced. for verification of the model, the circuit model is introduced. for verification of the model, the circuit was simulated with an analog circuit simulation software. finally the calculated results have been validated experimentally on a ring core sample with galvanically connected edges.
endothelial cell-derived interleukin-6 regulates tumor growth although cervical carcinoma incidence and mortality rates have declined in the u.s. greatly since the introduction of the papanicolaou smear, this decline has not been uniform for all histologic subtypes. therefore, the authors assessed the differential incidence rates of squamous cell carcinoma (scc) and adenocarcinoma (ac) of the cervix by race and disease stage for the past 25 years.
the her2-mir125a5p/mir125b loop in gastric and esophageal carcinogenesis. background trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2; also known as erbb2), was investigated in combination with chemotherapy for first-line treatment of her2-positive advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer.   methods toga (trastuzumab for gastric cancer) was an open-label, international, phase 3, randomised controlled trial undertaken in 122 centres in 24 countries. patients with gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer were eligible for inclusion if their tumours showed overexpression of her2 protein by immunohistochemistry or gene amplification by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation. participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive a chemotherapy regimen consisting of capecitabine plus cisplatin or fluorouracil plus cisplatin given every 3 weeks for six cycles or chemotherapy in combination with intravenous trastuzumab. allocation was by block randomisation stratified by eastern cooperative oncology group performance status, chemotherapy regimen, extent of disease, primary cancer site, and measurability of disease, implemented with a central interactive voice recognition system. the primary endpoint was overall survival in all randomised patients who received study medication at least once. this trial is registered with clinicaltrials.gov, number nct01041404.   findings 594 patients were randomly assigned to study treatment (trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, n=298; chemotherapy alone, n=296), of whom 584 were included in the primary analysis (n=294; n=290). median follow-up was 18.6 months (iqr 11-25) in the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy group and 17.1 months (9-25) in the chemotherapy alone group. median overall survival was 13.8 months (95% ci 12-16) in those assigned to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy compared with 11.1 months (10-13) in those assigned to chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio 0.74; 95% ci 0.60-0.91; p=0.0046). the most common adverse events in both groups were nausea (trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, 197 [67%] vs chemotherapy alone, 184 [63%]), vomiting (147 [50%] vs 134 [46%]), and neutropenia (157 [53%] vs 165 [57%]). rates of overall grade 3 or 4 adverse events (201 [68%] vs 198 [68%]) and cardiac adverse events (17 [6%] vs 18 [6%]) did not differ between groups.   interpretation trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy can be considered as a new standard option for patients with her2-positive advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer.   funding f hoffmann-la roche.
women-specific hiv/aids services: identifying and defining the components of holistic service delivery for women living with hiv/aids specialized substance abuse treatment programs have been developed for women within the past two decades. this article presents the results of a secondary analysis of a regional database of drug abuse treatment programs that compared the characteristics of women-only (wo) and mixed-gender (mg) programs across three treatment modalities. in general, wo programs differed from mg programs in their policies regarding fees, sources of payment, special populations served, services offered, and treatment capacity, process, and duration. the differences in program characteristics reflect broader societal gender differences, including women's generally lower economic status and primary responsibility for child-rearing.
ion channel clustering enhances weak electric field detection by neutrophils: apparent roles of skf96365-sensitive cation channels and myeloperoxidase trafficking in cellular responses application of extremely low frequency pulsed dc electric fields that are frequency- and phase-matched with endogenous metabolic oscillations leads to greatly exaggerated neutrophil extension and metabolic resonance wherein oscillatory nad(p)h amplitudes are increased. in the presence of a resonant field, migrating cell length grows from 10 to approximately 40 microm, as does the overall length of microfilament assemblies. in contrast, cells stop locomotion and become spherical when exposed to phase-mismatched fields. although cellular effects were not found to be dependent on electrode type and buffer, they were sensitive to temporal constraints (phase and pulse length) and cell surface charge. we suggest an electromechanical coupling hypothesis wherein applied electric fields and cytoskeletal polymerization forces act together to overcome the surface/cortical tension of neutrophils, thus promoting net cytoskeletal assembly and heightened metabolic amplitudes. metabolic resonance enhances reactive oxygen metabolic production by neutrophils. furthermore, cellular dna damage was observed after prolonged metabolic resonance using both single cell gel electrophoresis ('comet' assay) and 3'-oh dna labeling using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. these results provide insights into transmembrane signal processing and cell interactions with weak electric fields.
phishing detection based associative classification data mining building fast and accurate classifiers for large-scale databases is an important task in data mining. there is growing evidence that integrating classification and association rule mining together can produce more efficient and accurate classifiers than traditional classification techniques. in this paper, the problem of producing rules with multiple labels is investigated. we propose a new associative classification approach called multi-class, multi-label associative classification (mmac). this paper also presents three measures for evaluating the accuracy of data mining classification approaches to a wide range of traditional and multi-label classification problems. results for 28 different datasets show that the mmac approach is an accurate and effective classification technique, highly competitive and scalable in comparison with other classification approaches.
behavioral responses in mice selectively bred for high and low levels of open-field thigmotaxis an overview of ethologically-based animal models suitable for investigating the pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders is presented. the dsm-iiir classification provides a framework for the discussion. the limitations of the models in current use are considered. it is suggested that there is a need for a greater emphasis on animal models of anxiety with an etiological basis.
model-based reinforcement learning with continuous states and actions in general, it is difficult to determine an optimal closed-loop policy in nonlinear control problems with continuous-valued state and control domains. hence, approximations are often inevitable. the standard method of discretizing states and controls suffers from the curse of dimensionality and strongly depends on the chosen temporal sampling rate. in this paper, we introduce gaussian process dynamic programming (gpdp) and determine an approximate globally optimal closed-loop policy. in gpdp, value functions in the bellman recursion of the dynamic programming algorithm are modeled using gaussian processes. gpdp returns an optimal state- feedback for a finite set of states. based on these outcomes, we learn a possibly discontinuous closed-loop policy on the entire state space by switching between two independently trained gaussian processes. a binary classifier selects one gaussian process to predict the optimal control signal. we show that gpdp is able to yield an almost optimal solution to an lq problem using few sample points. moreover, we successfully apply gpdp to the underpowered pendulum swing up, a complex nonlinear control problem.
cyberknife radiosurgery for the treatment of intraocular and periocular lymphoma. immunodysregulation appears to play a prominent role in the evolution of some lymphomas, as evidenced by the strong associations between congenital and acquired immunodeficiencies and lymphoid neoplasia, and abnormal ratios of helper t cells in lymphoid proliferations. lympho-proliferative diseases of the ocular adnexa encompass a spectrum of lesions that may present with similar clinical and radiological features. most primary lymphoid proliferations of the ocular adnexa consist of small lymphocytes of b-cell origin. employing morphological, immunohistochemical, and molecular genetic criteria, proliferations may be separated into polyclonal and monoclonal categories. increased insight into the biology and behavior of these tumors tells us that seemingly benign, as well as frankly malignant proliferations, might disseminate to nodal or extranodal sites. the diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disease of any type necessitates a complete workup for systemic lymphoma. major prognostic criteria for lymphomas are anatomical site, stage, and histological features. radiotherapy is employed for localized lymphoid proliferations, with chemotherapy recommended for disseminated disease. long-term follow-up with semiannual examination is recommended. a significant percentage of primary ocular adnexal lymphoid lesions are malt-type lymphomas, extranodal low-grade b-cell lymphomas usually associated with mucosal tissues or glandular epithelia. the pathogenesis of this lymphoma in orbital soft tissue, which normally is devoid of lymphoid tissue, lymphatic vessels, and epithelium, is unclear. malt-type lymphomas of the ocular adnexa follow an indolent course, with long periods between relapses, and are responsive to therapy. dissemination, when it occurs, preferentially affects other extranodal sites.
mace: a new interface for comparing and editing of multiple alternative documents for generative design visualizing network data, from tree structures to arbitrarily connected graphs, is a difficult problem in information visualization. a large part of the problem is that in network data, users not only have to visualize the attributes specific to each data item, but also the links specifying how those items are connected to each other. past approaches to resolving these difficulties focus on zooming, clustering, filtering and applying various methods of laying out nodes and edges. such approaches, however, focus only on optimizing a network visualization in a single view, limiting the amount of information that can be shown and explored in parallel. moreover, past approaches do not allow users to cross reference different subsets or aspects of large, complex networks. in this paper, we propose an approach to these limitations using multiple coordinated views of a given network. to illustrate our approach, we implement a tool called dualnet and evaluate the tool with a case study using an email communication network. we show how using multiple coordinated views improves navigation and provides insight into large networks with multiple node and link properties and types.

an fpga implementation architecture for decoding of polar codes the two central topics of information theory are the compression and the transmission of data. shannon, in his seminal work, formalized both these problems and determined their fundamental limits. since then the main goal of coding theory has been to find practical schemes that approach these limits. polar codes, recently invented by arikan, are the first "practical" codes that are known to achieve the capacity for a large class of channels. their code construction is based on a phenomenon called "channel polarization". the encoding as well as the decoding operation of polar codes can be implemented with o(n log n) complexity, where n is the blocklength of the code. we show that polar codes are suitable not only for channel coding but also achieve optimal performance for several other important problems in information theory. the first problem we consider is lossy source compression. we construct polar codes that asymptotically approach shannon's rate-distortion bound for a large class of sources. we achieve this performance by designing polar codes according to the "test channel", which naturally appears in shannon's formulation of the rate-distortion function. the encoding operation combines the successive cancellation algorithm of arikan with a crucial new ingredient called "randomized rounding". as for channel coding, both the encoding as well as the decoding operation can be implemented with o(n log n) complexity. this is the first known "practical" scheme that approaches the optimal rate-distortion trade-off. we also construct polar codes that achieve the optimal performance for the wyner-ziv and the gelfand-pinsker problems. both these problems can be tackled using "nested" codes and polar codes are naturally suited for this purpose. we further show that polar codes achieve the capacity of asymmetric channels, multi-terminal scenarios like multiple access channels, and degraded broadcast channels. for each of these problems, our constructions are the first known "practical" schemes that approach the optimal performance. the original polar codes of arikan achieve a block error probability decaying exponentially in the square root of the block length. for source coding, the gap between the achieved distortion and the limiting distortion also vanishes exponentially in the square root of the blocklength. we explore other polar-like code constructions with better rates of decay. with this generalization, we show that close to exponential decays can be obtained for both channel and source coding. the new constructions mimic the recursive construction of arikan and, hence, they inherit the same encoding and decoding complexity. we also propose algorithms based on message-passing to improve the finite length performance of polar codes. in the final two chapters of this thesis we address two important problems in graphical models related to communications. the first problem is in the area of low-density parity-check codes (ldpc). for practical lengths, ldpc codes using message-passing decoding are still the codes to beat. the current analysis, using density evolution, evaluates the performance of these algorithms on a tree. the tree assumption corresponds to using an infinite length code. but in practice, the codes are of finite length. we analyze the message-passing algorithms for this scenario. the absence of tree assumption introduces correlations between various messages. we show that despite this correlation, the prediction of the tree analysis is accurate. the second problem we consider is related to code division multiple access (cdma) communication using random spreading. the current analysis mainly focuses on the information theoretic limits, i.e., using gaussian input distribution. however in practice we use modulation schemes like binary phase-shift keying (bpsk), which is far from being gaussian. the effects of the modulation scheme cannot be analyzed using traditional tools which are based on spectrum of large random matrices. we follow a new approach using tools developed for random spin systems in statistical mechanics. we prove a tight upper bound on the capacity of the system when the user input is bpsk. we also show that the capacity depends only on the power of the spreading sequences and is independent of their exact distribution.
exogenous proline and glycine betaine in plants under stress tolerance natural osmoregulatory substances (osmolytes) allow a wide variety of organisms to adjust to environments with high salt and/or low water content. in addition to their role in osmoregulation, some osmolytes protect proteins from denaturation and deactivation by, for example, elevated temperature and chaotropic compounds. a ubiquitous protein-stabilizing osmolyte is glycine betaine (n-trimethyl glycine). its presence has been reported in bacteria, in particular cyanobacteria, in animals and in plants from higher plants to algae. in the present review we describe the experimental evidence related to the ability of glycine betaine to enhance and stabilize the oxygen-evolving activity of the photosystem ii protein complexes of higher plants and cyanobacteria. the osmolyte protects the photosystem ii complex against dissociation of the regulatory extrinsic proteins (the 18 kd, 23 kd and 33 kd proteins of higher plants and the 9 kd protein of cyanobacteria) from the intrinsic components of the photosystem ii complex, and it also stabilizes the coordination of the mn cluster to the protein cleft. by contrast, glycine betaine has no stabilizing effect on partial photosynthetic processes that do not involve the oxygen-evolving site of the photosystem ii complex. it is suggested that glycine betaine might act, in part, as a solute that is excluded from charged surface domains of proteins and also as a contact solute at hydrophobic surface domains.
doping of tio2–go and tio2–rgo with noble metals: synthesis, characterization and photocatalytic performance for azo dye discoloration we report on the synthesis of phase-pure tio(2) nanoparticles in anatase, rutile and brookite structures, using amorphous titania as a common starting material. phase formation was achieved by hydrothermal treatment at elevated temperatures with the appropriate reactants. anatase nanoparticles were obtained using acetic acid, while phase-pure rutile and brookite nanoparticles were obtained with hydrochloric acid at a different concentration. the nanomaterials were characterized using x-ray diffraction, uv-visible reflectance spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy. we propose that anatase formation is dominated by surface energy effects, and that rutile and brookite formation follows a dissolution-precipitation mechanism, where chains of sixfold-coordinated titanium complexes arrange into different crystal structures depending on the reactant chemistry. the particle growth kinetics under hydrothermal conditions are determined by coarsening and aggregation-recrystallization processes, allowing control over the average nanoparticle size.
the six metal binding domains in human copper transporter, atp7b: molecular biophysics and disease-causing mutations backgroundwilson﻿'s disease ﻿with﻿ osseomuscular type is a rare condition, which often lacks typical hepatic and neurological symptoms and causes misdiagnoses easily. during the past 10 years, eight chinese patients of osseomuscular type of wilson's disease were identified in our clinic.methodsclinical information was gathered from medical records and follow-ups. the genetic testing was performed in each patient. serum ceruloplasmin, kayser-fleischer rings, liver function, brain magnetic resonance imaging and abdominal ultrasonography were also evaluated.resultsthe median age of onset is 12 years of age. the patients had their initial musculoskeletal conditions with arthralgia or joint deformity, while the hepatic or neurologic signs were minimal. most patients (6/8) eventually developed clinical neurological symptoms afterwards with a median interval of 36 months. all of them had normal liver function and low serum ceruloplasmin (<0.1 g/l). most patients (6/8) present with kayser-fleischer rings and abnormal hepatic ultrasonography. the arthralgia was resolved with copper chelation therapy.conclusionswilson’s disease with osseomuscular type occurs without typical hepatic or neurological symptoms, which makes the clinical diagnosis challenging. serum ceruloplasmin, abdominal ultrasonography, ophthalmic examination and genetic testing help to establish the diagnosis. early diagnosis can initiate an effective treatment and prevent the further damage.
hmga proteins promote atm expression and enhance cancer cell resistance to genotoxic agents the high mobility group hmga1 protein belongs to a family of architectural factors that play a role in chromosomal organisation and gene transcription regulation. hmga1 overexpression represents a common feature of human malignant tumours and is causally associated with neoplastic transformation and metastatic progression. recently, hmga1 expression has been correlated with the presence of chromosomal rearrangements and suggested to promote genomic instability. here, we report a novel interaction between hmga1 protein and the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (atm) kinase, the major key player in the cellular response to dna damage caused by several agents such as ionising radiation (ir). we identified an sq motif on hmga1, which is effectively phosphorylated by atm in vitro and in vivo. interestingly, confocal microscopy revealed that hmga1 colocalises with the activated form of atm (atm s1981p). moreover, hmga1 ectopic expression decreases cell survival following exposure to ir as assessed by clonogenic survival in mcf-7 cells, further supporting the hypothesis that hmga1 might act as a downstream target of the atm pathway in response to dna damage.
treatment of adolescent overweight and obesity we investigated the influence of nutrition and exercise interventions within cognitive/behavioral and public health formats on weight and blood lipid profiles in obese children. compliance was also examined as well as the relationship of the compliance measures with clinical outcome variables. three conditions were compared over 16 sessions: nutrition and eating-habit change followed by exercise (ne), exercise followed by nutrition and eating-habit change (en), and an information control (info). ne and en were presented in a cognitive/ behavioral framework which focused on the development of self-regulation whereas the info condition received the same material in a public health/educational model. ne and en participants evidenced modest, yet significant, reductions in weight and blood lipids, and the impact of these two interventions endured at a five-year follow-up. in contrast, info participants displayed stable weight and blood lipids during the course of the program, and most remained morbidly obese at follow-up. improved nutrition, increased physical activity and fitness were significantly correlated with weight and lipid reductions.
working overtime: patterns of smartphone and pc usage in the day of an information worker the number of computing devices that people use is growing. to gain a better understanding of why and how people use multiple devices, we interviewed 27 people from academia and industry. from these interviews we distill four primary findings. first, associating a user's activities with a particular device is problematic for multiple device users because many activities span multiple devices. second, device use varies by user and circumstance; users assign different roles to devices both by choice and by constraint. third, users in industry want to separate work and personal activities across work and personal devices, but they have difficulty doing so in practice finally, users employ a variety of techniques for accessing information across devices, but there is room for improvement: participants reported managing information across their devices as the most challenging aspect of using multiple devices. we suggest opportunities to improve the user experience by focusing on the user rather than the applications and devices; making devices aware of their roles; and providing lighter-weight methods for transferring information, including synchronization services that engender more trust from users.
annual and diurnal variations of gaseous and particulate pollutants in 31 provincial capital cities based on in situ air quality monitoring data from china national environmental monitoring center. o3 and pm2.5 were introduced into the newly revised air quality standard system in february 2012, representing a milestone in the history of air pollution control, and china's urban air quality will be evaluated using six factors (so2, no2, o3, co, pm2.5 and pm10) from the beginning of 2013. to achieve the new air quality standard, it is extremely important to have a primary understanding of the current pollution status in various cities. the spatial and temporal variations of the air pollutants were investigated in 26 pilot cities in china from august 2011 to february 2012, just before the new standard was executed. hourly averaged so2, no2 and pm10 were observed in 26 cities, and the pollutants o3, co and pm2.5 were measured in 15 of the 26 cities. the concentrations of so2 and co were much higher in the cities in north china than those in the south. as for o3 and no2, however, there was no significant difference between northern and southern cities. fine particles were found to account for a large proportion of airborne particles, with the ratio of pm2.5 to pm10 ranging from 55% to 77%. the concentrations of pm2.5 (57.5 microg/m3) and pm10 (91.2 microg/m3) were much higher than the values (pm2.5: 11.2 microg/m3; pm10: 35.6 microg/m3) recommended by the world health organization. the attainment of the new urban air quality standard in the investigated cities is decreased by 20% in comparison with the older standard without considering o3, co and pm2.5, suggesting a great challenge in urban air quality improvement, and more efforts will to be taken to control air pollution in china.

finite element modeling of short-wavelength folding on venus: implications for the plume hypothesis for crustal plateau formation crustal plateaus on venus constitute one of that planet’s most intriguing tectonic features. they host so-called “tessera” terrain, or deformed crust exhibiting two or more sets of intersecting tectonic lineaments, which comprises»8% of venus’ surface. major questions surrounding crustal plateaus and tessera terrain include: (1) what is the nature of crustal plateau deformation? what structures are present, and what are their spatial and temporal relations? (2) what is the global distribution of tessera terrain? does it form a global layer under the regional plains, cropping out in crustal plateaus, or is it confined to crustal plateaus? and (3) what are the implications of (1) and (2) for understanding the processes responsible for formation and deformation of crustal plateaus? structural and kinematic analyses reveal that deformation at ovda regio, venus largest crustal plateau, is characterized by linear shallow steep-sided troughs (ribbons), long arcuate long-wavelength folds, short mid-wavelength folds, and wide complex graben. temporal relations between structures lead to a three-phase regional strain history consisting of (1) layer-normal flattening of a thin competent membrane resulting in radially oriented, distributed extension (ribbon formation); (2) modest contraction of a thicker layer (concentric folding at plateau margins, interference folding in the plateau interior); and (3) limited extension localized at fold crests (graben formation). wavelength analysis of ribbons and folds places limits on the thickness of the competent layer during each stage of deformation and reflects an early shallow brittle‐ductile transition (bdt) that deepened with time. ovda’s deformation, topography, and gravity are all spatially correlated, strongly suggesting a genetic relationship between surface deformation and processes causing crustal thickening and plateau uplift. thus tessera terrain at ovda regio is likely confined to the topographically high plateau and does not extend beneath the surrounding regional plains. similar patterns persist at other crustal plateaus, indicating that tessera terrain is in general confined to crustal plateaus and does not form a globally continuous layer. ovda’s structures, their spatial and temporal relations, the resulting strain history, and the behavior of the bdt through time support a model of mantle plume upwelling in a thin lithospheric regime for crustal plateau formation and contradict previous downwelling models. similarities between structural and kinematic trends at ovda regio and other crustal plateaus lend support to this idea. c ∞ 1999 academic press
a small multifunctional pentatricopeptide repeat protein in the chloroplast of chlamydomonas reinhardtii. using the repeat finding algorithm ft-rep, we have identified 154 pentatricopeptide repeat (ppr) proteins in nine fully sequenced genomes from green algae (with a total of 1201 repeats) and grouped them in 47 orthologous groups. all data are available in a database, pprdb, accessible online at http://giavap-genomes.ibpc.fr/ppr. based on phylogenetic trees generated from the repeats, we propose evolutionary scenarios for ppr proteins. two pprs are clearly conserved in the entire green lineage: mrl1 is a stabilization factor for the rbcl mrna, while hcf152 binds in plants to the psbh-petb intergenic region. mca1 (the stabilization factor for peta) and ppr7 (a short ppr also acting on chloroplast mrnas) are conserved across the entire chlorophyta. the other pprs are clade-specific, with evidence for gene losses, duplications, and horizontal transfer. in some ppr proteins, an additional domain found at the c terminus provides clues as to possible functions. ppr19 and ppr26 possess a methyltransferase_4 domain suggesting involvement in rna guanosine methylation. ppr18 contains a c-terminal cbs domain, similar to the cbsppr1 protein found in nucleoids. ppr16, ppr29, ppr37, and ppr38 harbor a smr (muts-related) domain similar to that found in land plants ptac2, gun1, and svr7. the ppr-cyclins ppr3, ppr4, and ppr6, in addition, contain a cyclin domain c-terminal to their smr domain. ppr31 is an unusual ppr-cyclin containing at its n terminus an octotricopeptide repeat (opr) and a rap domain. we consider the possibility that ppr proteins with a smr domain can introduce single-stranded nicks in the plastid chromosome.

mechanical traction for mechanical neck disorders: a systematic review. a randomised clinical trial was conducted in the department of physical medicine, chittagong medical college hospital from july, 2001 to june, 2002. the objectives of the study were to find out the effects of cervical traction (ct) and exercise on the patients with chronic cervical spondylosis. a total of 199 patients with cervical spondylosis were included in the clinical trial. one hundred patients were treated with cervical traction plus exercise and 99 patients were treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid). posture correction advice was given to all patients. the patients were treated for 6 weeks. there was a marked improvement in both the groups after treatment (p<0.001). but there was nearly significant difference regarding improvement in treatment with ct plus exercise than with nsaid (p = 0.06). the results indicate that the improvement of the patients with chronic cervical spondylosis was more in ct plus exercise than analgesics. so, ct & neck muscle strengthening exercise may have some more beneficial effects than nsaids on chronic cervical spondylosis.
intermediate hosts of angiostrongylus cantonensis in tenerife, spain background angiostrongylus cantonensis is a lungworm of rats (muridae) that is the causative agent of human cerebral angiostrongyliasis. the life cycle of a. cantonensis involves rats and mollusks as the definitive and intermediate hosts, respectively. this study was designed to increase the knowledge about the occurrence and distribution of a. cantonensis in its definitive host in the canary islands, using parasitological and serological analysis in different areas and age groups. methodology/principal findings between 2009 and 2010, 54 black rats (rattus rattus) from tenerife were captured from six human-inhabited areas and sera samples were obtained. the lung nematodes were identified by morphological and molecular tools as a. cantonensis. the 31-kda glycoprotein antigen was purified from a. cantonensis adult worms by electrophoresis and electroelution. of the 54 tested rodents, 30 showed igg antibodies against a. cantonensis 31-kda antigen by elisa. therefore, the overall seroprevalence was 55.6% (95% ci: 42.4–68). seroprevalent rodents were found in all the 6 areas. this 31-kda antigen was not recognized by some sera of rats infected by other helminth species (but not a. cantonensis). seroprevalence of igg antibodies against a. cantonensis and prevalence based on the presence of adult worms showed significant correlation (r2 = 0.954, p<0.05). conclusions/significance the present results could indicate a high prevalence of a. cantonensis in tenerife and suggest the inclusion of two new zones in the distribution area of the parasite. the commonness and wide distribution of a. cantonensis in rats implies the presence of intermediate hosts, indicating that humans may be at risk of getting infected.
actigraph accelerometer-defined boundaries for sedentary behaviour and physical activity intensities in 7 year old children objective this study was designed to validate accelerometer-based activity monitors against energy expenditure (ee) in children; to compare monitor placement sites; to field-test the monitors; and to establish sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous threshold counts.   research methods and procedures computer science and applications actigraph (csa) and mini-mitter actiwatch (mm) monitors, on the hip or lower leg, were validated and calibrated against 6-hour ee measurements by room respiration calorimetry, activity by microwave detector, and heart rate by telemetry in 26 children, 6 to 16 years old. during the 6 hours, the children performed structured activities, including resting metabolic rate (rmr), nintendo, arts and crafts, aerobic warm-up, tae bo, treadmill walking and running, and games. activity energy expenditure (aee) computed as ee - rmr was regressed against counts to derive threshold counts.   results the mean correlations between ee or aee and counts were slightly higher for mm-hip (r = 0.78 +/- 0.06) and mm-leg (r = 0.80 +/- 0.05) than csa-hip (r = 0.66 +/- 0.08) and csa-leg (r = 0.73 +/- 0.07). csa and mm performed similarly on the hip (inter-instrument r = 0.88) and on the lower leg (inter-instrument r = 0.89). threshold counts for the csa-hip were <800, <3200, <8200, and > or = 8200 for sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous categories, respectively. for the mm-hip, the threshold counts were <100, <900, <2200, and > or = 2200, respectively.   discussion the validation of the csa and mm monitors against aee and their calibration for sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous thresholds certify these monitors as valid, useful devices for the assessment of physical activity in children.
iranian health research networks and vision of iran by 2025: a case of virtual health network in emri abstracthealth research systems can link knowledge generation with practical concerns to improve health and health equity. interest in health research, and in how health research systems should best be organised, is moving up the agenda of bodies such as the world health organisation. pioneering health research systems, for example those in canada and the uk, show that progress is possible. however, radical steps are required to achieve this. such steps should be based on evidence not anecdotes. health research policy and systems (harps) provides a vehicle for the publication of research, and informed opinion, on a range of topics related to the organisation of health research systems and the enormous benefits that can be achieved. following the mexico ministerial summit on health research, who has been identifying ways in which it could itself improve the use of research evidence. the results from this activity are soon to be published as a series of articles in harps.this editorial provides an account of some of these recent key developments in health research systems but places them in the context of a distinguished tradition of debate about the role of science in society. it also identifies some of the main issues on which 'research on health research' has already been conducted and published, in some cases in harps. finding and retaining adequate financial and human resources to conduct health research is a major problem, especially in low and middle income countries where the need is often greatest. research ethics and agenda-setting that responds to the demands of the public are issues of growing concern. innovative and collaborative ways are being found to organise the conduct and utilisation of research so as to inform policy, and improve health and health equity. this is crucial, not least to achieve the health-related millennium development goals. but much more progress is needed. the editorial ends by listing a wide range of topics related to the above priorities on which we hope to feature further articles in harps and thus contribute to an informed debate on how best to achieve such progress.
a secure rfid authentication protocol for healthcare environments using elliptic curve cryptosystem p b f the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organization’s (jcaho) universal protocal, part of their national patient safety goal to prevent wrong site, wrong procedure, and wrong person surgery, became effective on july 1, 2004. this guideline applies to all operative and other invasive procedures, including those done in settings other than the operating room such as endoscopy, imaging, emergency services, special procedures, etc. standard pc.13.20 ep 9 of the jcaho standards requires that “the site, procedure, and patient are accurately identified and clearly communicated using active communication techniques, during a final verification process such as a time-out before the start of any surgical or invasive procedure.” in response to this patient safety initiative, new technology has been developed.
species-specific responses to community density in an unproductive perennial plant community the trophic dynamics of the yukon boreal forest have been under investigation at the kluane lake research station since 1973. we monitored and conducted experiments on the major species in this ecosystem, except the large mammals (for logistic reasons). the central problem has been to determine the causes of the 9 – 10 year cycle of snowshoe hares, and to achieve this we carried out several large-scale experiments manipulating food supplies, predator pressure, and soil nutrient availability to test hypotheses that food, predation, or habitat quality regulate populations. the hare cycle is driven top-down by predators, and most hares die because they are killed by predators. predators also cause stress in female hares, and the stress response seems to be responsible for the loss of reproductive potential in the decline and low phases of the hare cycle. many of the specialist predators and some herbivores in this ecosystem fluctuate with the hare cycle. arctic ground squirrels do, but red squirrels do not, being linked closely to white spruce seed masting years. small rodents fluctuate in numbers in two patterns. red-backed voles and four species of microtus voles have a 3 – 4 year cycle that seems to be driven by food supplies and social behaviour. deer mice, in contrast, have fluctuated dramatically in the 38 years we have monitored them, but not cyclically. white spruce seed production varies with temperature and rainfall, but was not affected by adding nutrients in fertilizer. global warming and reduced hare browsing in the last 20 years have helped to increase the abundance of shrubs in these forests. it will be challenging to predict how this system will change as climatic warming proceeds, because even closely related species in the same trophic level respond differently to perturbations. we recommend continued monitoring of the major species in these boreal forests.
cardiovascular and neuroendocrine effects and pharmacokinetics of 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine in humans. despite a paucity of data on its animal pharmacology and toxicology, mdma [ecstasy, xtc, adam; (+/-)-3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine] was introduced as an "underground" (fda-unapproved) adjunct to psychotherapy in the late 1970's and early 1980's, in addition to its use as a recreational drug. analysis of the limited experimental literature indicates that ld50's for mdma in five species by several routes of administration tend to predict a significant human toxicity. mdma was either equally toxic or slightly to moderately less toxic than its close congener, mda, (+/-)-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine. it is suggested that extrapolation of the pharmacologic/toxicologic data available for mda to mdma should be assumed to be valid until disproven. recently published canine data describe physiologic disturbances caused by acute overdosage of mda, and also indicate the utility of chlorpromazine as an antidote preventing fatalities associated with severe hyperthermia, lactacidemia, hypertension and tachycardia. the toxicology of mdma warrants further direct study in view of its continuing illegal distribution.
recombinant dimeric mhc antigens protect cardiac allografts from rejection and visualize alloreactive t cells three human class i major histocompatibility antigens (hla) with molecular masses of 44, 39, and 36 kda were identified in plasma by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. further biochemical characterization showed that these antigens in plasma could be fractionated by sephacryl s-300 column chromatography into two different pools. the 44-kda intact hla heavy chains are detected only in pool i and have an apparent molecular weight of 200,000 as determined by calibrated gel filtration column chromatography. the 39- and 36-kda hla heavy chains are present only in pool ii and have an apparent molecular weight of 50,000. hla in pool i can be extracted by triton x-114 detergent, but 39- and 36-kda plasma hla in pool ii are water soluble and not extractable by triton x-114. amino acid sequences of nh2 termini for 44- and 39-kda plasma hla are identical to that of cellular hla. in contrast, the nh2-terminal amino acid sequence for 36-kda plasma hla has not been reported previously for any other proteins. since the loss of both transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail at the carboxyl terminus of hla will generate a 36-kda protein, the findings suggest that the 39-kda hla might be the product of alternatively spliced mrna with deletion of the exon coding for transmembrane domain. by using polymerase chain reaction and dna sequencing, the presence of alternatively spliced mrna with deletion of the transmembrane domain exon was identified in mononuclear leukocytes of peripheral blood. this alternatively spliced hla mrna was not detectable in mononuclear leukocytes of an individual who had no 39-kda plasma hla. this finding indicates that the alternatively spliced mrna in mononuclear leukocytes is responsible for the synthesis of a secretable class i hla.
significance of the 13c-caffeine breath test for patients with cirrhosis the properties of caffeine render it an ideal substrate for a quantitative test of liver function. the aim of this study was to determine whether the caffeine breath test (cbt) using orally administered 13c‐caffeine correlates reliably with plasma caffeine clearance and reflects varying degrees of liver dysfunction. the cbt was performed in 25 healthy controls; 20 subjects with noncirrhotic, chronic hepatitis b or c; and 20 subjects with cirrhosis. plasma caffeine clearance was assayed simultaneously with the cbt in a cohort of these subjects. over a broad range of caffeine clearances, the cbt exhibited a highly significant correlation with plasma clearance (r = 0.85, p < .001). cirrhotic patients were characterized by significantly reduced cbt values (1.15 ± 0.75 δ‰ mg−1) compared with controls (2.23 ± 0.76; p = .001) and hepatitic patients (1.83 ± 1.05; p = .04). there was a significant inverse relationship between the cbt and child‐pugh score (r = −.74, p = .002). the intraclass correlation coefficient between repeated cbts in 20 subjects with normal and cirrhotic livers was 0.89. although smoking was associated with an 86% to 141% increase in cbt in all groups, the cbt was able to distinguish control, hepatitic, and cirrhotic smokers (5.36 ± 0.82, 3.63 ± 1.21, and 2.14 ± 1.14, respectively, p = .001). multivariate analysis revealed that only smoking (p < .001) and disease state (p = .001) were significant predictors of the cbt. in conclusion, the 13c‐cbt represents a valid indicator of plasma caffeine clearance and correlates reproducibly with hepatic dysfunction.
optimal survival time-related cut-point with censored data. in biomedical research and practice, quantitative tests or biomarkers are often used for diagnostic or screening purposes, with a cut point established on the quantitative measurement to aid binary classification. this paper introduces an alternative to the traditional methods based on the youden index and the closest-to-(0, 1) criterion for threshold selection. a concordance probability evaluating the classification accuracy of a dichotomized measure is defined as an objective function of the possible cut point. a nonparametric approach is used to search for the optimal cut point maximizing the objective function. the procedure is shown to perform well in a simulation study. using data from a real-world study of arsenic-induced skin lesions, we apply the method to a measure of blood arsenic levels, selecting a cut point to be used as a warning threshold.
a population-based analysis of behavior problems in children with cerebral palsy. a half-hour diagnostic psychiatric interview was described for use with 7- to 12-year-old children. four studies of reliability and validity were reported. inter-rater reliability was examined by having children interviewed by one psychiatrist while a second psychiatrist observed without taking part. at the end of the interview, without any discussion, both psychiatrists independently made separate ratings of the child's psychiatric state. re-test reliability was examined by having a further series of children interviewed twice, once by each author, with an interval of 1 to 30 days between the interviews. validity was tested by comparing the interview findings for a randomly selected sample of the general population and a sample of children judged to have psychiatric disorder on the basis of information from teachers and parents. the interviewing psychiatrist knew only the child's name and age and was unaware of the selection group from which the child was drawn.  a short psychiatric interview with a child was found to be a reasonably sensitive diagnostic instrument which could give rise to reliable and valid judgments on whether the child exhibited any psychiatric disorder. however, on the whole, individual ratings on specific aspects of behaviour proved to be less reliable than the overall psychiatric diagnosis. there were also marked differences in the reliability and usefulness of the various specific ratings.  depression proved to be a more difficult item than anxiety to rate reliably, but both were found to be reasonably efficient in the differentiation of the child with psychiatric disorder. the child's attention or persistence on cognitive tasks was also rated fairly reliably, and proved to be a surprisingly good indicator of psychiatric disorder. the child's emotional responsiveness at interview and the relationship he formed with the psychiatrist could be rated reliably, and these items also effectively differentiated children with psychiatric disorder from "control" children in the general population.  some of the inferences involved in the diagnostic process were examined in relation to the assessment of anxiety. it was shown, for example, that whereas fidgetiness is commonly taken to be an indicator of anxiety this assumption is frequently misleading. tension and tremulousness were also less useful indicators of anxiety than tearfulness, an anxious expression and preoccupation with anxiety topics at interview.  the main uses and limitations of the interview have been briefly discussed. it is concluded that the interview with the child (aged 7 to 12 years) forms a useful part of the diagnostic procedure in child psychiatry.
stepwise activity of clpy (hslu) mutants in the processive degradation of escherichia coli clpyq (hsluv) protease substrates. in the prokaryotic homolog of the eukaryotic proteasome, hsluv, the "double donut" hslv protease is allosterically activated by hslu, an aaa protein of the clp/hsp100 family consisting of three (amino-terminal, carboxy-terminal, and intermediate) domains. the intermediate domains of hslu, which extend like tentacles from the hexameric ring formed by the amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal domains, have been deleted; an asymmetric hslu(deltai)(6)hslv(12) complex has been crystallized; and the structure has been solved to 2.5a resolution, revealing an assembly in which a hslu(deltai) hexamer binds one end of the hslv dodecamer. the conformation of the protomers of the hslu(deltai)-complexed hslv hexamer is similar to that in the symmetric wild-type hsluv complex, while the protomer conformation of the uncomplexed hslv hexamer is similar to that of hslv alone. reaction in the crystals with a vinyl sulfone inhibitor reveals that the hslu(deltai)-complexed hslv hexamer is active, while the uncomplexed hslv hexamer is inactive. these results confirm that hslv can be activated by binding of a hexameric hslu(deltai)(6) ring lacking the i domains, that activation is effected through a conformational change in hslv rather than through alteration of the size of the entry channel into the protease catalytic cavity, and that the two hslv(6) rings in the protease dodecamer are activated independently rather than cooperatively.
behavioural and neuroplastic effects of the new-generation antidepressant agomelatine compared to fluoxetine in glucocorticoid receptor-impaired mice. i. introduction past studies of antidepressants have focused almost exclusively on their effects on the metabolism and receptors of monoamine neurotransmitters in various brain regions. these studies have been extended to the molecular effects of antidepressants and have led to a profoundly expanded understanding of their actions in the central nervous system. for example, long-term administration of antidepressants decreases the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, down-regulates camp-dependent protein kinase, modulates the mrna expression of central β-adrenoceptors and serotonin (5-ht) receptors, and alters the functional activity of specific g protein subunits and adenylyl cyclase (1). taken together, these and many other recent observations clearly indicate that antidepressants interfere not only with the production and release of catecholamines and indolamines but also with the signal transduction of those neurotransmitters that have long been implicated in the pathogenesis and treatment of depression...
expression of cyp 11 b 2 in aldosterone-producing adrenocortical adenoma : regulatory mechanisms and clinical significance primary aldosteronism is the most prevalent form of secondary hypertension. to explore molecular mechanisms of autonomous aldosterone secretion, we performed exome sequencing of aldosterone-producing adenomas (apas). we identified somatic hotspot mutations in the atp1a1 (encoding an na+/k+ atpase α subunit) and atp2b3 (encoding a ca2+ atpase) genes in three and two of the nine apas, respectively. these atpases are expressed in adrenal cells and control sodium, potassium and calcium ion homeostasis. functional in vitro studies of atp1a1 mutants showed loss of pump activity and strongly reduced affinity for potassium. electrophysiological ex vivo studies on primary adrenal adenoma cells provided further evidence for inappropriate depolarization of cells with atpase alterations. in a collection of 308 apas, we found 16 (5.2%) somatic mutations in atp1a1 and 5 (1.6%) in atp2b3. mutation-positive cases showed male dominance, increased plasma aldosterone concentrations and lower potassium concentrations compared with mutation-negative cases. in summary, dominant somatic alterations in two members of the atpase gene family result in autonomous aldosterone secretion.
connexin 43 deficiency accelerates skin wound healing and extracellular matrix remodeling in mice. background: expression of connexins and other constituent proteins of gap junctions along with gap junctional intercellular communication are involved in cellular development and differentiation processes. in addition, an increasing number of hereditary skin disorders appear to be linked to connexins. therefore, in this report, the authors studied in vitro gap junctional intercellular communication function and connexin expression in fibroblasts derived from keloid and hypertrophic scar patients. methods: fibroblasts harvested from each of six keloid and hypertrophic scar patients were used for this study. gap junctional intercellular communication function was investigated using the gap fluorescence recovery after photobleaching method, and expression of connexin proteins was studied using quantitative confocal microscopic analyses. results: compared with normal skin, a decreased level of gap junctional intercellular communication was seen in fibroblasts derived from hypertrophic scar tissue, whereas an extremely low gap junctional intercellular communication level was detected in fibroblasts derived from keloid tissue. we also detected little connexin 43 (cx43) protein localized in fibroblasts derived from keloids. moreover, cx43 protein levels were much lower in fibroblasts derived from hypertrophic scars than in those derived from normal skin. conclusions: the authors' data suggest that the loss of gap junctional intercellular communication and connexin expression may affect intercellular recognition and thus break the proliferation and apoptosis balance in fibroblasts derived from keloid and hypertrophic scar tissue.
cytogenetic analysis of giant oocytes and zygotes to assess their relevance for the development of digynic triploidy. the data using a maximum‐likelihood method was that 66.4 yo of the triploids were the result of dispermy, 23.6 % the result of fertilization of a haploid ovum by a diploid sperm formed by failure of the first meiotic division in the male and 10 % the result of a diploid egg formed by failure of the first maternal meiotic division. the possible sources of error inherent in the technique me reviewed and our results compared with previously published data.
an approach of top-k keyword querying for fuzzy xml keyword search enables web users to easily access xml data without the need to learn a structured query language and to study possibly complex data schemas. existing work has addressed the problem of selecting qualified data nodes that match keywords and connecting them in a meaningful way, in the spirit of inferring a where clause in xquery. however, how to infer the return clause for keyword search is an open problem.  to address this challenge, we present an xml keyword search engine, xseek, to infer the semantics of the search and identify return nodes effectively. xseek recognizes possible entities and attributes inherently represented in the data. it also distinguishes between search predicates and return specifications in the keywords. then based on the analysis of both xml data structures and keyword match patterns, xseek generates return nodes. extensive experimental studies show the effectiveness of xseek.
improving software fault injection we describe how legacy c++ programs can be rejuvenated using c++11 features such as generalized constant expressions, perfect forwarding, and lambda expressions. in general, this work develops a correspondence between different kinds of macros and the c++ declarations to which they should be transformed. we have created a set of demacrofication tools to assist a developer in the rejuvenation of c++ programs. to evaluate the work, we have applied the rejuvenation tools to a number of c++ libraries to assess the extent to which these libraries might be improved by demacrofication. results indicate that between 68 and 98% of potentially refactorable macros could be transformed into c++11 declarations. additional experiments demonstrate why these numbers are not readily achieved using fully automated rejuvenation tools. we also discuss some techniques to further assist in automating rejuvenation process.
determinants of preference for lesser-known species among cabinet-makers in oyo and osun states, nigeria olivia has extensive forests. many of these forests have been mined for three species of timber: mahogany (swietenia macrophylla), spanish cedar (cedrela odorata), and south american oak (amburana cearensis). extraction of these timber species has helped the bolivian economy generate foreign exchange and cope with past economic crises. however, the sector is now faced with a new challenge: the forests of boliviaareunable tosupply international markets with traditional species due to previous high levels of extraction. the forestry sector needs to utilize more of the “other” timber species. if products utilizing these species are not developed, bolivia’s forestland will likely be converted to other uses, and the potential for bolivia to remain a major tropical wood producer will be lost.
dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids enhance hormone ablation therapy in androgen-dependent prostate cancer. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) are antitumorigenic in humans as well as in animal models of intestinal neoplasia, such as the adenomatous polyposis coli min/ (apc ) mouse. nsaids inhibit cyclooxygenase (cox) isozymes, which are responsible for the committed step in prostaglandin biosynthesis, and this has been considered the primary mechanism by which nsaids exert their antitumorigenic effects. however, mounting evidence suggests the existence of cox-independent mechanisms. in the present study, we attempted to clarify this issue by treating apc mice bearing established tumors with nsaids (piroxicam and sulindac, 0.5 and 0.6 mg/mouse/day, respectively) for 6 days and concomitantly bypassing cox inhibition by treatment with the e prostaglandin (ep) receptor agonists 16,16-dimethyl-prostaglandin e2 (pge2) and 17-phenyl-trinor-pge2 (10 g each, three times daily) administered via gavage and/or i.p. routes. treatment with piroxicam and sulindac resulted in 95% and 52% fewer tumors, respectively, and a higher ratio of apoptosis:mitosis in tumors from sulindac-treated mice as compared with controls. these effects were attenuated by concomitant ep receptor agonist treatment, suggesting pge2 is important in the maintenance of tumor integrity. immunological sequestration of pge2 with an anti-pge2 monoclonal antibody likewise resulted in 33% fewer tumors in apc mice relative to untreated controls, additionally substantiating a role for pge2 in tumorigenesis. the ep receptor subtype ep1 mediates the effects of pge2 by increasing intracellular calcium levels ([ca 2 ]i), whereas antagonism of ep1 has been shown to attenuate tumorigenesis in apc mice. we demonstrate that [ca ]i is significantly elevated in tumors of apc min/ mice relative to the adjacent normal-appearing mucosa. furthermore, treatment with piroxicam results in significantly lower [ca ]i in tumors, and this effect is attenuated by concomitant treatment with the ep1/ep3 receptor agonist 17-phenyl-trinor-pge2. overall, our results suggest that nsaids exert their antitumorigenic effects, in part, via interference with pge2 biosynthesis, and these effects may be mediated through changes in intracellular calcium levels.
the escherichia coli phosphotyrosine proteome relates to core pathways and virulence stringent starvation protein a (sspa) of escherichia coli is an rna polymerase-associated transcriptional activator for the lytic development of phage p1 and is essential for stationary phase-induced acid tolerance of e. coli. we report the crystal structure of yersinia pestis sspa, which is 83% identical to e. coli sspa in amino acid sequence and is functionally complementary in supporting the lytic growth of phage p1 and acid resistance of an e. coli sspa mutant. the structure reveals that sspa assumes the characteristic fold of glutathione s-transferase (gst). however, sspa lacks gst activity and does not bind glutathione. three regions of sspa are flexible, the n and c termini and the α2-helix. the structure also reveals a conserved surface-exposed pocket composed of residues from a loop between helices α3 and α4. the functional roles of these structural features were investigated by assessing the ability of deletion and site-directed mutants to confer acid resistance of e. coli and to activate transcription from a phage p1 late promoter, thereby supporting the lytic growth of phage p1. the results indicate that the flexible regions are not critical for sspa function, whereas the surface pocket is important for both transcriptional activation of the phage p1 late promoter and acid resistance of e. coli. the size, shape, and property of the pocket suggest that it mediates protein-protein interactions. sspa orthologs from y. pestis, vibrio cholerae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa are all functional in acid resistance of e. coli, whereas only y. pestis sspa supports phage p1 growth.
the inability of bacillus licheniformis perr mutant to grow is mainly due to the lack of perr-mediated fur repression perr is a ferric uptake repressor (fur) homolog that functions as the central regulator of the inducible peroxide stress response in bacillus subtilis. perr has been previously demonstrated to regulate the mrga, kata, ahpcf, hemaxcdbl, and zosa genes. we now demonstrate that perr also mediates both the repression of its own gene and that of fur. whereas perr-mediated repression of most target genes can be elicited by either manganese or iron, repression of perr and fur is selective for manganese. genetic studies indicate that repression of perr regulon genes by either manganese or iron requires perr and is generally independent of fur. indeed, in a fur mutant, iron-mediated repression is enhanced. unexpectedly, repression of the fur gene by manganese appears to require both perr and fur, but only perr binds to the fur regulatory region in vitro. the fur mutation appears to act indirectly by affecting cellular metal ion pools and thereby affecting perr-mediated repression. while many components of the perr regulon are strongly induced by hydrogen peroxide, little, if any, induction of fur and perr could be demonstrated. thus, not all components of the perr regulon are components of the peroxide stimulon. we suggest that perr exists in distinct metallated forms that differ in dna target selectivity and in sensitivity to oxidation. this model is supported by the observation that the metal ion composition of the growth medium can greatly influence the transcriptional response of the various perr regulon genes to hydrogen peroxide.
long-term visual acuity results of treated and untreated radiation retinopathy it is suspected that radiation retinopathy is more likely to develop in an eye with preexisting diabetic retinopathy than in a normal eye. however, there is only one report of this occurring, at a radiation dose of 4500 rads. we present a woman with minimal diabetic retinopathy who had breast carcinoma which was treated with chemotherapy but metastasised to the choroid. within nine months of external beam radiation (3000 rads in fractions of 200 rads) a fulminant retinopathy evolved in that eye, while the non-radiated eye showed no change. the histopathology of radiation and diabetic retinopathy and causes for possible synergism are discussed. as this case report shows, radiation oncologists and ophthalmologists need to be aware of the risk that patients with minimal diabetic retinopathy who have undergone chemotherapy may suffer a dramatic visual loss from radiation therapy despite a radiation dose which is considered adequate, safe, and properly fractionated.
rna polymerase elongation factors. the universal bacterial transcription elongation factor nusa mediates elongation activities of rna polymerase. by itself, nusa induces transcription pausing and facilitates intrinsic termination, but nusa also is a cofactor of antiterminators that antagonize pausing and prevent termination. we show that nusa is required for lambda-related phage 82 antiterminator q(82) to construct a stable complex in which rna-based termination mechanisms have restricted access to the emerging transcript; this result suggests a locale for both q(82) and nusa near the beta flap domain of rna polymerase. furthermore, as nusa is not required for the antipausing activity of q(82) in vitro, we distinguish two distinct activities of antiterminators, namely antipausing and rna occlusion, and discuss their roles in q(82) function.
shiga toxin and beta-lactamases genes in escherichia coli phylotypes isolated from carcasses of broiler chickens slaughtered in iran. the relationship between human diseases caused by infection with shiga toxin (stx)-producing escherichia coli (stec) o157 strains and o157 strains isolated from cattle was investigated in an area where stockbreeding is prolific. for this purpose, the stx genotypes, the molecular epidemiological characteristics of 268 stec o157 strains including 211 human-origin strains and 57 cattle-origin strains, and clinical manifestations of 210 stec-infected people were analyzed. of 211 human-origin strains, 92 strains (44%) were of the stx1/stx2 genotype, and 74 strains (35%) were of the stx2c genotype. most of the people infected with stx2c genotype strains presented no symptoms or mild symptoms such as slight diarrhea, except for 3 patients with bloody diarrhea. of the 57 cattle-origin strains, 27 strains (47%) were of the stx2c genotype and 17 strains (30%) were of the stx1/stx2 genotype. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and insertion sequence (is) analysis demonstrated that 11 isolates (41%) of the 27 cattle isolates of the stx2c genotype had high homology (>95% identity) with human isolates. these results suggest that some genetic patterns of the stx2c genotype strains might be preserved in cattle or their surrounding environment for several years, and during these periods, they might have opportunities to infect people through various routes. because of the mild virulence of the stx2c genotype strains, they seemed to be transmitted asymptomatically from cattle to humans and then spread from person to person. it may be a public health concern. further, they occasionally cause severe symptoms in humans; therefore, caution is warranted for infections by stx2c genotype o157 strains, in addition to stx2-possessing genotype o157 strains.
factors affecting unmet need for family planning in southern nations, nationalities and peoples region, ethiopia the southern nations, nationalities, and people's region of ethiopia (snnpr) is home to 11 million people constituting more than 45 language and ethnic groups, most of whom live in extremely poor rural communities. data for currently married, fecund women aged 15-49 from demographic surveys conducted in the snnpr in 1990 and 1997 are used to investigate contraceptive knowledge and communication, and the use and future need for family planning services in this population. this study focuses on how these processes are affected by household organization and women's status, and on their implications for population policies and programs. considerations of the implications of these results for understanding the fertility transition of a highly diverse african population under severe stress are presented. although household extension and polygamy characterize one-third of the women sampled, they do not affect the women's contraceptive behavior. women's literacy and autonomy are, by far, the most significant forces in the movement toward lower fertility in the region.
a prospective randomized trial using blood volume analysis in addition to pulmonary artery catheter, compared with pulmonary artery catheter alone, to guide shock resuscitation in critically ill surgical patients background recent studies have suggested that early goal-directed resuscitation of patients with septic shock and conservative fluid management of patients with acute lung injury (ali) can improve outcomes. because these may be seen as potentially conflicting practices, we set out to determine the influence of fluid management on the outcomes of patients with septic shock complicated by ali.   methods a retrospective analysis was performed at barnes-jewish hospital (st. louis, mo) and in the medical icu of mayo medical center (rochester, mn). patients hospitalized with septic shock were enrolled into the study if they met the american-european consensus definition of ali within 72 h of septic shock onset. adequate initial fluid resuscitation (aifr) was defined as the administration of an initial fluid bolus of >or= 20 ml/kg prior to and achievement of a central venous pressure of >or= 8 mm hg within 6 h after the onset of therapy with vasopressors. conservative late fluid management (clfm) was defined as even-to-negative fluid balance measured on at least 2 consecutive days during the first 7 days after septic shock onset.   results the study cohort was made up of 212 patients with ali complicating septic shock. hospital mortality was statistically lowest for those achieving both aifr and clfm and higher for those achieving only clfm, those achieving only aifr, and those achieving neither (17 of 93 patients [18.3%] vs 13 of 31 patients [41.9%] vs 30 of 53 patients [56.6%] vs 27 of 35 [77.1%], respectively; p < 0.001).   conclusions both early and late fluid management of septic shock complicated by ali can influence patient outcomes.
the dna repair enzyme apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (apex nuclease) 2 has the potential to protect against down-regulation of chondrocyte activity in osteoarthritis oxidative stress leads to increased risk for osteoarthritis (oa) but the precise mechanism remains unclear. we undertook this study to clarify the impact of oxidative stress on the progression of oa from the viewpoint of oxygen free radical induced genomic instability, including telomere instability and resulting replicative senescence and dysfunction in human chondrocytes. human chondrocytes and articular cartilage explants were isolated from knee joints of patients undergoing arthroplastic knee surgery for oa. oxidative damage and antioxidative capacity in oa cartilage were investigated in donor-matched pairs of intact and degenerated regions of tissue isolated from the same cartilage explants. the results were histologically confirmed by immunohistochemistry for nitrotyrosine, which is considered to be a maker of oxidative damage. under treatment with reactive oxygen species (ros; 0.1 μmol/l h2o2) or an antioxidative agent (ascorbic acid: 100.0 μmol/l), cellular replicative potential, telomere instability and production of glycosaminoglycan (gag) were assessed in cultured chondrocytes. in tissue cultures of articular cartilage explants, the presence of oxidative damage, chondrocyte telomere length and loss of gag to the medium were analyzed in the presence or absence of ros or ascorbic acid. lower antioxidative capacity and stronger staining of nitrotyrosine were observed in the degenerating regions of oa cartilages as compared with the intact regions from same explants. immunostaining for nitrotyrosine correlated with the severity of histological changes to oa cartilage, suggesting a correlation between oxidative damage and articular cartilage degeneration. during continuous culture of chondrocytes, telomere length, replicative capacity and gag production were decreased by treatment with ros. in contrast, treatment with an antioxidative agent resulted in a tendency to elongate telomere length and replicative lifespan in cultured chondrocytes. in tissue cultures of cartilage explants, nitrotyrosine staining, chondrocyte telomere length and gag remaining in the cartilage tissue were lower in ros-treated cartilages than in control groups, whereas the antioxidative agent treated group exhibited a tendency to maintain the chondrocyte telomere length and proteoglycan remaining in the cartilage explants, suggesting that oxidative stress induces chondrocyte telomere instability and catabolic changes in cartilage matrix structure and composition. our findings clearly show that the presence of oxidative stress induces telomere genomic instability, replicative senescence and dysfunction of chondrocytes in oa cartilage, suggesting that oxidative stress, leading to chondrocyte senescence and cartilage ageing, might be responsible for the development of oa. new efforts to prevent the development and progression of oa may include strategies and interventions aimed at reducing oxidative damage in articular cartilage.
the claudin‐16 channel gene is transcriptionally inhibited by 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin d the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (casr) plays a major role in the maintenance of a physiological serum ionized calcium (ca2+) concentration by regulating the circulating levels of parathyroid hormone. it was molecularly identified in 1993 by brown et al. in the laboratory of dr. steven hebert with an expression cloning strategy. subsequent studies have demonstrated that the casr is highly expressed in the kidney, where it is capable of integrating signals deriving from the tubular fluid and/or the interstitial plasma. additional studies elucidating inherited and acquired mutations in the casr gene, the existence of activating and inactivating autoantibodies, and genetic polymorphisms of the casr have greatly enhanced our understanding of the role of the casr in mineral ion metabolism. allosteric modulators of the casr are the first drugs in their class to become available for clinical use and have been shown to treat successfully hyperparathyroidism secondary to advanced renal failure. in addition, preclinical and clinical studies suggest the possibility of using such compounds in various forms of hypercalcemic hyperparathyroidism, such as primary and lithium-induced hyperparathyroidism and that occurring after renal transplantation. this review addresses the role of the casr in kidney physiology and pathophysiology as well as current and in-the-pipeline treatments utilizing casr-based therapeutics.
divergence measures and message passing important inference problems in statistical physics, computer vision, error-correcting coding theory, and artificial intelligence can all be reformulated as the computation of marginal probabilities on factor graphs. the belief propagation (bp) algorithm is an efficient way to solve these problems that is exact when the factor graph is a tree, but only approximate when the factor graph has cycles. we show that bp fixed points correspond to the stationary points of the bethe approximation of the free energy for a factor graph. we explain how to obtain region-based free energy approximations that improve the bethe approximation, and corresponding generalized belief propagation (gbp) algorithms. we emphasize the conditions a free energy approximation must satisfy in order to be a "valid" or "maxent-normal" approximation. we describe the relationship between four different methods that can be used to generate valid approximations: the "bethe method", the "junction graph method", the "cluster variation method", and the "region graph method". finally, we explain how to tell whether a region-based approximation, and its corresponding gbp algorithm, is likely to be accurate, and describe empirical results showing that gbp can significantly outperform bp.
sources of seasonal fractional integration in macroeconomic time series a simple construction that will be referred to as an error-duration model is shown to generate fractional integration and long memory. an error-duration representation also exists for many familiar arma models, making error duration an alternative to autoregression for explaining dynamic persistence in economic variables. the results lead to a straightforward procedure for simulating fractional integration and establish a connection between fractional integration and common notions of structural change. two examples show how the error-duration model could account for fractional integration in aggregate employment and in asset price volatility.
nematode and mercury content in freshwater fish belonging to different trophic levels post minamata incident there has been awareness about mercury toxicity even among the general public. previous researches contributed a vast amount of data regarding acute mercury exposure, but gradually information about the low dose [ninomiya, t., ohmori, h., hashimoto, k., tsuruta, k., ekino, s., 1995. expansion of methylmercury poisoning outside minamata: an epidemiological study on chronic methylmercury poisoninig outside of minamata. environ. res. 70 (1) 47-50; lebel, j., mergler, d., lucotte, m., amorim, m., dolbec, j., miranda, d., arantes, g., rheault, i., pichet, p., 1996. evidence of early nervous system dysfunction in amazonian populations exposed to low-levels of methylmercury. neurotoxicology 17 (1) 157-167] of mercury toxicity has been trickling in. with mercury contaminating rain-, ground- and sea-water no one is safe. polluted water leads to mercury laced fish, meat and vegetable. in aquatic environments, inorganic mercury is microbiologically transformed into lipophilic organic compound 'methylmercury'. this transformation makes mercury more prone to biomagnification in food chains. consequently, populations with traditionally high dietary intake of food originating from fresh or marine environment have highest dietary exposure to mercury. extensive research done on locals across the globe have already established this, persons who routinely consume fish or a particular species of fish are at an increased risk of methylmercury poisoning. the easy access of the toxicant to man through multiple pathways air, water, food, cosmetic products and even vaccines increase the exposure. foetus and children are more susceptible towards mercury toxicity. mothers consuming diet containing mercury pass the toxicant to foetus and to infants through breast milk. decreased performance in areas of motor function and memory has been reported among children exposed to presumably safe mercury levels. similarly, disruption of attention, fine motor function and verbal memory was also found in adults on exposure to low mercury levels. it is an occupational hazard for dental staff, chloralkali factory workers and goldminers, etc. mercury has been found to be a causative agent of various sorts of disorders, including neurological, nephrological, immunological, cardiac, motor, reproductive and even genetic. recently heavy metal mediated toxicity has been linked to diseases like alzeihemer's, parkinson's, autism, lupus, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, etc. besides this, it poses danger to wildlife. therefore, it becomes imperative to spread the information regarding the threat of mercury exposure amongst the scientists and masses.
applications of shunt facts controller for voltage stability improvment in allusion to the “on-line beforehand decision-making, real time matching”, this paper proposes the stability control flow based on pmu for interconnected power system, which is a real-time stability control. in this scheme, preventive control, emergency control and corrective control are designed to a closed-loop rolling control process, it will protect the stability of power system. then it ameliorates the corrective control process, and presents a new control method which is based on pmu and eeac method. this scheme can ensure the real-time quality and advance the veracity for the corrective control.
generalized likelihood ratio statistics and uncertainty adjustments in efficient adaptive design of clinical trials adaptive designs have been proposed for clinical trials in which the nuisance parameters or alternative of interest are unknown or likely to be misspecified before the trial. although most previous works on adaptive designs and mid-course sample size re-estimation have focused on two-stage or group-sequential designs in the normal case, we consider here a new approach that involves at most three stages and is developed in the general framework of multiparameter exponential families. this approach not only maintains the prescribed type i error probability but also provides a simple but asymptotically efficient sequential test whose finite-sample performance, measured in terms of the expected sample size and power functions, is shown to be comparable to the optimal sequential design, determined by dynamic programming, in the simplified normal mean case with known variance and prespecified alternative, and superior to the existing two-stage designs and also to adaptive group-sequential designs when the alternative or nuisance parameters are unknown or misspecified.
a nuclear role for the respiratory enzyme clk-1/coq7 in regulating mitochondrial stress responses and longevity we have identified three allelic, maternal-effect mutations that affect developmental and behavioral timing in caenorhabditis elegans. they result in a mean lengthening of embryonic and postembryonic development, the cell cycle period and life span, as well as the periods of the defecation, swimming and pumping cycles. these mutants also display a number of additional phenotypes related to timing. for example, the variability in the length of embryonic development is several times larger in the mutants than in the wild type, resulting in the occasional production of mutant embryos developing more rapidly than the most rapidly developing wild-type embryos. in addition, the duration of embryonic development of the mutants, but not of the wild type, depends on the temperature at which their parents were raised. finally, individual variations in the severity of distinct mutant phenotypes are correlated in a counterintuitive way. for example, the animals with the shortest embryonic development have the longest defecation cycle and those with the longest embryonic development have the shortest defecation cycle. most of the features affected by these mutations are believed to be controlled by biological clocks, and we therefore call the gene defined by these mutations clk-1, for "abnormal function of biological clocks."

spatio-temporal distribution of aedes aegypti (diptera: culicidae) mitochondrial lineages in cities with distinct dengue incidence rates suggests complex population dynamics of the dengue vector in colombia background existing theoretical models of the potential effects of climate change on vector-borne diseases do not account for social factors such as population increase, or interactions between climate variables. our aim was to investigate the potential effects of global climate change on human health, and in particular, on the transmission of vector-borne diseases.   methods we modelled the reported global distribution of dengue fever on the basis of vapour pressure, which is a measure of humidity. we assessed changes in the geographical limits of dengue fever transmission, and in the number of people at risk of dengue by incorporating future climate change and human population projections into our model.   findings we showed that the current geographical limits of dengue fever transmission can be modelled with 89% accuracy on the basis of long-term average vapour pressure. in 1990, almost 30% of the world population, 1.5 billion people, lived in regions where the estimated risk of dengue transmission was greater than 50%. with population and climate change projections for 2085, we estimate that about 5-6 billion people (50-60% of the projected global population) would be at risk of dengue transmission, compared with 3.5 billion people, or 35% of the population, if climate change did not happen.   interpretation we conclude that climate change is likely to increase the area of land with a climate suitable for dengue fever transmission, and that if no other contributing factors were to change, a large proportion of the human population would then be put at risk.

an algorithm for mining weighted dense maximal 1-complete regions mining frequent closed itemsets provides complete and non-redundant results for frequent pattern analysis. extensive studies have proposed various strategies for efficient frequent closed itemset mining, such as depth-first search vs. breadthfirst search, vertical formats vs. horizontal formats, tree-structure vs. other data structures, top-down vs. bottom-up traversal, pseudo projection vs. physical projection of conditional database, etc. it is the right time to ask "what are the pros and cons of the strategies?" and "what and how can we pick and integrate the best strategies to achieve higher performance in general cases?"in this study, we answer the above questions by a systematic study of the search strategies and develop a winning algorithm closet+. closet+ integrates the advantages of the previously proposed effective strategies as well as some ones newly developed here. a thorough performance study on synthetic and real data sets has shown the advantages of the strategies and the improvement of closet+ over existing mining algorithms, including closet, charm and op, in terms of runtime, memory usage and scalability.
alternative interventions to prevent oxidative damage following ischemia/reperfusion oxidative stress is considered a major contributor to etiology of both “normal” senescence and severe pathologies with serious public health implications. mitochondria generate reactive oxygen species (ros) that are thought to augment intracellular oxidative stress. mitochondria possess at least nine known sites that are capable of generating superoxide anion, a progenitor ros. mitochondria also possess numerous ros defense systems that are much less studied. studies of the last three decades shed light on many important mechanistic details of mitochondrial ros production, but the bigger picture remains obscure. this review summarizes the current knowledge about major components involved in mitochondrial ros metabolism and factors that regulate ros generation and removal. an integrative, systemic approach is applied to analysis of mitochondrial ros metabolism, which is now dissected into mitochondrial ros production, mitochondrial ros removal, and mitochondrial ros emission. it is suggested that mitochondria augment intracellular oxidative stress due primarily to failure of their ros removal systems, whereas the role of mitochondrial ros emission is yet to be determined and a net increase in mitochondrial ros production in situ remains to be demonstrated.
indomethacin pharmacodynamics are altered by surfactant: a possible challenge to current indomethacin dosing guidelines created before surfactant availability objective we conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial to determine whether higher doses of indomethacin would improve the rate of patent ductus arteriosus (pda) closure.   study design infants (<28 weeks gestation) who received a conventional, prophylactic 3-dose course of indomethacin were eligible if they had continued evidence of persistent ductus patency on an echocardiogram obtained before the third prophylactic indomethacin dose. infants (n = 105) were randomized to receive an extended 3-day course of either low-dose (0.1 mg/kg/d) or higher-dose (0.2 or 0.5 mg/kg/d) indomethacin. an echocardiogram was obtained 24 hours after the last dose of study drug.   results despite increasing serum indomethacin concentrations by 2.9-fold in the higher-dose group, we failed to detect a significant decrease in the rate of persistent pda (low = 52%; higher = 45%, p = .50). the higher-dose group had a significantly higher occurrence of serum creatinine >2 mg/100 ml (low = 6%, higher = 19%, p < .05) and moderate/severe retinopathy of prematurity (rop) (low = 15%, higher = 36%, p < .025). the incidence of moderate/severe rop was directly related to the poststudy indomethacin concentrations (odds ratio = 1.75, confidence interval: 1.15-2.68, p < .01).   conclusion increasing indomethacin concentrations above the levels achieved with a conventional dosing regimen had little effect on the rate of pda closure but was associated with higher rates of moderate/severe rop and renal compromise.
glutamate receptor antibodies directed against ampa receptors subunit 3 peptide b (glur3b) can be produced in dba/2j mice, lower seizure threshold and induce abnormal behavior glutamate is the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and, as such, it inevitably plays a role in the initiation and spread of seizure activity. it also plays a critical role in epileptogenesis. the process of ‘kindling’ limbic seizures in rodents by repeated electrical stimulation is dependent on activation of n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptors. the function of these receptors is enhanced in the hippocampus of kindled rats and in the cerebral cortex of patients with focal epilepsy. microdialysis studies show an increase in the extracellular concentration of glutamate and aspartate before or during seizure onset, suggesting that either enhanced amino acid release or impaired uptake contributes to seizure initiation. glutamate antagonists selective for nmda or non-nmda receptors are potent anticonvulsants when given systemically in a wide variety of animal models of epilepsy. they are of limited efficacy against kindled seizures in rats and (on the basis of preliminary evidence) in patients with drug-refractory complex partial seizures. cognitive side effects appear to be a significant problem with competitive, as well as noncompetitive, nmda antagonists. glutamate receptor antagonists provide significant protection against brain damage following global or focal cerebral ischemia or acute traumatic injury in rodent models. anticonvulsant compounds of the lamotrigine type, which act on sodium channels and reduce ischemia-induced glutamate release, are cerebroprotective in rodent ischemia models and are free from the cognitive side effects of nmda-receptor antagonists.
the inability of bacillus licheniformis perr mutant to grow is mainly due to the lack of perr-mediated fur repression perr is a ferric uptake repressor (fur) homolog that functions as the central regulator of the inducible peroxide stress response in bacillus subtilis. perr has been previously demonstrated to regulate the mrga, kata, ahpcf, hemaxcdbl, and zosa genes. we now demonstrate that perr also mediates both the repression of its own gene and that of fur. whereas perr-mediated repression of most target genes can be elicited by either manganese or iron, repression of perr and fur is selective for manganese. genetic studies indicate that repression of perr regulon genes by either manganese or iron requires perr and is generally independent of fur. indeed, in a fur mutant, iron-mediated repression is enhanced. unexpectedly, repression of the fur gene by manganese appears to require both perr and fur, but only perr binds to the fur regulatory region in vitro. the fur mutation appears to act indirectly by affecting cellular metal ion pools and thereby affecting perr-mediated repression. while many components of the perr regulon are strongly induced by hydrogen peroxide, little, if any, induction of fur and perr could be demonstrated. thus, not all components of the perr regulon are components of the peroxide stimulon. we suggest that perr exists in distinct metallated forms that differ in dna target selectivity and in sensitivity to oxidation. this model is supported by the observation that the metal ion composition of the growth medium can greatly influence the transcriptional response of the various perr regulon genes to hydrogen peroxide.
a interaction with the cxcr 4 third intracellular loop regulates endocytosis and signaling of wt and whim-like receptors chemotaxis mediated by chemokine receptors such as cxcr4 plays a key role in lymphocyte homing and hematopoiesis as well as in breast cancer metastasis. we have demonstrated previously that β-arrestin2 functions to attenuate cxcr4-mediated g protein activation and to enhance cxcr4 internalization. here we show further that the expression of β-arrestin2 in both hela and human embryonic kidney 293 cells significantly enhances the chemotactic efficacy of stromal cell-derived factor 1α, the specific agonist of cxcr4, whereas the suppression of β-arrestin2 endogenous expression by antisense or rna-mediated interference technology considerably attenuates stromal cell-derived factor 1α-induced cell migration. expression of β-arrestin2 also augmented chemokine receptor ccr5-mediated but not epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated chemotaxis, indicating the specific effect of β-arrestin2. further analysis reveals that expression of β-arrestin2 strengthened cxcr4-mediated activation of both p38 mapk and erk, and the suppression of β-arrestin2 expression blocked the activation of two kinases. interestingly, inhibition of p38 mapk activation (but not erk activation) by its inhibitors or by expression of a dominant-negative mutant of p38 mapk effectively blocked the chemotactic effect of β-arrestin2. expression of a dominant-negative mutant of ask1 also exerted the similar blocking effect. the results of our study suggest that β-arrestin2 can function not only as a regulator of cxcr4 signaling but also as a mediator of stromal cell-derived factor 1α-induced chemotaxis and that this activity probably occurs via the ask1/p38 mapk pathway.
ku protein levels, localization and association to replication origins in different stages of breast tumor progression dna-dependent protein kinase (dna-pk) has been implicated in several nuclear processes including transcription1–3, dna replication4,5, double-stranded dna break repair, and v(d) j recombination6–10. linkage of kinase and substrate on dna in cis is required for efficient phosphorylation11. recruitment of dna-pk to dna is by ku autoantigen, a dna-end-binding protein required for dna-pk catalytic activity11. although ku is known to translocate along naked dna12, how dna-end binding by ku might lead to dna-pk-mediated phosphorylation of sequence-specific dna-binding proteins in vivo has not been obvious. here we report the identification of ku as a transcription factor that recruits dna-pk directly to specific dna sequences. nre1 (negative regulatory element 1) is a dna sequence element (−394/ − 381) in the long terminal repeat of mouse mammary tumour virus (mmtv) that is important for repressing inappropriate viral expression13–16. we show that direct binding of ku/dna-pk to nre1 represses glucocorticoid-induced mmtv transcription.
enhanced sleep reverses memory deficits and underlying pathology in drosophila models of alzheimer's disease work in animals and humans has suggested the existence of a slow wave sleep (sws)-promoting/electroencephalogram (eeg)-synchronizing center in the mammalian lower brainstem. although sleep-active gabaergic neurons in the medullary parafacial zone (pz) are needed for normal sws, it remains unclear whether these neurons can initiate and maintain sws or eeg slow-wave activity (swa) in behaving mice. we used genetically targeted activation and optogenetically based mapping to examine the downstream circuitry engaged by sws-promoting pz neurons, and we found that this circuit uniquely and potently initiated sws and eeg swa, regardless of the time of day. pz neurons monosynaptically innervated and released synaptic gaba onto parabrachial neurons, which in turn projected to and released synaptic glutamate onto cortically projecting neurons of the magnocellular basal forebrain; thus, there is a circuit substrate through which gabaergic pz neurons can potently trigger sws and modulate the cortical eeg.
in vivo rna interference screens identify regulators of antiviral cd4(+) and cd8(+) t cell differentiation. t follicular helper cell differentiation when b cells respond to an infection, they often require help from cd4+ t cells to mount a proper response. it is thought that a subset of cd4+ effector t cells, called t follicular helper cells (tfh), performs this function. several subsets of effector cd4+ t cells arise, depending on the type of infection, which have distinct transcriptional programs driving their differentiation. whether this is also the case for tfh cells has not been clear (see the perspective by awasthi and kuchroo). nurieva et al. (p. 1001, published online 23 july) and johnston et al. (p. 1006; published online 16 july) now demonstrate that the transcription factor bcl6 is both necessary and sufficient for tfh differentiation and subsequent b cell–mediated immunity, suggesting that it is a master regulator of this lineage. johnston et al. also show that expression of bcl6 and the transcription factor, blimp-1, are reciprocally regulated in tfh cells and that, when ectopically expressed, blimp-1 inhibits tfh development. the transcription factors that regulate follicular t helper cell differentiation are identified. effective b cell–mediated immunity and antibody responses often require help from cd4+ t cells. it is thought that a distinct cd4+ effector t cell subset, called t follicular helper cells (tfh), provides this help; however, the molecular requirements for tfh differentiation are unknown. we found that expression of the transcription factor bcl6 in cd4+ t cells is both necessary and sufficient for in vivo tfh differentiation and t cell help to b cells in mice. in contrast, the transcription factor blimp-1, an antagonist of bcl6, inhibits tfh differentiation and help, thereby preventing b cell germinal center and antibody responses. these findings demonstrate that tfh cells are required for proper b cell responses in vivo and that bcl6 and blimp-1 play central but opposing roles in tfh differentiation.
decentralized replicated-object protocols bayou is a replicated, weakly consistent storage system designed for a mobile computing environment that includes portable machines with less than ideal network connectivity. to maximize availability, users can read and write any accessible replica. bayou’s design has focused on supporting application-specific mechanisms to detect and resolve the update conflicts that naturally arise in such a system, ensuring that replicas move towards eventual consistency, and defining a protocol by which the resolution of update conflicts stabilizes. it includes novel methods for conflict detection, called dependency checks, and per -write conflict resolution based on client-provid ed mer ge procedures. to guarantee eventual consistency, bayou servers must be able to rollback the effects of previously executed writes and redo them according to a global serialization order . furthermore, bayou permits clients to observe the results of all writes received by a server , including tentative writes whose conflicts have not been ultimately resolved. this paper presents the motivation for and design of these mechanisms and describes the experiences gained with an initial implementation of the system.
behavioral responses in mice selectively bred for high and low levels of open-field thigmotaxis an overview of ethologically-based animal models suitable for investigating the pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders is presented. the dsm-iiir classification provides a framework for the discussion. the limitations of the models in current use are considered. it is suggested that there is a need for a greater emphasis on animal models of anxiety with an etiological basis.
possible involvement of downregulation of the apelin-apj system in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. aims active autophagy has recently been reported in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity; here we investigated its pathophysiological role.   methods and results acute cardiotoxicity was induced in green fluorescent protein-microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (gfp-lc3) transgenic mice by administering two intraperitoneal injections of 10 mg/kg doxorubicin with a 3 day interval. a starvation group was deprived of food for 48 h before each injection to induce autophagy in advance. doxorubicin treatment caused left ventricular dilatation and dysfunction within 6 days. cardiomyocyte autophagy appeared to be activated in the doxorubicin group, based on lc3, p62, and cathepsin d expression, while it seemed somewhat diminished by starvation prior to doxorubicin treatment. unexpectedly, however, myocardial atp levels were reduced in the doxorubicin group, and this reduction was prevented by earlier starvation. electron microscopy revealed that the autophagic process was indeed initiated in the doxorubicin group, as shown by the increased lysosomes, but was not completed, i.e. autophagolysosome formation was rare. starvation prior to doxorubicin treatment partly restored autophagosome formation towards control levels. autophagic flux assays in both in vivo and in vitro models confirmed that doxorubicin impairs completion of the autophagic process in cardiomyocytes. the activities of both amp-activated protein kinase and the autophagy-initiating kinase unc-51-like kinase 1 (ulk1) were found to be decreased by doxorubicin, and these were restored by prior starvation.   conclusion prior starvation mitigates acute doxorubicin cardiotoxicity; the underlying mechanism may be, at least in part, restoration and further augmentation of myocardial autophagy, which is impaired by doxorubicin, probably through inactivation of amp-activated protein kinase and ulk1.
estrogen receptors in prolactinomas: a clinico-pathological study prolactinomas can be induced in rats by large doses of estrogens. whether prolactinomas can be induced in humans by estrogens, however, is not known. this report describes the development of a prolactinoma in a man with previously normal plasma prl levels after the administration of pharmacological doses of estrogen. the patient, a 26-yr-old male to female transsexual, took cyproterone acetate (100 mg/day, orally) and ethinyl estradiol (100 micrograms/day, orally) for 10 months and (surrepititiously) estradiol-17-undecanoate (100 mg, twice weekly, im) for about 6 of the 10 months. plasma prl levels rose from 0.05 to 5.20 u/l within 10 months (normal, 0.05-0.30 u/l). a computed tomographic scan showed a pituitary mass with suprasellar extension. after all estrogen therapy was discontinued, his plasma estradiol levels gradually declined from 2.8 to 0.77 nmol/l (normal, 0.04-0.12 nmol/l), but prl levels rose further to 6.2 u/l. bromocriptine treatment (2.5 mg twice daily) then was given. plasma prl fell gradually to 0.43 u/l and a computed tomographic scan after 5 months showed reduction in tumor size. the patient then discontinued bromocriptine treatment. four months later his plasma estradiol level was normal, while plasma prl had risen to 4.6 u/l, indicating autonomous prl secretion. we conclude that 1) estrogen in pharmacological doses can induce prolactinomas in man; and 2) subjects treated with high doses of estrogen must, therefore, be surveyed for the development of such tumors.
mechanical performance of an in situ perfused heart from the turtle chrysemys scripta during normoxia and anoxia at 5 c and 15 c 1. in both pseudemys and testudo, blood pressures are identical in all chambers of the ventricle. systolic pressures are not measurably different in the ventricle and systemic arteries but are 0-5-2-0 cm h2o lower in the pulmonary artery due to the resistance of the pulmonary outflow tract. diastolic pressures are the same in all systemic arteries but are substantially lower in the pulmonary artery. it is concluded that the systemic and pulmonary circulations are perfused by a single pump during both apnoea and lung ventilation. 2. flow profiles in pulmonary and systemic arteries are characteristicallly different. substantial changes in cardiac output may occur during intermittent breathing and apnoea, especially if there are large fluctuations in heart rate. pulmonary flow increases during lung ventilation due to vasodilation of the lung vasculature. systemic is also affected though the increase is usually smaller. 3. any separation in the blood pumped by the single ventricle must be maintained by laminar flow patterns and the composition of the blood in each of the major arteries should reflect their relationship to these patterns.
an eguchipsammia (dendrophylliidae) topping on the cone cold-water corals are widely considered as important structural components of benthic habitats, potentially enhancing local abundance in a variety of fish and invertebrate species. yet, current knowledge of the taxonomic diversity and distribution patterns of these vulnerable, slow-growing organisms is scarce and fragmented, limiting the effectiveness of spatial management and conservation measures. we have conducted an exhaustive compilation of records of alcyonaceans, antipatharians, scleractinians and stylasterids available through present day to assess the diversity, distribution and spatial structure of coral assemblages in the azores exclusive economic zone (eez). the resulting database comprises 2501 entries concerning historical oceanographic expeditions and other published sources, as well as unpublished data from bottom longline by-catch. our taxonomic inventory appears to be fairly complete for the explored habitats, accounting for 164 species (79 alcyonaceans, 58 scleractinians, 18 antipatharians and 9 stylasterids), nine of which were documented for the first time. the azores eez harbours a mixed coral fauna with several zoogeographic origins, showing the closest affinity with the lusitanian–mediterranean region. very few apparent endemics were found (14%), and only in part supported by consistent sampling. coral diversity is particularly high between 300 and 900 m depths, in areas recognized as traditional fishing grounds or exploitable fish habitat within the 100-mile limit of the eez. the composition of coral assemblages shows significant geographical structure among longitudinal sections of the study area at comparable depths (100–1500 m). there is no evidence of a possible role of the mid-atlantic ridge or latitudinal effects underlying this pattern, which suggests that it may instead reflect assemblage variability among features. stronger changes in species composition were found along the bathymetric gradient. notwithstanding the mix of partially overlapping steno- and eurybathic species that characterize the vertical distribution of corals, there is a distinct transition from shallow (100–600 m) to intermediate (600–1000 m) depths. the analysis presented here constitutes a valuable contribution for efficient conservation policies of coral-associated vulnerable marine ecosystems and their sustainable use as fishing areas.
ho x observations over west africa during amma: impact of isoprene and no x the measurement of oh reactivity, the inverse of the oh lifetime, provides a powerful tool to investigate atmospheric photochemistry. a new airborne oh reactivity instrument was designed and deployed for the first time on the nasa dc-8 aircraft during the second phase of inter- continental chemical transport experiment-b (intex-b) campaign, which was focused on the asian pollution out- flow over pacific ocean and was based in hawaii and alaska. the oh reactivity was measured by adding oh, generated by photolyzing water vapor with 185 nm uv light in a moveable wand, to the flow of ambient air in a flow tube and mea- suring the oh signal with laser induced fluorescence. as the wand was pulled back away from the oh detector, the oh signal decay was recorded; the slope of 1ln(signal)/1 time was the oh reactivity. the overall absolute uncer- tainty at the 2 confidence levels is about 1 s 1 at low al- titudes (for decay about 6 s 1 ), and 0.7 s 1 at high altitudes (for decay about 2 s 1 ). from the median vertical profile obtained in the second phase of intex-b, the measured oh reactivity (4.0±1.0 s 1 ) is higher than the oh reactiv-
genetic network identifies novel pathways contributing to atherosclerosis susceptibility in the innominate artery abstract—most previous studies of atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic mouse models have focused their investigations on lesions within the aorta or aortic sinus in young animals. none of these studies has demonstrated clinically significant advanced lesions. we previously mapped the distribution of lesions throughout the arterial tree of apolipoprotein e knockout (apoe−/−) mice between the ages of 24 and 60 weeks. we found that the innominate artery, a small vessel connecting the aortic arch to the right subclavian and right carotid artery, exhibits a highly consistent rate of lesion progression and develops a narrowed vessel characterized by atrophic media and perivascular inflammation. the present study reports the characteristics of advanced lesions in the innominate artery of apoe−/− mice aged 42 to 60 weeks. in animals aged 42 to 54 weeks, there is a very high frequency of intraplaque hemorrhage and a fibrotic conversion of necrotic zones accompanied by loss of the fibrous cap. by 60 weeks of age, the lesions are characterized by the presence of collagen-rich fibrofatty nodules often flanked by lateral xanthomas. the processes underlying these changes in the innominate artery of older apoe−/− mice could well be a model for the critical processes leading to the breakdown and healing of the human atherosclerotic plaque.
polling with physical envelopes: a rigorous analysis of a human-centric protocol a survey technique for improving the reliability of responses to sensitive interview questions is described. the technique permits the respondentto answer "yes" or "no" to a question without the interviewer knowing what informationis being conveyed by the respondent. the privacy of the interviewee is protected by randomizing his response. for example if all members of a population belong either to group a or to group b and the investigator wants to determine the proportion of group a individuals in the population, this information can be elicited by using the following procedures. before each interview, the respondent is provided with a spinner marked with a point a and a point b. the spinner is marked off in such a way that the spinner's marker will stop at point a with a probability of p and at point b with a probability of 1-p. when the interviewer asks the sensitive question concerning group membership, the respondent spins the spinner out of the sight of the interviewer. the marker will either stop at point a or point b. the respondent then indicates whether or not he belongs to the group to which the marker is pointing. the respondent does not tell the interviewer where the marker is pointing. assuming that these responses are truthful, it is then possible to determine maximum likelihood estimates of the true proportion of as in the population. the formula for calculating these estimates is provided. both the degree of truthfulness which can be expected from the respondents and the sample size required for given levels of precision depends on the parameter p.
computerized diagnosis of respiratory disorders. svm based classification of var model parameters of respiratory sounds. in this study, a novel approach is proposed, the imaging of crackle sounds distribution on the thorax based on processing techniques that could contend with the detection and count of crackles; hence, the normalized fractal dimension (nfd), the univariate ar modeling combined with a supervised neural network (uar-snn), and the time-variant autoregressive (tvar) model were assessed. the proposed processing schemes were tested inserting simulated crackles in normal lung sounds acquired by a multichannel system on the posterior thoracic surface. in order to evaluate the robustness of the processing schemes, different scenarios were created by manipulating the number of crackles, the type of crackles, the spatial distribution, and the signal to noise ratio (snr) at different pulmonary regions. the results indicate that tvar scheme showed the best performance, compared with nfd and uar-snn schemes, for detecting and counting simulated crackles with an average specificity very close to 100%, and average sensitivity of 98 ± 7.5% even with overlapped crackles and with snr corresponding to a scaling factor as low as 1.5. finally, the performance of the tvar scheme was tested against a human expert using simulated and real acoustic information. we conclude that a confident image of crackle sounds distribution by crackles counting using tvar on the thoracic surface is thoroughly possible. the crackles imaging might represent an aid to the clinical evaluation of pulmonary diseases that produce this sort of adventitious discontinuous lung sounds.
the combination of mln2238 (ixazomib) with interferon-alpha results in enhanced cell death in melanoma purpose: the success of bortezomib therapy for treatment of multiple myeloma (mm) led to the development of structurally and pharmacologically distinct novel proteasome inhibitors. in the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of one such novel orally bioactive proteasome inhibitor mln9708/mln2238 in mm using well-established in vitro and in vivo models. experimental design: mm cell lines, primary patient cells, and the human mm xenograft animal model were used to study the antitumor activity of mn2238. results: treatment of mm cells with mln2238 predominantly inhibits chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome and induces accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. mln2238 inhibits growth and induces apoptosis in mm cells resistant to conventional and bortezomib therapies without affecting the viability of normal cells. in animal tumor model studies, mln2238 is well tolerated and inhibits tumor growth with significantly reduced tumor recurrence. a head-to-head analysis of mln2238 versus bortezomib showed a significantly longer survival time in mice treated with mln2238 than mice receiving bortezomib. immununostaining of mm tumors from mln2238-treated mice showed growth inhibition, apoptosis, and a decrease in associated angiogenesis. mechanistic studies showed that mln2238-triggered apoptosis is associated with activation of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9; increase in p53, p21, noxa, puma, and e2f; induction of endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress response proteins bip, phospho-eif2-α, and chop; and inhibition of nuclear factor kappa b. finally, combining mln2238 with lenalidomide, histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, or dexamethasone triggers synergistic anti-mm activity. conclusion: our preclinical study supports clinical evaluation of mln9708, alone or in combination, as a potential mm therapy. clin cancer res; 17(16); 5311–21. ©2011 aacr.
kernel conditional exponential family in this paper, we consider an infinite dimensional exponential family, $\mathcal{p}$ of probability densities, which are parametrized by functions in a reproducing kernel hilbert space, $h$ and show it to be quite rich in the sense that a broad class of densities on $\mathbb{r}^d$ can be approximated arbitrarily well in kullback-leibler (kl) divergence by elements in $\mathcal{p}$. the main goal of the paper is to estimate an unknown density, $p_0$ through an element in $\mathcal{p}$. standard techniques like maximum likelihood estimation (mle) or pseudo mle (based on the method of sieves), which are based on minimizing the kl divergence between $p_0$ and $\mathcal{p}$, do not yield practically useful estimators because of their inability to efficiently handle the log-partition function. instead, we propose an estimator, $\hat{p}_n$ based on minimizing the \emph{fisher divergence}, $j(p_0\vert p)$ between $p_0$ and $p\in \mathcal{p}$, which involves solving a simple finite-dimensional linear system. when $p_0\in\mathcal{p}$, we show that the proposed estimator is consistent, and provide a convergence rate of $n^{-\min\left\{\frac{2}{3},\frac{2\beta+1}{2\beta+2}\right\}}$ in fisher divergence under the smoothness assumption that $\log p_0\in\mathcal{r}(c^\beta)$ for some $\beta\ge 0$, where $c$ is a certain hilbert-schmidt operator on $h$ and $\mathcal{r}(c^\beta)$ denotes the image of $c^\beta$. we also investigate the misspecified case of $p_0\notin\mathcal{p}$ and show that $j(p_0\vert\hat{p}_n)\rightarrow \inf_{p\in\mathcal{p}}j(p_0\vert p)$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$, and provide a rate for this convergence under a similar smoothness condition as above. through numerical simulations we demonstrate that the proposed estimator outperforms the non-parametric kernel density estimator, and that the advantage with the proposed estimator grows as $d$ increases.
analysis of triaxial well-logging sensors in layered anisotropic earth formations early development of marine electromagnetic methods, dating back about 80 years, was driven largely by defense/military applications, and use for these purposes continues to this day. deepwater, frequency-domain, electric dipole-dipole, controlled-source electromagnetic csem methods arose from academic studies of the oceanic lithosphere in the 1980s, and although the hydrocarbon exploration industry was aware of this work, the shallow-water environments being explored at that time were not ideally suited for its use. low oil prices and increasingly successful results from 3d seismic methods further discouraged investment in costly alternative geophysical data streams. these circumstances changed in the late 1990s, when both statoil and exxonmobil began modeling studies and field
immunohistochemical characteristics and distribution of neurons in the intramural ganglia supplying the urinary bladder in the male pig. summarythe fine structure of the muscle of the urinary bladder in female rats is similar to that of other visceral muscles, although it is arranged in bundles of variable length, cross-section and orientation, forming a meshwork. when distended, the musculature is 100–120 μm thick, with some variation and occasional discontinuity. extended areas of cell-to-cell apposition with uniform intercellular space occur between muscle cells, whereas attachment plaques for mechanical coupling are less common than in other visceral muscles. there are no gap junctions between muscle cells. many bundles of microfilaments and small elastic fibres run between the muscle cells. after chronic partial obstruction of the urethra, the bladder enlarges and is about 15 times heavier, but has the same shape as in controls; the growth is mainly accounted for by muscle hypertrophy. the outer surface of the hypertrophic bladder is increased 6-fold over the controls; the muscle is increased 3-fold in thickness, and is more compact. mitoses are not found, but there is a massive increase in muscle cell size. there is a modest decrease in percentage volume of mitochondria, an increase in sarcoplasmic reticulum, and no appreciable change in the pattern of myofilaments. gap junctions between hypertrophic muscle cells are virtually absent. intramuscular nerve fibres and vesicle-containing varicosities appear as common in the hypertrophic muscle as in controls. there is no infiltration of the muscle by connective tissue and no significant occurrence of muscle cell death.
size matters: genital allometry in an african mole-rat (family: bathyergidae) the interaction between functional and mechanistic approaches to sperm competition and between male and female perspectives are described and illustrated by a study of the zebra finch, taeniopygia guttata. sperm competition experiments in the laboratory show that last male sperm precedence occurs (as it does in many other taxa) although the mechanism is unknown (as in most other taxa). empirically-derived values were used to construct a mathematical model of sperm competition in the zebra finch. the model indicates that precedence occurs as a consequence of: (i) the temporal pattern of pair copulations; (ii) the rate at which sperm are lost from the female tract; and (iii) more sperm being transferred during extra-pair copulations than during pair copulations. the latter effect is a consequence of males seeking extra-pair copulations after their own pair copulation period has ended. the effect of sperm numbers on the pattern of sperm precedence may be further increased by: (i) extra-pair males increasing ejaculate size (sperm numbers) (for which there is no evidence); (ii) extra-pair males being of a better quality and transferring more sperm or better quality sperm (for which there is some evidence); and (iii) cryptic female choice. females eject over 99% of sperm following insemination; if they eject fewer sperm from males chosen as extra-pair copulation partners, the potential for cryptic female choice is considerable. however, this is still being investigated. the model also predicts the optimal time for an extra-pair copulation to occur (from either a male or female perspective). a comparison between the predicted and observed pattern suggests that the optimal timing of extra-pair copulations is constrained in both sexes.
assessing base rates of sexual behavior using the unmatched count technique assessing sexual behavior with self-report is essential to research on a variety of health topics, including pregnancy and infertility, sexually transmitted infections, and sexual health and functioning. recent methodological research has provided new insights regarding the accuracy of self-reports of sexual behavior. we review these studies, paying particular attention to a promising new development: the use of computer-assisted assessments. the collection of sexual risk behavior data with computers has increased dramatically in recent years, but little is known about the accuracy of such assessments. we summarize the evidence, discuss methodological issues that arise in studies evaluating the accuracy of self-reports, and offer recommendations for future research.
time and frequency localized pulse shape for resolution enhancement in stft-botdr brillouin scattering in optical fiber describes the interaction of an electro-magnetic field (photon) with a characteristic density variation of the fiber. when the electric field amplitude of an optical beam (so-called pump wave), and another wave is introduced at the downshifted brillouin frequency (namely stokes wave), the beating between the pump and stokes waves creates a modified density change via the electrostriction effect, resulting in so-called the stimulated brillouin scattering. the density variation is associated with a mechanical acoustic wave; and it may be affected by local temperature, strain, and vibration which induce changes in the fiber effective refractive index and sound velocity. through the measurement of the static or dynamic changes in brillouin frequency along the fiber one can realize a distributed fiber sensor for local temperature, strain and vibration over tens or hundreds of kilometers. this paper reviews the progress on improving sensing performance parameters like spatial resolution, sensing length limitation and simultaneous temperature and strain measurement. these kinds of sensors can be used in civil structural monitoring of pipelines, bridges, dams, and railroads for disaster prevention. analogous to the static bragg grating, one can write a moving brillouin grating in fibers, with the lifetime of the acoustic wave. the length of the brillouin grating can be controlled by the writing pulses at any position in fibers. such gratings can be used to measure changes in birefringence, which is an important parameter in fiber communications. applications for this kind of sensor can be found in aerospace, material processing and fine structures.
convergent validity of bibliometric google scholar data in the field of chemistry - citation counts for papers that were accepted by angewandte chemie international edition or rejected but published elsewhere, using google scholar, science citation index, scopus, and chemical abstracts a thermostable dna polymerase was used in an in vitro dna amplification procedure, the polymerase chain reaction. the enzyme, isolated from thermus aquaticus, greatly simplifies the procedure and, by enabling the amplification reaction to be performed at higher temperatures, significantly improves the specificity, yield, sensitivity, and length of products that can be amplified. single-copy genomic sequences were amplified by a factor of more than 10 million with very high specificity, and dna segments up to 2000 base pairs were readily amplified. in addition, the method was used to amplify and detect a target dna molecule present only once in a sample of 10(5) cells.
the choice of methods in determining the optimal cut-off value for quantitative diagnostic test evaluation both obesity and breast cancer incidence increased dramatically during two recent decades in a rapidly changing society in northern iran. in this study, we examined the ability of body mass index (bmi) and waist circumference (wc) as predictor biomarkers of breast cancer risk in iranian women. in a case–control study of 100 new cases of histological confirmed breast cancer and 200 age-matched controls, in babol, we measured weight, height, waist and hip circumference at time of diagnosis with standard methods. the data of demographic, characteristics, reproductive and lifestyle factors were collected by interview. we used both regression and receiver operator characteristics (roc) analysis to estimate the predictive ability of bmi and wc for breast cancer as estimated by area under the curve (auc). the results showed a significant difference in the mean of weight, bmi and wc between patients and controls in pre- and postmenopausal women (p < 0.001). while after adjusting for bmi, no longer an association between wc and breast cancer was found. the overall accuracy of observed bmi and wc were 0.79 (95% ci: 0.74–0.84) and 0.68 (95% ci: 0.61–0.74), respectively. the accuracy of bmi and wc were 0.82 (95% ci: 0.76–0.89), 0.75(0.67–0.83) for premenopausal and 0.77(0.68–0.85), 0.60 (0.50–0.71) for postmenopausal women, respectively. bmi and wc are predictor biomarkers of breast cancer risk in both pre- and postmenopausal iranian women while after adjusting for bmi, no longer an association between wc and breast cancer was observed. these findings imply to perform breast cancer screening program in women with a higher bmi and wc.
regioselective carboxylation of 1,3-dihydroxybenzene by 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate decarboxylase of pandoraea sp. 12b-2 a nonoxidative decarboxylase, 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate decarboxylase, was found in agrobacterium tumefaciens iam12048. the enzyme activity was induced specifically by 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate. the purified enzyme was a homotetramer of identical 38 kda subunits. the purified decarboxylase catalyzed the nonoxidative decarboxylation of 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate without requiring any cofactors. in the presence of khco3, the enzyme also catalyzed the regioselective carboxylation of 1,3-dihydroxybenzene into 2,6-dihydroxybenzoate at a molar conversion ratio of 30%.
the role of g protein coupled receptor kinases in neurocardiovascular pathophysiology in the mammalian heart, cardiac function is under the control of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. all regions of the mammalian heart are innervated by parasympathetic (vagal) nerves, although the supraventricular tissues are more densely innervated than the ventricles. vagal activation causes stimulation of cardiac muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (m-chr) that modulate pacemaker activity via i(f) and i(k.ach), atrioventricular conduction, and directly (in atrium) or indirectly (in ventricles) force of contraction. however, the functional response elicited by m-chr-activation depends on species, age, anatomic structure investigated, and m-chr-agonist concentration used. among the five m-chr-subtypes m(2)-chr is the predominant isoform present in the mammalian heart, while in the coronary circulation m(3)-chr have been identified. in addition, evidence for a possible existence of an additional, not m(2)-chr in the heart has been presented. m-chr are subject to regulation by g-protein-coupled-receptor kinase. alterations of cardiac m(2)-chr in age and various kinds of disease are discussed.
sequence and organization of the neodiprion lecontei nucleopolyhedrovirus genome the genome of the lymantria dispar multinucleocapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (ldmnpv) was sequenced and analyzed. it is composed of 161,046 bases with a g + c content of 57.5% and contains 163 putative open reading frames (orfs) of >/=150 nucleotides. homologs were found to 95 of the 155 genes predicted for the autographa californica mnpv (acmnpv) genome. more than 9% of the ldmnpv genome was occupied by 16 repeated genes related to acmnpv orf2. readily identifiable homologs of several genes that have been reported to play important roles in the acmnpv life cycle are not present; these include ie-2, a transcriptional transactivator, and gp64, a major envelope glycoprotein of the nonoccluded form of the virus. a number of genes lacking in acmnpv but present in other baculoviruses were identified; these include two viral enhancing factor homologs, a second copy of a conotoxin-like gene, and a dutpase homolog. although a single gene predicted to encode a large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase was found, two different copies of the small subunit gene were present. in addition, homologs of genes not previously reported for baculoviruses were identified, including a predicted protein with homology to dna ligases and another that has motifs most closely related to a yeast mitochondrial helicase. thirteen homologous regions (hrs) containing 54 repeated sequences that include 30-bp imperfect palindromes were identified. the imperfect palindromes are related to those from other baculoviruses.
a novel feeder-free system for human embryonic stem cells and characterization of their sublines with autogenic and allogenic cultivation human pluripotent stem cells hold promising potential in many therapeutics applications including regenerative medicine and drug discovery. over the past three decades, embryonic stem cell research has illustrated that embryonic stem cells possess two important and distinct properties: the ability to continuously self-renew and the ability to differentiate into all specialized cell types. in this article, we will discuss the continuing evolution of human pluripotent stem cell culture by examining requirements needed for the maintenance of self-renewal in vitro. we will also elaborate on the future direction of the field toward generating a robust and completely defined culture system, which has brought forth collaborations amongst biologists and engineers. as human pluripotent stem cell research progresses towards identifying solutions for debilitating diseases, it will be critical to establish a defined, reproducible and scalable culture system to meet the requirements of these clinical applications.
visual acuity versus letter contrast sensitivity in early cataract does the color of text influence its legibility? there are reasons why it may do so for specific groups of low-vision observers. we used psychophysical methods to measure the effects of wavelength on the reading performance of four normal observers, two dichromats, and twenty-five low-vision observers. reading rates were measured for text scanned across the face of a television (tv) monitor. we compared performance under four luminance-matched conditions in which sets of neutral-density and wratten color filters were placed in front of the tv screen--blue (lambda max = 430 nm), green (lambda max = 550 nm), red (lambda max = 650 nm), and gray. under photopic conditions, the reading rates of normal subjects were independent of wavelength, with the exception of characters near the acuity limit. at lower luminances, wavelength effects could be explained by the shift from photopic to scotopic vision. it was hypothesized that light scatter or absorption in eyes with cloudy ocular media would result in depressed performance in the blue. only one of seven subjects demonstrated this effect, which we traced to wavelength-specific absorption. observers with advanced photoreceptor disorders tended to read blue text faster than red text. this could not be explained on the basis of photopic spectral sensitivities alone. finally, the presence of central or peripheral field loss was not predictive of wavelength-specific effects in reading. on the whole, wavelength only occasionally plays a significant role in reading. when it does, performance tends to be depressed either in the red or the blue and to be nearly optimal for green or gray.
evidence that fibroblasts derive from epithelium during tissue fibrosis. progressive tissue fibrosis can compromise epithelial function resulting in organ failure. appreciating evidence suggests that fibroblasts provide fibrogenic collagens during such injury. we further tested this notion by attempting to reduce the physiologic consequences of organ fibrosis through the selective killing of fibroblasts at sites of injury. here, we report the conditional reduction of tissue fibroblasts using the coding sequence for herpesvirus thymidine kinase (deltatk) put under the control of a cell-specific promoter from the gene encoding fibroblast-specific protein 1 (fsp1). transgenic fibroblasts from mice carrying fsp1.deltatk minigenes expressed thymidine kinase concordantly with native fsp1 and, compared to transgenic epithelium, were selectively susceptible to the lethal effects of nucleoside analogs either in culture or during experimental renal fibrosis. the numbers of fibroblasts in fibrogenic kidney tissue were reduced on exposure to nucleoside analogs as was the degree of type i collagen deposition and the extent of fibrosis. fibroblast reduction following the stress of dna chain termination highlights the important contribution of cell division during fibrogenesis. our findings convey a proof of principle regarding the importance of fsp1(+) fibroblasts in fibrosis as well as providing a new approach to treating the relentless scarification of tissue.
verification of tokyo guidelines for diagnosis and management of acute cholangitis emergency surgery for patients with severe acute cholangitis carries formidable postoperative morbidity and mortality rates. a retrospective study was conducted on 86 consecutive patients who had exploration for the calculous obstructions to identify the high-risk population to guide better management. septicemic shock was present in 55 patients before surgery. all patients had ductal exploration under general anesthesia. additional procedures included cholecystectomy (n = 55), cholecystostomy (n = 5), and transhepatic intubation (n = 2). complications and deaths occurred in 43 (50%) and 17 (20%) patients, respectively. multivariate analysis on the 25 clinical (n = 14) and biochemical (n = 11) parameters evaluated yield the following five predictive factors (relative risk): the presence of concomitant medical problems (4.5); ph less than 7.4 (3.5); total bilirubin more than 90 mumol/l (3.1); platelet less than 150 x 10(9)/l (2.9), and serum albumin less than 30 g/l (2.9). in the presence of three or more albumin less than 30 g/l (2.9). in the presence of three or more risk factors, postoperative morbidity and mortality rates were 91% and 55%, respectively, which were significantly higher than those with two or less risk factors (34% and 6%, respectively). as thrombocytopenia developed even with transient hypotension, timely ductal decompression would improve outcome of these patients after surgery. for the high-risk population, application of nonoperative biliary drainage might be considered.
maternal exposure to nitrogen dioxide during pregnancy and offspring birth weight: comparison of two exposure models background evidence suggests that air pollution exposure adversely affects pregnancy outcomes. few studies have examined individual-level intraurban exposure contrasts. objectives we evaluated the impacts of air pollution on small for gestational age (sga) birth weight, low full-term birth weight (lbw), and preterm birth using spatiotemporal exposure metrics. methods with linked administrative data, we identified 70,249 singleton births (1999–2002) with complete covariate data (sex, ethnicity, parity, birth month and year, income, education) and maternal residential history in vancouver, british columbia, canada. we estimated residential exposures by month of pregnancy using nearest and inverse-distance weighting (idw) of study area monitors [carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, nitric oxide, ozone, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter < 2.5 (pm2.5) or < 10 (pm10) μm in aerodynamic diameter], temporally adjusted land use regression (lur) models (no, no2, pm2.5, black carbon), and proximity to major roads. using logistic regression, we estimated the risk of mean (entire pregnancy, first and last month of pregnancy, first and last 3 months) air pollution concentrations on sga (< 10th percentile), term lbw (< 2,500 g), and preterm birth. results residence within 50 m of highways was associated with a 26% increase in sga [95% confidence interval (ci), 1.07–1.49] and an 11% (95% ci, 1.01–1.23) increase in lbw. exposure to all air pollutants except o3 was associated with sga, with similar odds ratios (ors) for lur and monitoring estimates (e.g., lur: or = 1.02; 95% ci, 1.00–1.04; idw: or = 1.05; 95% ci, 1.03–1.08 per 10-μg/m3 increase in no). for preterm births, associations were observed with pm2.5 for births < 37 weeks gestation (and for other pollutants at < 30 weeks). no consistent patterns suggested exposure windows of greater relevance. conclusion associations between traffic-related air pollution and birth outcomes were observed in a population-based cohort with relatively low ambient air pollution exposure.
the tgfβ pathway is a key player for the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition in the embryonic aorta. haematopoietic stem cells (hscs) are the founder cells of the adult haematopoietic system, and thus knowledge of the molecular program directing their generation during development is important for regenerative haematopoietic strategies. runx1 is a pivotal transcription factor required for hsc generation in the vascular regions of the mouse conceptus—the aorta, vitelline and umbilical arteries, yolk sac and placenta. it is thought that hscs emerge from vascular endothelial cells through the formation of intra-arterial clusters and that runx1 functions during the transition from ‘haemogenic endothelium’ to hscs. here we show by conditional deletion that runx1 activity in vascular-endothelial-cadherin-positive endothelial cells is indeed essential for intra-arterial cluster, haematopoietic progenitor and hsc formation in mice. in contrast, runx1 is not required in cells expressing vav1, one of the first pan-haematopoietic genes expressed in hscs. collectively these data show that runx1 function is essential in endothelial cells for haematopoietic progenitor and hsc formation from the vasculature, but its requirement ends once or before vav is expressed.
neuronal network analysis axons in the cerebral cortex receive synaptic input at the axon initial segment almost exclusively from γ-aminobutyric acid–releasing (gabaergic) axo-axonic cells (aacs). the axon has the lowest threshold for action potential generation in neurons; thus, aacs are considered to be strategically placed inhibitory neurons controlling neuronal output. however, we found that aacs can depolarize pyramidal cells and can initiate stereotyped series of synaptic events in rat and human cortical networks because of a depolarized reversal potential for axonal relative to perisomatic gabaergic inputs. excitation and signal propagation initiated by aacs is supported by the absence of the potassium chloride cotransporter 2 in the axon.
influence of magnetic field strength and image registration strategy on voxel‐based morphometry in a study of alzheimer's disease structural imaging based on magnetic resonance is an integral part of the clinical assessment of patients with suspected alzheimer dementia. prospective data on the natural history of change in structural markers from preclinical to overt stages of alzheimer disease are radically changing how the disease is conceptualized, and will influence its future diagnosis and treatment. atrophy of medial temporal structures is now considered to be a valid diagnostic marker at the mild cognitive impairment stage. structural imaging is also included in diagnostic criteria for the most prevalent non-alzheimer dementias, reflecting its value in differential diagnosis. in addition, rates of whole-brain and hippocampal atrophy are sensitive markers of neurodegeneration, and are increasingly used as outcome measures in trials of potentially disease-modifying therapies. large multicenter studies are currently investigating the value of other imaging and nonimaging markers as adjuncts to clinical assessment in diagnosis and monitoring of progression. the utility of structural imaging and other markers will be increased by standardization of acquisition and analysis methods, and by development of robust algorithms for automated assessment.
monocular core zones and binocular border strips in primate striate cortex revealed by the contrasting effects of enucleation, eyelid suture, and retinal laser lesions on cytochrome oxidase activity monkey models were used to examine the effects of competition for cortical territory between two eyes which were deprived simultaneously, but each eye experienced a different type of deprivation. we wanted to determine whether, under this condition of binocular unequal deprivation, the postnatal process of segregation into ocular dominance columns proceeds according to the same rules as those that apply to competition between a deprived and an undeprived fellow eye. our models involved surgical removal of the natural lens from one eye in newborn rhesus monkeys. the resulting aphakia was corrected optically to a near point with extended‐wear contact lenses. the fellow eyes were either left unmanipulated or occluded with opaque contact lenses for varying periods during the day. at the end of the rearing period, some monkeys from each experimental group had either one eye enucleated or sustained injury to the retinal ganglion cells of one eye. the histochemical reaction for cytochrome oxidase was used to reveal the widths of ocular dominance columns in layer 4c of striate cortex in these monkeys. under all experimental conditions, the axons related to the two eyes occupied segregated fields. the amount of cortical territory related to the aphakic, optically corrected eye depended on the manipulations of the fellow eye. in competition with an unmanipulated fellow eye, the aphakic eye's territory was greatly reduced. in competition with a part‐time occluded eye, its territory was reduced to a lesser degree, depending on the duration of the occlusion. in competition with a continuously occluded eye, however, the space related to the aphakic, optically corrected eye was slightly greater than that related to the occluded eye. since neither the aphakic nor the continuously occluded eye receives normal visual input, they are both impaired. therefore, they may compete on an almost equal basis for synaptic territory in layer 4c of striate cortex. moreover, it is likely that activities originating in the aphakic and the continuously occluded eye are asynchronous, and that this condition is sufficient to drive the postnatal segregation of inputs from the two deprived eyes.
atp hydrolysis provides functions that promote rejection of pairings between different copies of long repeated sequences ideally, self-assembly should rapidly and efficiently produce stable correctly assembled structures. we study the tradeoff between enthalpic and entropic cost in self-assembling systems using reca-mediated homology search as an example. earlier work suggested that reca searches could produce stable final structures with high stringency using a slow testing process that follows an initial rapid search of ∼9-15 bases. in this work, we will show that as a result of entropic and enthalpic barriers, simultaneously testing all ∼9-15 bases as separate individual units results in a longer overall searching time than testing them in groups and stages.
validity of verbal autopsy method to determine causes of death among adults in the urban setting of ethiopia objective  to determine the level of hiv‐related mortality reduction after the introduction of large‐scale antiretroviral therapy (art) using a burial surveillance system coupled with verbal autopsy (va) in addis ababa, ethiopia.
closed-form solutions for options in incomplete markets february , 2013 in this paper we study both market risks and nonmarket risks, without complete markets assumption, and discuss methods of measurement of these risks. we present and justify a set of four desirable properties for measures of risk, and call the measures satisfying these properties "coherent." we examine the measures of risk provided and the related actions required by span, by the sec/nasd rules, and by quantile-based methods. we demonstrate the universality of scenario-based methods for providing coherent measures. we offer suggestions concerning the sec method. we also suggest a method to repair the failure of subadditivity of quantile-based methods. copyright blackwell publishers inc 1999.
influence of biofuel crops on mosquito production and oviposition site selection biofuels are a new priority in efforts to reduce dependence on fossil fuels; nevertheless, the rapid increase in production of biofuel feedstock may threaten biodiversity. there are general principles that should be used in developing guidelines for certifying biodiversity-friendly biofuels. first, biofuel feedstocks should be grown with environmentally safe and biodiversity-friendly agricultural practices. the sustainability of any biofuel feedstock depends on good growing practices and sound environmental practices throughout the fuel-production life cycle. second, the ecological footprint of a biofuel, in terms of the land area needed to grow sufficient quantities of the feedstock, should be minimized. the best alternatives appear to be fuels of the future, especially fuels derived from microalgae. third, biofuels that can sequester carbon or that have a negative or zero carbon balance when viewed over the entire production life cycle should be given high priority. corn-based ethanol is the worst among the alternatives that are available at present, although this is the biofuel that is most advanced for commercial production in the united states. we urge aggressive pursuit of alternatives to corn as a biofuel feedstock. conservation biologists can significantly broaden and deepen efforts to develop sustainable fuels by playing active roles in pursuing research on biodiversity-friendly biofuel production practices and by helping define biodiversity-friendly biofuel certification standards.
all-cause mortality of high-normal random blood glucose using basic demographics background diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose metabolism are associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease (cvd). however, it is still not clear whether glucose levels can predict cvd risk among patients without diabetes. the primary aim of this study is to assess whether normoglycemic fasting plasma glucose (fpg) is associated with increased risk of cvd outcomes in healthy patients.   methods we obtained blood measurements, data from physical examination, and medical and lifestyle information from 10,913 men and women who were evaluated in the institute for preventive medicine of sheba medical center. enrolled were participants with fpg <100 mg/dl as well as 100 to 125 mg/dl, who were free of diagnosis of cvd. the participants were actively screened for coronary disease using a stress test. primary end points were coronary heart disease or self-reported cerebral vascular disease.   results a total of 1,119 incident cases of cvd occurred during a mean follow-up of 4.3 years. subjects with fasting glucose levels in the high normal range (95-99 mg/dl) had an increased cvd risk when compared with levels <80 mg/dl, (hr 1.53;ci 95% [1.22-1.91], p < .001). a multivariate model, adjusted for age, sex, family history of cvd, blood pressure, body mass index, smoking status, pharmacologic treatment, serum triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, revealed an independent increased risk of cvd with rising fpg levels in the normal range.   conclusion elevated cvd risk is strongly and independently associated with glucose levels within the normoglycemic range. fasting plasma glucose may help in identifying apparently healthy persons with early metabolic abnormalities who are at increased risk for cvd before progression to prediabetes and overt diabetes mellitus.
risk of cardiovascular events from current, recent, and cumulative exposure to abacavir among persons living with hiv who were receiving antiretroviral therapy in the united states: a cohort study context metabolic changes and smoking are common among hiv patients and may confer increased cardiovascular risk.   objective the aim of the study was to determine acute myocardial infarction (ami) rates and cardiovascular risk factors in hiv compared with non-hiv patients in two tertiary care hospitals.   design, setting, and participants we conducted a health care system-based cohort study using a large data registry with 3,851 hiv and 1,044,589 non-hiv patients. ami rates were determined among patients receiving longitudinal care between october 1, 1996, and june 30, 2004.   main outcome measures the primary outcome was myocardial infarction, identified by international classification of diseases coding criteria.   results ami was identified in 189 hiv and 26,142 non-hiv patients. ami rates per 1000 person-years were increased in hiv vs. non-hiv patients [11.13 (95% confidence interval [ci] 9.58-12.68) vs. 6.98 (95% ci 6.89-7.06)]. the hiv cohort had significantly higher proportions of hypertension (21.2 vs. 15.9%), diabetes (11.5 vs. 6.6%), and dyslipidemia (23.3 vs. 17.6%) than the non-hiv cohort (p < 0.0001 for each comparison). the difference in ami rates between hiv and non-hiv patients was significant, with a relative risk (rr) of 1.75 (95% ci 1.51-2.02; p < 0.0001), adjusting for age, gender, race, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. in gender-stratified models, the unadjusted ami rates per 1000 person-years were higher for hiv patients among women (12.71 vs. 4.88 for hiv compared with non-hiv women), but not among men (10.48 vs. 11.44 for hiv compared with non-hiv men). the rrs (for hiv vs. non-hiv) were 2.98 (95% ci 2.33-3.75; p < 0.0001) for women and 1.40 (95% ci 1.16-1.67; p = 0.0003) for men, adjusting for age, gender, race, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. a limitation of this database is that it contains incomplete data on smoking. smoking could not be included in the overall regression model, and some of the increased risk may be accounted for by differences in smoking rates.   conclusions ami rates and cardiovascular risk factors were increased in hiv compared with non-hiv patients, particularly among women. cardiac risk modification strategies are important for the long-term care of hiv patients.
neighborhood context and birth outcomes: going beyond neighborhood disadvantage, incorporating affluence over the last several decades, epidemiological studies have been enormously successful in identifying risk factors for major diseases. however, most of this research has focused attention on risk factors that are relatively proximal causes of disease such as diet, cholesterol level, exercise and the like. we question the emphasis on such individually-based risk factors and argue that greater attention must be paid to basic social conditions if health reform is to have its maximum effect in the time ahead. there are two reasons for this claim. first we argue that individually-based risk factors must be contextualized, by examining what puts people at risk of risks, if we are to craft effective interventions and improve the nation's health. second, we argue that social factors such as socioeconomic status and social support are likely "fundamental causes" of disease that, because they embody access to important resources, affect multiple disease outcomes through multiple mechanisms, and consequently maintain an association with disease even when intervening mechanisms change. without careful attention to these possibilities, we run the risk of imposing individually-based intervention strategies that are ineffective and of missing opportunities to adopt broad-based societal interventions that could produce substantial health benefits for our citizens.
the relevance of applying exercise training principles when designing therapeutic interventions for patients with inflammatory myopathies: a systematic review the cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions is the official document that describes in detail the process of preparing and maintaining cochrane systematic reviews on the effects of healthcare interventions.
universal dependency analysis in many real-world applications, data is collected in multi-dimensional spaces. however, not all dimensions are relevant for data analysis. instead, interesting knowledge is hidden in correlated subsets of dimensions (i.e., subspaces of the original space). detecting these correlated subspaces independent of the underlying mining task is an open research problem. it is challenging due to the exponential search space. existing methods have tried to tackle this by utilizing apriori search schemes. however, they show poor scalability and miss high quality subspaces. this paper features a scalable subspace search scheme (4s), which overcomes the efficiency problem by departing from the traditional levelwise search. we propose a new generalized notion of correlated subspaces which gives way to transforming the search space to a correlation graph of dimensions. then we perform a direct mining of correlated subspaces in the graph. finally, we merge subspaces based on the mdl principle and obtain high dimensional subspaces with minimal redundancy. we theoretically show that our search scheme is more general than existing search schemes and has a significantly lower runtime complexity. our experiments reveal that 4s scales near-linearly with both database size and dimensionality, and produces higher quality subspaces than state-of-the-art methods.
mobile multispectral video streaming hyperspectral imaging has tremendous potential to detect important molecular biomarkers of early cancer based on their unique spectral signatures. several drawbacks have limited its use for in vivo screening applications: most notably the poor temporal and spatial resolution, high expense, and low optical throughput of existing hyperspectral imagers. we present the development of a new real-time hyperspectral endoscope (called the image mapping spectroscopy endoscope) based on an image mapping technique capable of addressing these challenges. the parallel high throughput nature of this technique enables the device to operate at frame rates of 5.2 frames per second while collecting a (x, y, λ) datacube of 350 × 350 × 48. we have successfully imaged tissue in vivo, resolving a vasculature pattern of the lower lip while simultaneously detecting oxy-hemoglobin.
genetic screen of african americans with fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy objective to review 30 years' clinical experience with fuchs corneal endothelial dystrophy leading to penetrating keratoplasty (pk).   methods we reviewed the clinical records of patients diagnosed histopathologically as having fuchs corneal endothelial dystrophy who underwent pk at duke university medical center between january 1, 1972, and december 31, 2001. this observational case series included 424 patients (546 eyes).   results women represented 77.6% of patients. mean age at the time of pk for all patients was 69.2 years. bilateral pk was required in 28.8% of patients, and the mean interval between the 2 pks was 3.2 years. there was no difference with regard to sex in the likelihood of requiring bilateral pk (p=.59). among 376 documented family histories, 13.6% were known to be positive for fuchs dystrophy. patients with a positive family history underwent pk a mean of 5 years earlier (p<.002) and were more likely to require bilateral pk (p<.003). patients who underwent bilateral pk were twice as likely to have a positive family history compared with those undergoing unilateral pk (p<.001). mean visual acuities at corneal thicknesses of 539 to 650 microm, 651 to 750 microm, and greater than 750 microm were 20/60, 20/60, and 20/80, respectively. patients who underwent bilateral pk and had a preceding cataract extraction on 1 eye required pk of the pseudophakic eye on average 3.2 years earlier than the fellow eye. the mean time from cataract extraction to pk was 2.2 years.   conclusions this large study affirms that fuchs dystrophy is a disorder of aging that predominantly affects women (3.5:1) and is often familial. pachymetry-determined corneal thickness was a poor predictor of visual acuity until extreme levels of corneal edema were reached. cataract extraction in an eye with fuchs dystrophy leads to earlier pk.
mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from reed canary grass in paludiculture: effect of groundwater level northern peatland methane (ch4) budgets are important for global ch4 emissions. this study aims to determine the ecosystem ch4 budget and specifically to quantify the importance of phalaris arundinacea by using different chamber techniques in a temperate wetland. annually, roughly 70 ± 35% of ecosystem ch4 emissions were plant-mediated, but data show no evidence of significant diurnal variations related to convective gas flow regardless of season or plant growth stages. therefore, despite a high percentage of arenchyma, p. arundinacea-mediated ch4 transport is interpreted to be predominantly passive. thus, diurnal variations are less important in contrast to wetland vascular plants facilitating convective gas flow. despite of plant-dominant ch4 transport, net ch4 fluxes were low (– 0.005–0.016 μmol m−2 s−1) and annually less than 1% of the annual c-co2 assimilation. this is considered a result of an effective root zone oxygenation resulting in increased ch4 oxidation in the rhizosphere at high water levels. this study shows that although ch4, having a global warming potential 25 times greater than co2, is emitted from this p. arundinacea wetland, less than 9% of the c sequestered counterbalances the ch4 emissions to the atmosphere. it is concluded that p. arundinacea-dominant wetlands are an attractive c-sequestration ecosystem.
finite element modeling of short-wavelength folding on venus: implications for the plume hypothesis for crustal plateau formation crustal plateaus on venus constitute one of that planet’s most intriguing tectonic features. they host so-called “tessera” terrain, or deformed crust exhibiting two or more sets of intersecting tectonic lineaments, which comprises»8% of venus’ surface. major questions surrounding crustal plateaus and tessera terrain include: (1) what is the nature of crustal plateau deformation? what structures are present, and what are their spatial and temporal relations? (2) what is the global distribution of tessera terrain? does it form a global layer under the regional plains, cropping out in crustal plateaus, or is it confined to crustal plateaus? and (3) what are the implications of (1) and (2) for understanding the processes responsible for formation and deformation of crustal plateaus? structural and kinematic analyses reveal that deformation at ovda regio, venus largest crustal plateau, is characterized by linear shallow steep-sided troughs (ribbons), long arcuate long-wavelength folds, short mid-wavelength folds, and wide complex graben. temporal relations between structures lead to a three-phase regional strain history consisting of (1) layer-normal flattening of a thin competent membrane resulting in radially oriented, distributed extension (ribbon formation); (2) modest contraction of a thicker layer (concentric folding at plateau margins, interference folding in the plateau interior); and (3) limited extension localized at fold crests (graben formation). wavelength analysis of ribbons and folds places limits on the thickness of the competent layer during each stage of deformation and reflects an early shallow brittle‐ductile transition (bdt) that deepened with time. ovda’s deformation, topography, and gravity are all spatially correlated, strongly suggesting a genetic relationship between surface deformation and processes causing crustal thickening and plateau uplift. thus tessera terrain at ovda regio is likely confined to the topographically high plateau and does not extend beneath the surrounding regional plains. similar patterns persist at other crustal plateaus, indicating that tessera terrain is in general confined to crustal plateaus and does not form a globally continuous layer. ovda’s structures, their spatial and temporal relations, the resulting strain history, and the behavior of the bdt through time support a model of mantle plume upwelling in a thin lithospheric regime for crustal plateau formation and contradict previous downwelling models. similarities between structural and kinematic trends at ovda regio and other crustal plateaus lend support to this idea. c ∞ 1999 academic press
acute lymphoblastic leukemia in early childhood as the presenting sign of ataxia-telangiectasia variant ataxia-telangiectasia (a-t) is a syndrome that has an extremely high incidence of cancer. patients with the disease are homozygous for a mutant gene, the a-t gene, located at 11q23. of these individuals, 30-40% develop cancer. of these cancers, 80% are lymphoid. those heterozygous for the a-t gene also have an increased frequency of cancer, the most notable being the 6.8-fold increase of breast cancer in females carriers. the syndrome is characterized cytogenetically by increased nonrandom chromosome breaks and rearrangements in lymphocytes involving the sites of the immunoglobulin and t-cell receptor genes. clones of cells having the same rearrangements are often present in the blood of the a-t patients and if the rearrangements involve certain sites, especially a locus within 14q32, the propensity to progress to a malignant transformation is great. sequencing the a-t gene and ascertaining its function should contribute significantly to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer susceptibility.
a interaction with the cxcr 4 third intracellular loop regulates endocytosis and signaling of wt and whim-like receptors chemotaxis mediated by chemokine receptors such as cxcr4 plays a key role in lymphocyte homing and hematopoiesis as well as in breast cancer metastasis. we have demonstrated previously that β-arrestin2 functions to attenuate cxcr4-mediated g protein activation and to enhance cxcr4 internalization. here we show further that the expression of β-arrestin2 in both hela and human embryonic kidney 293 cells significantly enhances the chemotactic efficacy of stromal cell-derived factor 1α, the specific agonist of cxcr4, whereas the suppression of β-arrestin2 endogenous expression by antisense or rna-mediated interference technology considerably attenuates stromal cell-derived factor 1α-induced cell migration. expression of β-arrestin2 also augmented chemokine receptor ccr5-mediated but not epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated chemotaxis, indicating the specific effect of β-arrestin2. further analysis reveals that expression of β-arrestin2 strengthened cxcr4-mediated activation of both p38 mapk and erk, and the suppression of β-arrestin2 expression blocked the activation of two kinases. interestingly, inhibition of p38 mapk activation (but not erk activation) by its inhibitors or by expression of a dominant-negative mutant of p38 mapk effectively blocked the chemotactic effect of β-arrestin2. expression of a dominant-negative mutant of ask1 also exerted the similar blocking effect. the results of our study suggest that β-arrestin2 can function not only as a regulator of cxcr4 signaling but also as a mediator of stromal cell-derived factor 1α-induced chemotaxis and that this activity probably occurs via the ask1/p38 mapk pathway.
intraoperative assessment of biliary anatomy for prevention of bile duct injury: a review of current and future patient safety interventions f t i m k c 8 nlike blood vessels, the biliary tract lies in the glissonian heath and is buried in the perivascular connective tissue, o it is difficult to clearly visualize and isolate it during epatobiliary surgery. intraoperative cholangiography ioc), which was originally introduced by mirizzi in 937, has been widely used to delineate the biliary tract natomy in this setting. for example, routine ioc was ecently recommended during cholecystectomy to prevent ile duct injury. ioc is also considered an essential proedure during donor hepatectomy because it enables the ile duct to be divided at the appropriate level to ensure ider and fewer residual orifices. but conventional raiographic ioc is disadvantageous in that it exposes the atient and the medical staff to radiation and usually reuires a large and expensive c-arm fluoroscopy machine nd the additional human resources involved. recently, intraoperative angiography using a fluorescent maging technique with iv injection of indocyanine green icg) has been used to assess coronary artery bypass graft atency. this technique is based on the principle that cg binds to plasma proteins and that protein-bound icg mits light with a peak wavelength of about 830 nm when lluminated with near-infrared light. because human ile also contains plasma proteins that bind with icg, we ypothesized that fluorescent images of the biliary tract ould be obtained with intrabiliary injection of icg. we lso hypothesized that iv injection of icg would provide luorescent images of the biliary tract without necessitating
beyond mobile telephony : exploring opportunities for applications on the mobile phone handset skimming or browsing audio recordings is much more difficult than visually scanning a document because of the temporal nature of audio. by exploiting properties of spontaneous speech it is possible to automatically select and present salient audio segments in a time-efficient manner. techniques for segmenting recordings and a prototype user interface for skimming speech are described. the system developed incorporates time-compressed speech and pause removal to reduce the time needed to listen to speech recordings. this paper presents a multi-level approach to auditory skimming, along with user interface techniques for interacting with the audio and providing feedback. several time compression algorithms ami an adaptive speech detection technique are also stuntnarized.
self-care strategies for emotional distress among young adults in catalonia: a qualitative study despite the high prevalence of mental health problems and disorders that develop in adolescence and early adulthood, young people tend to not seek professional help. young men and young people from indigenous and ethnic minority groups tend to be those most reluctant to seek help. young people are more inclined to seek help for mental health problems if they: have some knowledge about mental health issues and sources of help; feel emotionally competent to express their feelings; and have established and trusted relationships with potential help providers. young people are less likely to seek help if they: are experiencing suicidal thoughts and depressive symptoms; hold negative attitudes toward seeking help or have had negative past experiences with sources of help; or hold beliefs that they should be able to sort out their own mental health problems on their own. young people may seek help through talking to their family and friends, with family being more important for younger adolescents, and friends and partners becoming more influential later on. the professionals most likely to act as gatekeepers to mental health services for young people are school counsellors, general practitioners, and youth workers. increasingly, internet‐based information and interventions are being used to engage young people in the help‐seeking process.
working overtime: patterns of smartphone and pc usage in the day of an information worker the number of computing devices that people use is growing. to gain a better understanding of why and how people use multiple devices, we interviewed 27 people from academia and industry. from these interviews we distill four primary findings. first, associating a user's activities with a particular device is problematic for multiple device users because many activities span multiple devices. second, device use varies by user and circumstance; users assign different roles to devices both by choice and by constraint. third, users in industry want to separate work and personal activities across work and personal devices, but they have difficulty doing so in practice finally, users employ a variety of techniques for accessing information across devices, but there is room for improvement: participants reported managing information across their devices as the most challenging aspect of using multiple devices. we suggest opportunities to improve the user experience by focusing on the user rather than the applications and devices; making devices aware of their roles; and providing lighter-weight methods for transferring information, including synchronization services that engender more trust from users.
cd4+cd62l+ central memory t cells can be converted to foxp3+ t cells cd4+ cd25+ regulatory t cells prevent organ‐specific autoimmune diseases in various animal models. we analysed human lymphoid tissues to identify similar cd25+ regulatory t cells. adult peripheral blood contained two populations of cd4+ t cells that expressed cd25 at different densities. the larger population (≈ 40%) expressed intermediate levels of cd25 (cd25+) and displayed a memory t‐cell phenotype (cd45ra−/ro+, cd45rblow, cd95+, cd62llow, cd38low). the smaller population of cells (≈ 2%) expressed very high levels of cd25 (cd25++). in addition to the activation/memory t‐cell antigens mentioned above they also expressed intracellular cd152 (ctla‐4) as well as enhanced levels of cell‐surface cd122, similar to the murine cd4+ cd25+ regulatory counterpart. to exclude that the cd25++ cells had not been recently primed by external antigen we analysed cord blood and thymus. cd25++, cd152+ and cd122++ cells were present in paediatric thymus (10% of cd4+ cd8− thymocytes) expressing signs of recent selection (cd69+) and in cord blood (5% of cd4+ cells) where they showed a naive phenotype. in addition, cord blood contained a small population of cd25+ cells (≈ 2% of cd4 t cells) that were cd152− and cd122low and displayed signs of activation. together with published data that cd25+ cd25++ cells from the thymus and peripheral blood are regulatory, our results suggest that regulatory cd25+ t cells leave the thymus in a naïve state and become activated in the periphery.

modulation of gene expression in actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae exposed to bronchoalveolar fluid abstract mycobacterium bovis bcg, the only presently available vaccine against tuberculosis, was obtained from virulent m. bovis after serial passages in vitro. the vaccine strain retained at least some of its original virulence, as it persists in immune-competent hosts and occasionally may cause fatal disease in immune-deficient hosts. mycobacterial persistence in vivo is thought to depend on anaerobic metabolism, an apparent paradox since all mycobacteria are obligate aerobes. here we report that m. bovis bcg lacking anaerobic nitrate reductase (narghji), an enzyme essential for nitrate respiration, failed to persist in the lungs, liver, and kidneys of immune-competent (balb/c) mice. in immune-deficient (scid) mice, however, bacilli caused chronic infection despite disruption of narg, even if growth of the mutant was severely impaired in lungs, liver, and kidneys. persistence and growth of bcg in the spleens of either mouse strain appeared largely unaffected by lack of anaerobic nitrate reductase, indicating that the role of the enzyme in pathogenesis is tissue specific. these data suggest first that anaerobic nitrate reduction is essential for metabolism of m. bovis bcg in immune-competent but not immune-deficient mice and second that its role in mycobacterial disease is tissue specific, both of which are observations with important implications for pathogenesis of mycobacteria and vaccine development.
light-dependent decomposition of ficz, an endogenous ligand of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor the physiological role of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (ahr), a member of the basic helix-loop-helix per-arnt-sim (pas) transcription factor family is not known. we have suggested that the ahr is involved in light signaling through binding of photoproducts with high ahr affinity. this suggestion is based on (i) the high ahr affinity of the tryptophan photoproduct formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (ficz), (ii) the induction of rapid and transient expression of ahr-regulated genes by ficz and by extracts of uv-irradiated tryptophan as well as (iii) the fact that light induces the ahr-regulated cytochrome p450s cyp1a1, cyp1b1 and cyp2s1. the transient mrna expression caused by light and tryptophan photoproducts suggests that the biotransformation enzymes induced by ahr activation take part in a metabolic degradation of the natural ahr ligand. this study aimed at identifying the involvement of phase i and phase ii enzymes in the metabolic degradation of ficz. a cytochrome p450-dependent metabolism of ficz giving rise to preferentially mono- and di-hydroxylated derivatives has earlier been reported. in the present study, rat and human hepatic s9 mixes were employed together with specific enzyme inhibitors and cofactors. compared to the aroclor-induced rat liver s9, the non-induced rat liver s9 and the human liver s9 caused a more complex metabolite profile of ficz. the cyp1a1 enzyme was confirmed to be the most important enzyme for the first step in the metabolism. cyp1a2 was found to have overlapping specificity with cyp1a1 being able to form the same major metabolites although with different kinetics. cyp1b1 turned out to be preferentially involved in the further metabolism of dihydroxylated metabolites. microsomal epoxide hydrolase, and as yet not identified forms of sulphotransferases and glucuronosyltransferases were also found to take part in the metabolic degradation of ficz. thus, tryptophan photoproducts fit into a model in which the ligand-activated ahr signaling is autoregulated by the induced metabolic enzymes.
rapid development of adaptive, climate-driven clinal variation in seed mass in the invasive annual forb echium plantagineum l. biological invasions may expose populations to strong selection for local adaptation along geographical gradients in climate. however, evolution during contemporary timescales can be constrained by low standing genetic variation and genetic correlations among life-history traits. we examined limits to local adaptation associated with northern migration of the invasive wetland plant purple loosestrife (lythrum salicaria) using a selection model incorporating a trade-off between flowering time and size at reproduction, and common garden experiments of populations sampled along a latitudinal transect of approximately 1200 km in eastern north america. a strong trade-off between flowering time and size at reproduction caused early-flowering plants to be smaller with reduced seed production in northern populations. northward spread was associated with a decline in genetic variance within populations and an increase in genetic skew for flowering time and size, with limited genetic variation for small, early-flowering genotypes. these patterns were predicted by our selection model of local adaptation to shorter growing seasons and were not consistent with expectations from non-adaptive processes. reduced fecundity may limit population growth and rates of spread in northern populations. identifying genetic constraints on key life-history traits can provide novel insights into invasion dynamics and the causes of range limits in introduced species.
expression of the urease gene of agaricus bisporus: a tool for studying fruit body formation and post-harvest development abstract urease catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to ammonia and carbamate and has been found to be an important pathogenic factor for certain bacteria. cryptococcus neoformans is a significant human pathogenic fungus that produces large amounts of urease; thus we wanted to investigate the importance of urease in the pathogenesis of cryptococcosis. we cloned and sequenced the genomic locus containing the single-copy c. neoformans urease gene (ure1) and used this to disrupt the native ure1in the serotype a strain h99. the ure1 mutant strains were found to have in vitro growth characteristics, phenoloxidase activity, and capsule size similar to those of the wild type. comparison of aure1 mutant with h99 after intracisternal inoculation into corticosteroid-treated rabbits revealed no significant differences in colony counts recovered from the cerebrospinal fluid. however, when these two strains were compared in both the murine intravenous and inhalational infection models, there were significant differences in survival. mice infected with a ure1 strain lived longer than mice infected with h99 in both models. the ure1 strain was restored to urease positivity by complementation withure1, and two resulting transformants were significantly more pathogenic than the ure1 strain. our results suggest that urease activity is involved in the pathogenesis of cryptococcosis but that the importance may be species and/or infection site specific.
effective attack models for shilling item-based collaborative filtering systems web usage mining has recently attracted attention as a viable framework for extracting useful access pattern information, such as user profiles, from massive amounts of web log data for the purpose of web site personalization and organization. these efforts have relied mainly on clustering or association rule discovery as the enabling data mining technologies. typically, data mining has to be completely re-applied periodically and offline on newly generated web server logs in order to keep the discovered knowledge up to date. in addition to difficulty to scale and adapt in the face of large data and continuously evolving patterns, most clustering techniques, such as the majority of kmeans variants, also suffer from one or more of the following limitations: requirement of the specification of the correct number of clusters/profiles in advance, sensitivity to initialization, sensitivity to the presence of noise and outliers in the data, and unsuitability for sparse data sets. hence, there is a crucial need for scalable, noise insensitive, initialization independent techniques that can continuously discover possibly evolving web user profiles without any stoppages or reconfigurations. in this paper, we propose a new scalable clustering methodology that gleams inspiration from the natural immune system to be able to continuously learn and adapt to new incoming patterns. the web server plays the role of the human body, and the incoming requests play the role of foreign antigens/bacteria/viruses that need to be detected by the proposed immune based clustering technique. hence, our clustering algorithm plays the role of the cognitive agent of an artificial immune system, whose goal is to continuously perform an intelligent organization of the incoming noisy data into clusters. our approach exhibits superior learning abilities, while at the same time, requiring modest memory and computational costs. like the natural immune system, the strongest advantage of immune based learning compared to current approaches is expected to be its ease of adaptation to the dynamic environment that characterizes several applications, particularly in mining data streams. we illustrate the ability of the proposed approach in mining user profiles from web clickstream data in a single pass under different usage trend sequencing scenarios.
costs and advance directives at the end of life: a case of the ‘coaching older adults and carers to have their preferences heard (coach)’ trial background: severe traumatic brain injury often leads to death from withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy, although prognosis is difficult to determine. methods: to evaluate variation in mortality following the withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy and hospital mortality in patients with critical illness and severe traumatic brain injury, we conducted a two-year multicentre retrospective cohort study in six canadian level-one trauma centres. the effect of centre on hospital mortality and withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy was evaluated using multivariable logistic regression adjusted for baseline patient-level covariates (sex, age, pupillary reactivity and score on the glasgow coma scale). results: we randomly selected 720 patients with traumatic brain injury for our study. the overall hospital mortality among these patients was 228/720 (31.7%, 95% confidence interval [ci] 28.4%–35.2%) and ranged from 10.8% to 44.2% across centres (χ2 test for overall difference, p < 0.001). most deaths (70.2% [160/228], 95% ci 63.9%–75.7%) were associated with withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy, ranging from 45.0% (18/40) to 86.8% (46/53) (χ2 test for overall difference, p < 0.001) across centres. adjusted odd ratios (ors) for the effect of centre on hospital mortality ranged from 0.61 to 1.55 (p < 0.001). the incidence of withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy varied by centre, with ors ranging from 0.42 to 2.40 (p = 0.001). about one half of deaths that occurred following the withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies happened within the first three days of care. interpretation: we observed significant variation in mortality across centres. this may be explained in part by regional variations in physician, family or community approaches to the withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy. considering the high proportion of early deaths associated with the withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy and the limited accuracy of current prognostic indicators, caution should be used regarding early withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy following severe traumatic brain injury.
the ecology of conception and pregnancy failure in wild baboons abstract we investigated the long-standing premise in behavioral ecology that the environment affects behavior and demography. we did this by evaluating the extent to which year-to-year variability in the behavioral ecology of a nonhuman primate population could be modeled from meteorological patterns. data on activity profiles and home range use for baboons (papio cynocephalus) in amboseli, kenya, were obtained over a 10-year period for three social groups: two completely wild-foraging ones, and a third that supplemented its diet with refuse from a nearby tourist lodge. the relationships across years among activity budgeting, travel distance, group size, and measures of temperature and rainfall patterns differed among the social groups. although meteorological variation generally correlated with behavioral variation in the completely wild-foraging groups, different weather variables and direction of relationships resulted for each group. in addition, different relationships among variables were found before and after home-range shifts. the food-enhanced group spent half as much time foraging as did the other groups and therefore could be used to evaluate the relative extent to which foraging time was a limiting factor for resting and social time. under their relaxed ecological conditions, the food-enhanced animals increased resting time much more than social time. these findings, combined with supplementary information on the population, lead us to suggest that baboons use a suite of interrelated responses to ecological variability that includes not only changes in activity budgets, but also home-range shifts, changes in the length of the active period, and changes in group size through fissions. moreover, our results imply that group differences as well as interpopulational and interspecific differences in behavioral ecology provide significant sources of variability. therefore, social groups rather than populations may be the appropriate unit of analysis for understanding the behavioral ecology of baboons and other highly social primates. the different patterns we observed among groups may have fitness consequences for the individuals in those groups and thereby affect population structure over time.
angiotensin stimulates tgf-beta1 and clusterin in the hydronephrotic neonatal rat kidney. chronic unilateral ureteral obstruction (uuo) in early development activates the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system and leads to profound renal vasoconstriction, renal growth arrest, and interstitial fibrosis. to investigate the response of the at1 and at2 subtypes of the angiotensin ii (ang ii) receptors to uuo, sprague-dawley rats underwent uuo or control sham operation in the first 48 h of life and were studied 1-28 days later. renal mrna for renin, at1 and at2 receptor, and receptor binding and distribution were determined. in contrast to controls, renin mrna increased from 14 to 28 days in the obstructed kidney. after ipsilateral uuo, at1 mrna was suppressed at 1 day, but had increased compared with controls at 28 days. at2 receptor mrna fell rapidly in all kidneys from 1 to 3 days of age, after which it remained undetectable. compared with the intact opposite kidney, at2 mrna was suppressed in the obstructed kidney 1 day after uuo. compared with controls, at1 and at2 receptor binding was decreased by ipsilateral uuo at 1 day, whereas at1 binding was increased at 28 days. renal ang ii content was increased in the obstructed compared with the intact opposite kidney 28 days after uuo. in view of the increase in renal renin and angiotensin ii production resulting from uuo, increased renal at1 mrna and receptor binding are likely to contribute to the vasoconstriction and interstitial fibrosis of the neonatal kidney after prolonged uuo.
significance of the 13c-caffeine breath test for patients with cirrhosis the properties of caffeine render it an ideal substrate for a quantitative test of liver function. the aim of this study was to determine whether the caffeine breath test (cbt) using orally administered 13c‐caffeine correlates reliably with plasma caffeine clearance and reflects varying degrees of liver dysfunction. the cbt was performed in 25 healthy controls; 20 subjects with noncirrhotic, chronic hepatitis b or c; and 20 subjects with cirrhosis. plasma caffeine clearance was assayed simultaneously with the cbt in a cohort of these subjects. over a broad range of caffeine clearances, the cbt exhibited a highly significant correlation with plasma clearance (r = 0.85, p < .001). cirrhotic patients were characterized by significantly reduced cbt values (1.15 ± 0.75 δ‰ mg−1) compared with controls (2.23 ± 0.76; p = .001) and hepatitic patients (1.83 ± 1.05; p = .04). there was a significant inverse relationship between the cbt and child‐pugh score (r = −.74, p = .002). the intraclass correlation coefficient between repeated cbts in 20 subjects with normal and cirrhotic livers was 0.89. although smoking was associated with an 86% to 141% increase in cbt in all groups, the cbt was able to distinguish control, hepatitic, and cirrhotic smokers (5.36 ± 0.82, 3.63 ± 1.21, and 2.14 ± 1.14, respectively, p = .001). multivariate analysis revealed that only smoking (p < .001) and disease state (p = .001) were significant predictors of the cbt. in conclusion, the 13c‐cbt represents a valid indicator of plasma caffeine clearance and correlates reproducibly with hepatic dysfunction.
recognizing rna structural motifs in ht-selex data for ribosomal protein s15 the 16s rrna‐binding ribosomal protein s15 is a key component in the assembly of the small ribosomal subunit in bacteria. we have shown that s15 from the extreme thermophile thermus thermophilus represses the translation of its own mrna in vitro, by interacting with the leader segment of its mrna. the s15 mrna‐binding site was characterized by footprinting experiments, deletion analysis and site‐directed mutagenesis. s15 binding triggers a conformational rearrangement of its mrna into a fold that mimics the conserved three‐way junction of the s15 rrna‐binding site. this conformational change masks the ribosome entry site, as demonstrated by direct competition between the ribosomal subunit and s15 for mrna binding. a comparison of the t.thermophilus and escherichia coli regulation systems reveals that the two regulatory mrna targets do not share any similarity and that the mechanisms of translational inhibition are different. our results highlight an astonishing plasticity of mrna in its ability to adapt to evolutionary constraints, that contrasts with the extreme conservation of the rrna‐binding site.
gregarious sexual segregation: the unusual social organization of the malagasy narrow-striped mongoose (mungotictis decemlineata) the diversity of extant carnivores provides valuable opportunities for comparative research to illuminate general patterns of mammalian social evolution. recent field studies on mongooses (herpestidae), in particular, have generated detailed behavioural and demographic data allowing tests of assumptions and predictions of theories of social evolution. the first studies of the social systems of their closest relatives, the malagasy eupleridae, also have been initiated. the literature on mongooses was last reviewed over 25 years ago. in this review, we summarise the current state of knowledge on the social organisation, mating systems and social structure (especially competition and cooperation) of the two mongoose families. our second aim is to evaluate the contributions of these studies to a better understanding of mammalian social evolution in general. based on published reports or anecdotal information, we can classify 16 of the 34 species of herpestidae as solitary and nine as group‐living; there are insufficient data available for the remainder. there is a strong phylogenetic signal of sociality with permanent complex groups being limited to the genera crossarchus, helogale, liberiictis, mungos, and suricata. our review also indicates that studies of solitary and social mongooses have been conducted within different theoretical frameworks: whereas solitary species and transitions to gregariousness have been mainly investigated in relation to ecological determinants, the study of social patterns of highly social mongooses has instead been based on reproductive skew theory. in some group‐living species, group size and composition were found to determine reproductive competition and cooperative breeding through group augmentation. infanticide risk and inbreeding avoidance connect social organisation and social structure with reproductive tactics and life histories, but their specific impact on mongoose sociality is still difficult to evaluate. however, the level of reproductive skew in social mongooses is not only determined by the costs and benefits of suppressing each other's breeding attempts, but also influenced by resource abundance. thus, dispersal, as a consequence of eviction, is also linked to the costs of co‐breeding in the context of food competition. by linking these facts, we show that the socio‐ecological model and reproductive skew theory share some determinants of social patterns. we also conclude that due to their long bio‐geographical isolation and divergent selection pressures, future studies of the social systems of the eupleridae will be of great value for the elucidation of general patterns in carnivore social evolution.
the claudin‐16 channel gene is transcriptionally inhibited by 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin d the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (casr) plays a major role in the maintenance of a physiological serum ionized calcium (ca2+) concentration by regulating the circulating levels of parathyroid hormone. it was molecularly identified in 1993 by brown et al. in the laboratory of dr. steven hebert with an expression cloning strategy. subsequent studies have demonstrated that the casr is highly expressed in the kidney, where it is capable of integrating signals deriving from the tubular fluid and/or the interstitial plasma. additional studies elucidating inherited and acquired mutations in the casr gene, the existence of activating and inactivating autoantibodies, and genetic polymorphisms of the casr have greatly enhanced our understanding of the role of the casr in mineral ion metabolism. allosteric modulators of the casr are the first drugs in their class to become available for clinical use and have been shown to treat successfully hyperparathyroidism secondary to advanced renal failure. in addition, preclinical and clinical studies suggest the possibility of using such compounds in various forms of hypercalcemic hyperparathyroidism, such as primary and lithium-induced hyperparathyroidism and that occurring after renal transplantation. this review addresses the role of the casr in kidney physiology and pathophysiology as well as current and in-the-pipeline treatments utilizing casr-based therapeutics.
what exactly do students learn when they practice equation solving?: refining knowledge components with the additive factors model student modeling plays a critical role in developing and improving instruction and instructional technologies. we present a technique for automated improvement of student models that leverages the datashop repository, crowd sourcing, and a version of the learning factors analysis algorithm. we demonstrate this method on eleven educational technology data sets from intelligent tutors to games in a variety of domains from math to second language learning. in at least ten of the eleven cases, the method discovers improved models based on better test-set prediction in cross validation. the improvements isolate flaws in the original student models, and we show how focused investigation of flawed parts of models leads to new insights into the student learning process and suggests specific improvements for tutor design. we also discuss the great potential for future work that substitutes alternative statistical models of learning from the edm literature or alternative model search algorithms.
association of polymorphism of the p22phox component of nadph oxidase in gastroduodenal diseases in japan backgroundincreased superoxide anion production increases oxidative stress and reduces nitric oxide bioactivity in vascular disease states. nad(p)h oxidase is an important source of superoxide in human blood vessels, and some studies suggest a possible association between polymorphisms in the nad(p)h oxidase cyba gene and atherosclerosis; however, no functional data address this hypothesis. we examined the relationships between the cyba c242t polymorphism and direct measurements of superoxide production in human blood vessels. methods and resultsvascular nad(p)h oxidase activity was determined in human saphenous veins obtained from 110 patients with coronary artery disease and identified risk factors. immunoblotting, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and dna sequencing showed that p22phox protein, mrna, and 242c/t allelic variants are expressed in human blood vessels. vascular superoxide production, both basal and nadh-stimulated, was highly variable between patients, but the presence of the cyba 242t allele was associated with significantly reduced vascular nad(p)h oxidase activity, independent of other clinical risk factors for atherosclerosis. conclusionsassociation of the cyba 242t allele with reduced nad(p)h oxidase activity in human blood vessels suggests that genetic variation in nad(p)h oxidase components may play a significant role in modulating superoxide production in human atherosclerosis.
prediction of ovarian cancer prognosis and response to chemotherapy by a serum-based multiparametric biomarker panel epithelial ovarian cancer constitutes one-quarter of the gynecologic malignancies, but is the leading cause of death among women with gynecologic cancer. in 6070% of the women, the disease is detected at a late stage when 5-year survival is poor. the recommended primary therapeutic approach for ovarian cancer is aggressive primarydebulking surgery followed by combination chemotherapy. the efficacy is routinely evaluated by repeated vaginal examination and transabdominal ultrasonography. however, these methods are unreliable for monitoring as progressive and recurrent disease often remains hidden until the patient presents with a large tumor mass. over the last few decades a variety of serological tumor markers has been proposed as a supplement to other non-invasive diagnostic methods. the main issue with tumor marker measurements is to obtain reliable information about changes in tumor mass before the changes are detectable by other methods. however, despite several attempts to identify useful serological markers for epithelial ovarian cancer, the results have not been as encouraging as for germ-cell tumors. the purpose of this paper is to review the applicability of ca 125, cea, tpa, tati, casa, and tetranectin in screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of ovarian carcinoma. several compounds other than those mentioned above are being investigated as markers in the early detection and management of ovarian cancer. some ofthese potential tumor markers listed in table 1 will not be discussed further in this review.
the role of ile3434thr xrcc7 gene polymorphism in differentiated thyroid cancer risk in an iranian population. pediatric thyroid cancer is a rare disease with an excellent prognosis. compared with adults, epithelial-derived differentiated thyroid cancer (dtc), which includes papillary and follicular thyroid cancer, presents at more advanced stages in children and is associated with higher rates of recurrence. because of its uncommon occurrence, randomized trials have not been applied to test best-care options in children. even in adults that have a 10-fold or higher incidence of thyroid cancer than children, few prospective trials have been executed to compare treatment approaches. we recognize that treatment recommendations have changed over the past few decades and will continue to do so. respecting the aggressiveness of pediatric thyroid cancer, high recurrence rates, and the problems associated with decades of long-term follow-up, a premium should be placed on treatments that minimize risk of recurrence and the adverse effects of treatments and facilitate follow-up. we recommend that total thyroidectomy and central compartment lymph node dissection is the surgical procedure of choice for children with dtc if it can be performed by a high-volume thyroid surgeon. we recommend radioactive iodine therapy for remnant ablation or residual disease for most children with dtc. we recommend long-term follow-up because disease can recur decades after initial diagnosis and therapy. considering the complexity of dtc management and the potential complications associated with therapy, it is essential that pediatric dtc be managed by physicians with expertise in this area.
a secure rfid authentication protocol for healthcare environments using elliptic curve cryptosystem p b f the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organization’s (jcaho) universal protocal, part of their national patient safety goal to prevent wrong site, wrong procedure, and wrong person surgery, became effective on july 1, 2004. this guideline applies to all operative and other invasive procedures, including those done in settings other than the operating room such as endoscopy, imaging, emergency services, special procedures, etc. standard pc.13.20 ep 9 of the jcaho standards requires that “the site, procedure, and patient are accurately identified and clearly communicated using active communication techniques, during a final verification process such as a time-out before the start of any surgical or invasive procedure.” in response to this patient safety initiative, new technology has been developed.
identification and quantification of cannabinoids in cannabis sativa l. plants by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry a method was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of five cannabinoids, viz. cannabidiol (cbd), cannabidiol acid (cbd-cooh), cannabinol (cbn), delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (thc), and 3'-carboxy-delta9-all-trans-tetrahydrocannabinol (thc-cooh) in cannabis products. the cannabinoids were extracted from the grinded cannabis samples with a mixture of methanol-chloroform and analysed using liquid chromatography with ion-trap-mass-spectrometry (lc-it-msn). for quantification the two most abundant diagnostic ms-ms ions of the analyte in the sample and external standard were monitored. for confirmation purposes the eu criteria as described in commission decision 2002/657/ec were followed. fully satisfactory results were obtained, that is, unequivocal confirmation according to the most stringent eu criteria was possible. the limits of quantification were 0.1 g/kg for cbd, 0.04 g/kg for cbd-cooh, 0.03 g/kg for cbn, 0.28 g/kg for thc and 9.9 g/kg for thc-cooh. the repeatabilities, defined by r.s.d., were 2% for cbn, thc and thc-cooh at the concentration levels of respectively 0.023, 3.3 and 113 g/kg and 5% for cbd-cooh at the level of 0.34 g/kg (n = 6).

transforming an embodied conversational agent into an efficient talking head: from keyframe-based animation to multimodal concatenation synthesis we describe how to create with machine learning techniques a generative, videorealistic, and speech animation module. a human subject is first recorded using a videocamera as he/she utters a pre-determined speech corpus. after processing the corpus automatically, a visual speech module is learned from the data that is capable of synthesizing the human subject's mouth uttering entirely novel utterances that were not recorded in the original video. the synthesized utterance is re-composited onto a background sequence, which contains natural head and eye movement. the final output is videorealistic in the sense that it looks like a video camera recording of the subject. at run time, the input to the system can be either real audio sequences or synthetic audio produced by a text-to-speech system, as long as they have been phonetically aligned.
transcriptome sequencing and expression analysis of cadmium (cd) transport and detoxification related genes in cd-accumulating salix integra heavy metal (hm)-accumulating herbaceous and woody plants are employed for phytoremediation. to develop improved strategies for enhancing phytoremediation efficiency, knowledge of the microstructural, physiological and molecular responses underlying hm-accumulation is required. here we review the progress in understanding the structural, physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying hm uptake, transport, sequestration and detoxification, as well as the regulation of these processes by signal transduction in response to hm exposure. the significance of genetic engineering for enhancing phytoremediation efficiency is also discussed. in herbaceous plants, hms are taken up by roots and transported into the root cells via transmembrane carriers for nutritional ions. the hms absorbed by root cells can be further translocated to the xylem vessels and unloaded into the xylem sap, thereby reaching the aerial parts of plants. hms can be sequestered in the cell walls, vacuoles and the golgi apparatuses. plant roots initially perceive hm stress and trigger the signal transduction, thereby mediating changes at the molecular, physiological, and microstructural level. signaling molecules such as phytohormones, reactive oxygen species (ros) and nitric oxide (no), modulate plant responses to hms via differentially expressed genes, activation of the antioxidative system and coordinated cross talk among different signaling molecules. a number of genes participated in hm uptake, transport, sequestration and detoxification have been functionally characterized and transformed to target plants for enhancing phytoremediation efficiency. fast growing woody plants hold an advantage over herbaceous plants for phytoremediation in terms of accumulation of high hm-amounts in their large biomass. presumably, woody plants accumulate hms using similar mechanisms as herbaceous counterparts, but the processes of hm accumulation and signal transduction can be more complex in woody plants.
predictors of noninstitutionalized survival 1 year after hip fracture we describe the development and validation of a scoring system for auditing orthopaedic surgery. it is a minor modification of the possum scoring system widely used in general surgery. the orthopaedic possum system which we have developed gives predictions for mortality and morbidity which correlate well with the observed rates in a sample of 2326 orthopaedic operations over a period of 12 months.
post-translational regulation of rotavirus protein nsp1 expression in mammalian cells ns53 (nsp1), the gene 5 product of the group a rotaviruses, is a minor nonstructural protein of 486 to 495 amino acids which binds zinc and contains an amino-terminal highly conserved cysteine-rich region that may form one or two zinc fingers. to study the structure-function of the gene 5 product, wild-type and mutant forms of ns53 were produced by using a recombinant baculovirus expression system and a recombinant vaccinia virus/t7 (vtf7-3) expression system. analysis of the rna-binding activity of the wild-type ns53 immobilized onto protein a-sepharose beads with ns53-specific antiserum showed that the protein exhibited specific affinity for all 11 rotavirus mrnas. the use of short virus-specific rna probes indicated that ns53 specifically recognizes an element located near the 5' ends of viral mrnas. analysis of the rna-binding activity of deletion mutants of ns53 showed that the rna-binding domain resides within the first 81 amino acids of the protein and that the highly conserved cysteine-rich region within this region of the protein is essential for the activity. gel electrophoresis and western immunoblot analyses of intracellular fractions derived from infected cells revealed that large amounts of ns53 were present in the cytosol and in association with the cytoskeletal matrix. indirect immunofluorescence analysis of cells programmed to transiently express mutant forms of ns53 using vtf7-3 indicated that the intracellular localization domain resides between amino acids 84 and 176 of ns53. together, these data show that the rna-binding domain and the intracellular localization domain lie upstream from the region of ns53 previously determined not to be essential for replication of rotaviruses in cell culture (j. hua and j. t. patton, virology 198:567-576, 1994).
coupling of prostate and thyroid cancer diagnoses in the united states importance we have previously reported on a doubling of thyroid cancer incidence-largely due to the detection of small papillary cancers. because they are commonly found in people who have died of other causes, and because thyroid cancer mortality had been stable, we argued that the increased incidence represented overdiagnosis.   objective to determine whether thyroid cancer incidence has stabilized.   design analysis of secular trends in patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer, 1975 to 2009, using the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (seer) program and thyroid cancer mortality from the national vital statistics system.   setting nine seer areas (seer 9): atlanta, georgia; connecticut; detroit, michigan; hawaii; iowa; new mexico; san francisco-oakland, california; seattle-puget sound, washington; and utah.   participants men and women older than 18 years diagnosed as having a thyroid cancer between 1975 and 2009 who lived in the seer 9 areas.   interventions none.   main outcomes and measures thyroid cancer incidence, histologic type, tumor size, and patient mortality. results since 1975, the incidence of thyroid cancer has now nearly tripled, from 4.9 to 14.3 per 100,000 individuals (absolute increase, 9.4 per 100,000; relative rate [rr], 2.9; 95% ci, 2.7-3.1). virtually the entire increase was attributable to papillary thyroid cancer: from 3.4 to 12.5 per 100,000 (absolute increase, 9.1 per 100,000; rr, 3.7; 95% ci, 3.4-4.0). the absolute increase in thyroid cancer in women (from 6.5 to 21.4 = 14.9 per 100,000 women) was almost 4 times greater than that of men (from 3.1 to 6.9 = 3.8 per 100,000 men). the mortality rate from thyroid cancer was stable between 1975 and 2009 (approximately 0.5 deaths per 100,000).   conclusions and relevance there is an ongoing epidemic of thyroid cancer in the united states. the epidemiology of the increased incidence, however, suggests that it is not an epidemic of disease but rather an epidemic of diagnosis. the problem is particularly acute for women, who have lower autopsy prevalence of thyroid cancer than men but higher cancer detection rates by a 3:1 ratio.
genuine genetic redundancy in maleylacetate-reductase-encoding genes involved in degradation of haloaromatic compounds by cupriavidus necator jmp134. the maleylacetate reductase from pseudomonas sp. strain b13 functioning in the modified ortho pathway was purified and digested with trypsin. the polypeptides separated by high-performance liquid chromatography were sequenced. alignments with the polypeptides predicted from the tfdf and tcbf genes located on plasmids pjp4 of the 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate-degrading alcaligenes eutrophus jmp134 and pp51 of the 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene-degrading pseudomonas sp. strain p51 as well as polypeptides predicted from the tfte gene located on the chromosome of the 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetate-degrading burkholderia cepacia ac1100 were obtained. in addition, the deduced protein sequence encoded by the nucleotide sequence downstream of clcd on plasmid pac27 of the 3-chlorobenzoate-degrading pseudomonas putida ac866 was tested for homology. significant sequence similarities with the polypeptides encoded by the tfdf, tcbf, and tfte genes as well as the nucleotide sequence downstream of the clcd gene gave evidence that these genes might encode maleylacetate reductases. a nad-binding motif in a beta alpha beta-element was detected.
inhibition of microrna-218 reduces hif-1α by targeting on robo1 in mice aortic endothelial cells under intermittent hypoxia obstructive sleep apnea (osa), characterized by intermittent hypoxia (ih), is linked with increased reactive oxygen species/reactive nitrogen species (ros/rns) and oxidative stress, which adversely affect the associated cardio-/cerebro-vascular disease in osa. yet, animal and a small number of human studies support activation of cardio-/cerebro-protective mechanisms as well. ros/rns are intricate and multifaceted molecules with multiple functions. at low-moderate concentrations ros/rns are considered "good", by regulating vital cellular functions. at higher levels, they are considered "bad" by promoting oxidative stress and damaging vital macromolecules through ischemia and reperfusion (i/r) injury. subsequently, ros/rns can get "ugly" by eliciting sterile inflammation and a multitude of deadly pathologies. what makes ros/rns good, bad, or ugly? a dynamic interplay between a large number of factors determines the outcomes. these include the types of ros/rns produced, their quantity, duration, frequency, intracellular localization, micro-environmental antioxidants, as well as the genetic make-up and life style related variables. this review presents the currently available data on redox biology in physiological/pathophysiological conditions and in osa/ih, in order to better understand the apparently contradictory findings on damage vs. repair. these findings are discussed within the context of the prevailing views on i/r associated ros/rns, and their potential implications to osa.
finite element modeling of short-wavelength folding on venus: implications for the plume hypothesis for crustal plateau formation crustal plateaus on venus constitute one of that planet’s most intriguing tectonic features. they host so-called “tessera” terrain, or deformed crust exhibiting two or more sets of intersecting tectonic lineaments, which comprises»8% of venus’ surface. major questions surrounding crustal plateaus and tessera terrain include: (1) what is the nature of crustal plateau deformation? what structures are present, and what are their spatial and temporal relations? (2) what is the global distribution of tessera terrain? does it form a global layer under the regional plains, cropping out in crustal plateaus, or is it confined to crustal plateaus? and (3) what are the implications of (1) and (2) for understanding the processes responsible for formation and deformation of crustal plateaus? structural and kinematic analyses reveal that deformation at ovda regio, venus largest crustal plateau, is characterized by linear shallow steep-sided troughs (ribbons), long arcuate long-wavelength folds, short mid-wavelength folds, and wide complex graben. temporal relations between structures lead to a three-phase regional strain history consisting of (1) layer-normal flattening of a thin competent membrane resulting in radially oriented, distributed extension (ribbon formation); (2) modest contraction of a thicker layer (concentric folding at plateau margins, interference folding in the plateau interior); and (3) limited extension localized at fold crests (graben formation). wavelength analysis of ribbons and folds places limits on the thickness of the competent layer during each stage of deformation and reflects an early shallow brittle‐ductile transition (bdt) that deepened with time. ovda’s deformation, topography, and gravity are all spatially correlated, strongly suggesting a genetic relationship between surface deformation and processes causing crustal thickening and plateau uplift. thus tessera terrain at ovda regio is likely confined to the topographically high plateau and does not extend beneath the surrounding regional plains. similar patterns persist at other crustal plateaus, indicating that tessera terrain is in general confined to crustal plateaus and does not form a globally continuous layer. ovda’s structures, their spatial and temporal relations, the resulting strain history, and the behavior of the bdt through time support a model of mantle plume upwelling in a thin lithospheric regime for crustal plateau formation and contradict previous downwelling models. similarities between structural and kinematic trends at ovda regio and other crustal plateaus lend support to this idea. c ∞ 1999 academic press
an algebraic formulation of inverse problems in mp dynamics metabolic p systems, shortly mp systems, are a special class of deterministic p systems, introduced for expressing biological metabolism. their dynamics are computed by a special type of regulated multiset rewriting. in this chapter the basic results on mp systems are indicated and a procedure is outlined for constructing mp models of biological processes from time series of observed dynamics.
evaluation of hydrologically relevant pcm climate variables and large-scale variability over the continental u.s. the land surface parameterization used with the community climate model (ccm3) and the climate system model (csm1), the national center for atmospheric research land surface model (ncar lsm1), has been modified as part of the development of the next version of these climate models. this new model is known as the community land model (clm2). in clm2, the surface is represented by five primary subgrid land cover types (glacier, lake, wetland, urban, vegetated) in each grid cell. the vegetated portion of a grid cell is further divided into patches of up to 4 of 16 plant functional types, each with its own leaf and stem area index and canopy height. the relative area of each subgrid unit, the plant functional type, and leaf area index are obtained from 1-km satellite data. the soil texture dataset allows vertical profiles of sand and clay. most of the physical parameterizations in the model were also updated. major model differences include: 10 layers for soil temperature and soil water with explicit treatment of liquid water and ice; a multilayer snowpack; runoff based on the topmodel concept; new formulation of ground and vegetation fluxes; and vertical root profiles from a global synthesis of ecological studies. simulations with ccm3 show significant improvements in surface air temperature, snow cover, and runoff for clm2 compared to lsm1. clm2 generally warms surface air temperature in all seasons compared to lsm1, reducing or eliminating many cold biases. annual precipitation over land is reduced from 2.35 mm day21 in lsm1 to 2.14 mm day21 in clm2. the hydrologic cycle is also different. transpiration and ground evaporation are reduced. leaves and stems evaporate more intercepted water annually in clm2 than lsm1. global runoff from land increases from 0.75 mm day21 in lsm1 to 0.84 mm day21 in clm2. the annual cycle of runoff is greatly improved in clm2, especially in arctic and boreal regions where the model has low runoff in cold seasons when the soil is frozen and high runoff during the snowmelt season. most of the differences between clm2 and lsm1 are attributed to particular parameterizations rather than to different surface datasets. important processes include: multilayer snow, frozen water, interception, soil water limitation to latent heat, and higher aerodynamic resistances to heat exchange from ground.
phenolic compounds in norway spruce as affected by boron nutrition at the end of the growing season boron, as borate, appears to have a role in partitioning metabolism between the glycolytic and pentose-shunt pathways. this effect results from the association of borate with 6-phosphogluconic acid, forming a virtual substrate that inhibits the action of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. in the absence of borate, the inhibition of the enzyme is released, and excess phenolic acids are formed. these acids also associate strongly with borate and thus develop an autocatalytic system for production of excess phenolic acids which cause necrosis of tissue and eventual death of the plant.
indexing method for multidimensional vector data multidimensional access methods have shown high potential for significant performance improvements in various application domains. however, only few approaches have made their way into commercial products. in commercial database management systems (dbmss) the btree is still the prevalent indexing technique. integrating new indexing methods into existing database kernels is in general a very complex and costly task. exceptions exist, as our experience of integrating the ub-tree into transbase, a commercial dbms, shows. the ub-tree is a very promising multidimensional index, which has shown its superiority over traditional access methods in different scenarios, especially in olap applications. in this paper we discuss the major issues of a ub-tree integration. as we will show, the complexity and cost of this task is reduced significantly due to the fact that the ubtree relies on the classical b-tree. even though commercial dbmss provide interfaces for index extensions, we favor the kernel integration because of the tight coupling with the query optimizer, which allows for optimal usage of the ubtree in execution plans. measurements on a real-world data warehouse show that the kernel integration leads to an additional performance improvement compared to our prototype implementation and competing index methods.
a multirisk approach to predicting chronicity of postpartum depression symptoms the development of a 10-item self-report scale (epds) to screen for postnatal depression in the community is described. after extensive pilot interviews a validation study was carried out on 84 mothers using the research diagnostic criteria for depressive illness obtained from goldberg's standardised psychiatric interview. the epds was found to have satisfactory sensitivity and specificity, and was also sensitive to change in the severity of depression over time. the scale can be completed in about 5 minutes and has a simple method of scoring. the use of the epds in the secondary prevention of postnatal depression is discussed.
anatomical features associated with venous congestion in diep flap using ct angiography with three-dimensional reconstruction background: despite improving outcomes, venous problems in the harvest of deep inferior epigastric artery perforator (diep) flaps remain the more common vascular complications. however, it is apparent that the venous anatomy of the anterior abdominal wall has not been described to the same extent as the arterial anatomy. previous anatomical studies have focused on cadaveric anatomy or excisional specimens. the current study uses in vivo computed tomographic angiography to evaluate this anatomy, in combination with a cadaveric radiographic study. methods: both cadaveric and in vivo studies were undertaken using eight whole fresh cadaveric specimens (16 sides) and 100 patients undergoing diep flap breast reconstruction (200 sides). the cadaveric component used direct catheter venography and the in vivo studies were undertaken using preoperative computed tomographic angiography, mapping in vivo venous flow. results: the location, caliber, course, and distribution of the superficial and deep inferior epigastric veins were recorded. the dominance of each system and their direction of drainage were described. mechanisms for poor venous drainage were postulated, including perforator size, midline crossover of the superficial inferior epigastric vein, and the superficial and deep inferior epigastric vein communications. the incidence of each of these anatomical factors was evaluated. conclusion: the cause of venous compromise is multifactorial, with the current study showing that preoperative computed tomographic angiography may predict venous problems during flap harvest, by demonstrating perforator diameter, midline crossover, and deep-superficial venous communications.
variance-sensitive choice in lemurs: constancy trumps quantity the last decade's lemur research includes successes in discovering new living and extinct species and learning about the distribution, biogeography, physiology, behavior, and ecology of previously little-studied species. in addition, in both the dry forest and rain forest, long-term studies of lemur demography, life history, and reproduction, have been completed in conjunction with data on tree productivity, phenology, and climate. lemurs contrast with anthropoids in several behavioral features, including female dominance, targeted female-female aggression, lack of sexual dimorphism regardless of mating system, sperm competition coupled with male-male aggression, high infant mortality, cathemerality, and strict seasonal breeding. hypotheses to explain these traits include the "energy conservation hypothesis" (ech) suggesting that harsh and unpredictable climate factors on the island of madagascar have affected the evolution of female dominance, and the "evolutionary disequilibrium hypotheses" (evdh) suggesting that the recent megafauna extinctions have influenced lemurs to become diurnal. these hypotheses are compared and contrasted in light of recent empirical data on climate, subfossils, and lemur behavior. new data on life histories of the rain forest lemurs at ranomafana national park give further support to the ech. birth seasons are synchronized within each species, but there is a 6-month distribution of births among species. gestation and lactation lengths vary among sympatric lemurs, but all lemur species in the rain forest wean in synchrony at the season most likely to have abundant resources. across-species weaning synchrony seen in ranomafana corroborates data from the dry forest that late lactation and weaning is the life history event that is the primary focus of the annual schedule. lemur adaptations may assure maximum offspring survival in this environment with an unpredictable food supply and heavy predation. in conclusion, a more comprehensive energy frugality hypothesis (efh) is proposed, which postulates that the majority of lemur traits are either adaptations to conserve energy (e.g., low basal metabolic rate (bmr), torpor, sperm competition, small group size, seasonal breeding) or to maximize use of scarce resources (e.g., cathemerality, territoriality, female dominance, fibrous diet, weaning synchrony). among primates, the isolated adaptive radiation of lemurs on madagascar may have been uniquely characterized by selection toward efficiency to cope with the harsh and unpredictable island environment.
recovering missing labels of crowdsourcing workers we consider the general problem of learning from labeled and unlabeled data, which is often called semi-supervised learning or transductive inference. a principled approach to semi-supervised learning is to design a classifying function which is sufficiently smooth with respect to the intrinsic structure collectively revealed by known labeled and unlabeled points. we present a simple algorithm to obtain such a smooth solution. our method yields encouraging experimental results on a number of classification problems and demonstrates effective use of unlabeled data.

nicotianamine synthase specifically expressed in root nodules of lotus japonicus basic cellular processes such as electron transport in photosynthesis and respiration require the precise control of iron homeostasis. to mobilize iron, plants have evolved at least two different strategies. the nonproteinogenous amino acid nicotianamine which is synthesized from three molecules of s-adenosyl-l-methionine, is an essential component of both pathways. this compound is missing in the tomato mutant chloronerva, which exhibits severe defects in the regulation of iron metabolism. we report the purification and partial characterization of the nicotianamine synthase from barley roots as well as the cloning of two corresponding gene sequences. the function of the gene sequence has been verified by overexpression in escherichia coli. further confirmation comes from reduction of the nicotianamine content and the exhibition of a chloronerva-like phenotype due to the expression of heterologous antisense constructs in transgenic tobacco plants. the native enzyme with an apparent mr of approximately 105 000 probably represents a trimer of s-adenosyl-l-methionine-binding subunits. a comparison with the recently cloned chloronerva gene of tomato reveals striking sequence homology, providing support for the suggestion that the destruction of the nicotianamine synthase encoding gene is the molecular basis of the tomato mutation.
data quality assessment and improvement abstract master data management (mdm) is a topic of increasing prominence both in the scientific and in the practitioners’ information systems (is) community. as a prerequisite for meeting strategic business requirements, such as compliance with regulations, business integration, or integrated customer management, mdm comprises numerous activities. one of the central activities is designing and maintaining the master data architecture. interestingly, though, the scientific community has remained almost silent with regard to the question as to how companies should proceed when designing the master data architecture. in order to shed light on this unexplored topic, the paper at hand presents the findings of a case study at bosch group. the case study shows that designing the master data architecture is a multidimensional task which requires balancing the interests of various organizational stakeholders, managing an array of technical opportunities, and meeting requirements of numerous master data classes. also, the case study suggests that taking advantage of architectural design patterns may be an appropriate way to adequately address the complexity of the task.

sodium phenylbutyrate and edaravone abrogate chronic restraint stress-induced behavioral deficits: implication of oxido-nitrosative, endoplasmic reticulum stress cascade, and neuroinflammation stress and the resulting increase in glucocorticoid levels have been implicated in the pathophysiology of depressive disorders. we investigated the effects of chronic restraint stress (crs: 6 hours × 28 days) on anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in rats and on the possible changes in glucocorticoid receptor (gr) expression as well as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf)-dependent neural function in the prefrontal cortex (pfc). we observed significant reductions in body weight gain, food intake and sucrose preference from 1 week after the onset of crs. in the 5th week of crs, we conducted open-field (oft), elevated plus-maze (epm) and forced swim tests (fst). we observed a decrease in the number of entries into open arms during the epm (anxiety-like behavior) and increased immobility during the fst (depression-like behavior). when the pfc was removed after crs and subject to western blot analysis, the gr expression reduced compared with control, while the levels of bdnf and its receptors remained unchanged. basal glutamate concentrations in pfc acute slice which were measured by high performance liquid chromatography were not influenced by crs. however, bdnf-induced glutamate release was attenuated after crs. these results suggest that reduced gr expression and altered bdnf function may be involved in chronic stress-induced anxiety--and depression-like behaviors.
associations between osteoprotegerin polymorphisms and bone mineral density: a meta-analysis given that osteoprotegerin plays an important role in bone remodeling, the osteoprotegerin gene may be a candidate locus for susceptibility to osteoporosis. the relation of polymorphisms in the promoter of the osteoprotegerin gene to bone mineral density (bmd) was examined in a japanese population-based prospective cohort study with randomly recruited subjects (1095 women and 1125 men for the 950t --> c polymorphism, 1094 women and 1127 men for the 245t --> g polymorphism). bmd at the radius was measured by peripheral quantitative computed tomography, and that for the total body, lumbar spine, right femoral neck, right trochanter, and right ward's triangle was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. genotypes were determined with a fluorescence-based allele-specific dna primer assay system. among 950t --> c genotypes, bmd for the proximal radius was lower in premenopausal women with the cc genotype than in those with the tt or tc genotype; the difference in bmd between the two groups was 3.9% (p=0.0075). among 245t --> g genotypes, bmd for the radius, total body, femoral neck, trochanter, and ward's triangle was lower in postmenopausal women with the gg genotype than in those with the tt or tg genotype, the tt genotype, or the tg genotype; the differences in bmd between the gg genotype and the tt or tg genotype were 19.8% for the distal radius (p=0.0015), 13.1% for the proximal radius (p=0.0095), 11.2% for the total body (p=0.0013), 12.9% for the femoral neck (p=0.0067), 18.7% for the trochanter (p=0.0008), and 27.1% for ward's triangle (p=0.0038). bmd was not associated with the 950t --> c or 245t --> g genotypes in men. the present results implicate the osteoprotegerin gene as a susceptibility locus for reduced bmd in japanese women.
the evidence on tiotropium bromide in asthma: from the rationale to the bedside despite current guidelines and the range of available treatments, over a half of patients with asthma continue to suffer from poor symptomatic control and remain at risk of future worsening. although a number of non-pharmacological measures are crucial for good clinical management of asthma, new therapeutic controller medications will have a role in the future management of the disease. several long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilators are under investigation or are available for the treatment of respiratory diseases, including tiotropium bromide, aclidinium bromide, glycopyrronium bromide, glycopyrrolate and umeclidinium bromide, although none is yet licensed for the treatment of asthma. a recent phase iii investigation demonstrated that the once-daily long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilator tiotropium bromide improves lung function and reduces the risk of exacerbation in patients with symptomatic asthma, despite the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ics) and long-acting β2-agonists (labas). this has prompted the question of what the rationale is for long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilators in asthma. bronchial smooth muscle contraction is the primary cause of reversible airway narrowing in asthma, and the baseline level of contraction is predominantly set by the level of ‘cholinergic tone’. patients with asthma have increased bronchial smooth muscle tone and mucus hypersecretion, possibly as a result of elevated cholinergic activity, which anticholinergic compounds are known to reduce. further, anticholinergic compounds may also have anti-inflammatory properties. thus, evidence suggests that long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilators might offer benefits for the maintenance of asthma control, such as in patients failing to gain control on ics and a laba, or those with frequent exacerbations.
secondary metabolite profiling, growth profiles and other tools for species recognition and important aspergillus mycotoxins a secondary metabolite is a chemical compound produced by a limited number of fungal species in a genus, an order, or even phylum. a profile of secondary metabolites consists of all the different compounds a fungus can produce on a given substratum and includes toxins, antibiotics and other outward-directed compounds. chemotaxonomy is traditionally restricted to comprise fatty acids, proteins, carbohydrates, or secondary metabolites, but has sometimes been defined so broadly that it also includes dna sequences. it is not yet possible to use secondary metabolites in phylogeny, because of the inconsistent distribution throughout the fungal kingdom. however, this is the very quality that makes secondary metabolites so useful in classification and identification. four groups of organisms are particularly good producers of secondary metabolites: plants, fungi, lichen fungi, and actinomycetes, whereas yeasts, protozoa, and animals are less efficient producers. therefore, secondary metabolites have mostly been used in plant and fungal taxonomy, whereas chemotaxonomy has been neglected in bacteriology. lichen chemotaxonomy has been based on few biosynthetic families (chemosyndromes), whereas filamentous fungi have been analysed for a wide array of terpenes, polyketides, non-ribosomal peptides, and combinations of these. fungal chemotaxonomy based on secondary metabolites has been used successfully in large ascomycete genera such as alternaria, aspergillus, fusarium, hypoxylon, penicillium, stachybotrys, xylaria and in few basidiomycete genera, but not in zygomycota and chytridiomycota.
in praise of impredicativity: a contribution to the formalisation of meta-programming we describe a fragment of higher-order horn logic which can be used as a higher-order extension of prolog. it allows the programmer to axiomatize predicates of predicates and operations on predicates. the restrictions defining the fragment ensure that the higher-order predicates and operations defined are monotonic and continuous—that they are enumeration operators. as a result, the fragment is well behaved both denotationally and operationally. denotationally, the meaning of a program is its minimal herbrand model, using standard extensional higher-order model theory. operationally, it can still be implemented efficiently with standard techniques, using an adapted resolution theorem prover. the fragment is in fact (almost) a subset of hilog—a “pure” subset with simple semantics and a straightforward implementation.
studying work practices: a key factor in understanding accidents on the level triggered by a balance disturbance the vast majority of the published workplace slips, trips and falls (stf) literature is exceedingly narrow in its focus and often ignores wider systems issues in workplace stf aetiology. there is little recognition within the published literature of the importance of latent failures or the upstream organisational and cultural contexts within which workplace stf occur. this is unfortunate, as a systems approach to workplace stf analysis, that is inclusive of latent design and work organisation factors that often shape worker behaviour patterns related to stf risk (e.g. rushing, risk taking), is fundamental to the development of effective prevention measures. the aims of this paper are to provide an understanding of workplace stf causation that is cognisant of the potential role of both active and latent failures in stf causation. the paper presents an ergonomics model for workplace stf analysis that highlights information processing in stf aetiology, the stf incident process and the interaction between latent and active failures in stf causation. the paper draws upon ergonomics research conducted in a range of occupational contexts to illustrate the key features of the model as it applies to workplace stf. implications of the model for analysis and prevention of stf are discussed.
the common chymotrypsinogen c (ctrc) variant g60g (c.180t) increases risk of chronic pancreatitis but not recurrent acute pancreatitis in a north american population pancreatitis is a complex, progressively destructive inflammatory disorder. alcohol was long thought to be the primary causative agent, but genetic contributions have been of interest since the discovery that rare prss1, cftr and spink1 variants were associated with pancreatitis risk. we now report two associations at genome-wide significance identified and replicated at prss1-prss2 (p < 1 × 10−12) and x-linked cldn2 (p < 1 × 10−21) through a two-stage genome-wide study (stage 1: 676 cases and 4,507 controls; stage 2: 910 cases and 4,170 controls). the prss1 variant likely affects disease susceptibility by altering expression of the primary trypsinogen gene. the cldn2 risk allele is associated with atypical localization of claudin-2 in pancreatic acinar cells. the homozygous (or hemizygous in males) cldn2 genotype confers the greatest risk, and its alleles interact with alcohol consumption to amplify risk. these results could partially explain the high frequency of alcohol-related pancreatitis in men (male hemizygote frequency is 0.26, whereas female homozygote frequency is 0.07).
variance-sensitive choice in lemurs: constancy trumps quantity the last decade's lemur research includes successes in discovering new living and extinct species and learning about the distribution, biogeography, physiology, behavior, and ecology of previously little-studied species. in addition, in both the dry forest and rain forest, long-term studies of lemur demography, life history, and reproduction, have been completed in conjunction with data on tree productivity, phenology, and climate. lemurs contrast with anthropoids in several behavioral features, including female dominance, targeted female-female aggression, lack of sexual dimorphism regardless of mating system, sperm competition coupled with male-male aggression, high infant mortality, cathemerality, and strict seasonal breeding. hypotheses to explain these traits include the "energy conservation hypothesis" (ech) suggesting that harsh and unpredictable climate factors on the island of madagascar have affected the evolution of female dominance, and the "evolutionary disequilibrium hypotheses" (evdh) suggesting that the recent megafauna extinctions have influenced lemurs to become diurnal. these hypotheses are compared and contrasted in light of recent empirical data on climate, subfossils, and lemur behavior. new data on life histories of the rain forest lemurs at ranomafana national park give further support to the ech. birth seasons are synchronized within each species, but there is a 6-month distribution of births among species. gestation and lactation lengths vary among sympatric lemurs, but all lemur species in the rain forest wean in synchrony at the season most likely to have abundant resources. across-species weaning synchrony seen in ranomafana corroborates data from the dry forest that late lactation and weaning is the life history event that is the primary focus of the annual schedule. lemur adaptations may assure maximum offspring survival in this environment with an unpredictable food supply and heavy predation. in conclusion, a more comprehensive energy frugality hypothesis (efh) is proposed, which postulates that the majority of lemur traits are either adaptations to conserve energy (e.g., low basal metabolic rate (bmr), torpor, sperm competition, small group size, seasonal breeding) or to maximize use of scarce resources (e.g., cathemerality, territoriality, female dominance, fibrous diet, weaning synchrony). among primates, the isolated adaptive radiation of lemurs on madagascar may have been uniquely characterized by selection toward efficiency to cope with the harsh and unpredictable island environment.
a forecast of targeting leukemia stem cells by nanomedicine tim-3 was initially identified on activated th1, th17, and tc1 cells and induces t cell death or exhaustion after binding to its ligand, gal-9. the observed relationship between dysregulated tim-3 expression on t cells and the progression of many clinical diseases has identified this molecule as an important target for intervention in adaptive immunity. recent data have shown that it also plays critical roles in regulating the activities of macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells, mast cells, natural killer cells, and endothelial cells. although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, dysregulation of tim-3 expression on these innate immune cells leads to an excessive or inhibited inflammatory response and subsequent autoimmune damage or viral or tumor evasion. in this review, we focus on the expression and function of tim-3 on innate immune cells and discuss (1) how tim-3 is expressed and regulated on different innate immune cells; (2) how it affects the activity of different innate immune cells; and (3) how dysregulated tim-3 expression on innate immune cells affects adaptive immunity and disease progression. tim-3 is involved in the optimal activation of innate immune cells through its varied expression. a better understanding of the physiopathological role of the tim-3 pathway in innate immunity will shed new light on the pathogenesis of clinical diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, chronic viral infections, and cancer, and suggest new approaches to intervention.
engagement of young adult cancer survivors within a facebook-based physical activity intervention purpose young adult cancer survivors have a number of increased health and psychosocial risks. to minimize these risks, they must address any modifiable risk factors, for example increase their physical activity (pa) and reduce stress. unfortunately, more than half of young survivors remain sedentary, and few participate in a structured form of relaxation. this study evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and effects of a theory-based pa and meditation intervention for young survivors.   methods young adult cancer survivors (age 18-39 years) were randomized to receive the 12-week "relaxation and exercise for wellness" (renew) intervention right away (intervention group) or after a 12-week wait (control group). participants were assessed at baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks.   results thirty-five survivors were enrolled and randomized. results indicate that 89% of intervention calls were delivered, and most participants felt that intervention goals and the number and duration of intervention calls were appropriate. satisfaction ratings indicate that the intervention was acceptable, and 100% of participants would recommend it to others. comparison of the intervention and control groups at the 12-week assessment (i.e., before controls received the intervention) revealed that the intervention group was performing more minutes of at least moderate intensity pa/week (p = 0.002; m = 113.8, se = 23.5 vs. m = -8.7, se = 27.1) and outperformed controls on a test of cardiovascular fitness (p = 0.008; m = -1.76, se = 0.41 vs. m = -0.03, se = 0.45). when data from the intervention and control groups were pooled, pre- to post-intervention analyses indicated a trend toward improved mood.   conclusion this theory-based intervention for young adult cancer survivors was feasible and acceptable, and may have helped survivors increase pa, improve fitness, and enhance mood.
exposure to aedes aegypti bites induces a mixed-type allergic response following salivary antigens challenge in mice il-4-dependent and -independent igg1 abs differ in their ability to induce mast cell degranulation as measured by passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (pca). mice immunized with ova or piii (fraction of ascaris suum) produced high titers of igg1 as shown by elisa and pca. in contrast, another a. suum fraction, pi, elicited igg1 abs with no pca activity. igg1 with anaphylactic activity required il-4, as igg1 responses to ova and piii in il-4-/- mice gave no pca. pi-specific igg1 was il-4-independent, because no difference was found between the responses of il-4-/- and il-4+/+ mice. significant pca reactions were elicited, however, with pi-specific igg1 from il-12-/- or anti-ifn-gamma ab-treated mice, although less ab was measured by elisa. these results indicate that one type of igg1 has anaphylactic activity and its synthesis is il-4-dependent, being inhibited by il-12 or ifn-gamma; the other lacks this activity and its synthesis is stimulated by il-12 or ifn-gamma.
the transcription factor nfatp plays a key role in susceptibility to tb in mice in the present study, we investigated in vivo the infection and apc functions of dendritic cells (dc) and macrophages (mφ) after administration of live mycobacteria to mice. experiments were conducted with mycobacterium bovis bacillus calmette-guerin (bcg) or a rbcg expressing a reporter ag. following infection of mice, dc and mφ were purified and the presence of immunogenic peptide/mhc class ii complexes was detected ex vivo on sorted cells, as was the secretion of il-12 p40. we show in this study that dc is a host cell for mycobacteria, and we provide an in vivo detailed picture of the role of mφ and dc in the mobilization of immunity during the early stages of a bacterial infection. strikingly, bcg bacilli survive but remain stable in number in the dc leukocyte subset during the first 2 wk of infection. as ag presentation by dc is rapidly lost, this suggests that dc may represent a hidden reservoir for mycobacteria.
epidemiology of leptospirosis in africa: a systematic review of a neglected zoonosis and a paradigm for ‘one health’ in africa leptospirosis is a widespread but under-reported cause of morbidity and mortality. global re-emergence of leptospirosis has been associated with the growth of informal urban settlements in which rodents are thought to be important reservoir hosts. understanding the multi-host epidemiology of leptospirosis is essential to control and prevent disease. a cross-sectional survey of rodents in the kibera settlement in nairobi, kenya was conducted in september–october 2008 to demonstrate the presence of pathogenic leptospires. a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed that 41 (18.3%) of 224 rodents carried pathogenic leptospires in their kidneys, and sequence data identified leptospira interrogans and l. kirschneri in this population. rodents of the genus mus (37 of 185) were significantly more likely to be positive than those of the genus rattus (4 of 39; odds ratio = 15.03). questionnaire data showed frequent contact between humans and rodents in kibera. this study emphasizes the need to quantify the public health impacts of this neglected disease at this and other urban sites in africa.

specialization of binaural responses in ventral auditory cortices the acoustical cues for sound location are generated by spatial- and frequency-dependent filtering of propagating sound waves by the head and external ears. although rats have been a common model system for anatomy, physiology, and psychophysics of localization, there have been few studies of the acoustical cues available to rats. here, directional transfer functions (dtfs), the directional components of the head-related transfer functions, were measured in six adult rats. the cues to location were computed from the dtfs. in the frontal hemisphere, spectral notches were present for frequencies from approximately 16 to 30 khz; in general, the frequency corresponding to the notch increased with increases in source elevation and in azimuth toward the ipsilateral ear. the maximum high-frequency envelope-based interaural time differences (itds) were 130 mus, whereas low-frequency (<3.5 khz) fine-structure itds were 160 mus; both types of itds were larger than predicted from spherical head models. interaural level differences (ilds) strongly depended on location and frequency. maximum ilds were <10 db for frequencies <8 khz and were as large as 20-40 db for frequencies >20 khz. removal of the pinna eliminated the spectral notches, reduced the acoustic gain and ilds, altered the acoustical axis, and reduced the itds.
rna polymerase elongation factors. the universal bacterial transcription elongation factor nusa mediates elongation activities of rna polymerase. by itself, nusa induces transcription pausing and facilitates intrinsic termination, but nusa also is a cofactor of antiterminators that antagonize pausing and prevent termination. we show that nusa is required for lambda-related phage 82 antiterminator q(82) to construct a stable complex in which rna-based termination mechanisms have restricted access to the emerging transcript; this result suggests a locale for both q(82) and nusa near the beta flap domain of rna polymerase. furthermore, as nusa is not required for the antipausing activity of q(82) in vitro, we distinguish two distinct activities of antiterminators, namely antipausing and rna occlusion, and discuss their roles in q(82) function.
irreversible hyperoxidation of peroxiredoxin 2 is caused by tert-butyl hydroperoxide in human red blood cells a thiol-dependent antioxidant protein (hrprp) was previously reported as a predominant antioxidant protein in human red blood cell (rbc). the analysis of amino acid sequence of hrprp with those of human prp-like gene products indicates that hrprp is identical to brain prp (hprp). this protein act as a peroxidase linked to thioredoxin (trx)/thioredoxin reductase (tr). until now, there was no evidence for trx/tr system in rbc. the existence of the trx/tr system in rbc was immunologically determined. a 58-kda protein showing tr activity was partially purified from human rbc and characterized. our results reveal that hrprp act as a new type of peroxidase supported by trx/tr system in human rbc.
gender classification from iris images using fusion of uniform local binary patterns iris is claimed to be one of the best biometrics. we have collected a large data set of iris images, intentionally sampling a range of quality broader than that used by current commercial iris recognition systems. we have re-implemented the daugman-like iris recognition algorithm developed by masek. we have also developed and implemented an improved iris segmentation and eyelid detection stage of the algorithm, and experimentally verified the improvement in recognition performance using the collected dataset. compared to masek's original segmentation approach, our improved segmentation algorithm leads to an increase of over 6% in the rank-one recognition rate.
curcumin attenuates acute graft-versus-host disease severity via in vivo regulations on th1, th17 and regulatory t cells increased recognition of the limits of conventional medicine has helped drive the growing interest in complementary and alternative medicine which is now being commonly used in patients with chronic diseases, including individuals with crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. recently, scientific interest has unraveled the beneficial pharmacological effects of curcumin. we present an updated concise review of currently available in vitro, animal and clinical studies demonstrating the therapeutic effect of herbal medication in inflammatory bowel disease.
sparc/osteonectin, an endogenous mechanism for targeting albumin to the blood–cerebrospinal fluid interface during brain development osteonectin (sparc, culture shock protein, bm-40) is a widely distributed glycoprotein which binds calcium and several extracellular matrix proteins, including interstitial collagens and thrombospondin, but whose physiologic role remains undefined. in the present studies, we have demonstrated that immunoreactive osteonectin is present in the distal cortical tubule and medullary tubules of murine kidney. we surveyed the renal epithelial cell lines llc-pk1, mdck, and ok for the expression of mrna encoding osteonectin. we found that osteonectin mrna is expressed by llc-pk1 and ok cells but not by mdck cells, as well as by adult kidney from several species. calcitonin and vasopressin, agents which increase camp in these cells, were found to decrease steady-state osteonectin mrna concentrations. we found that llc-pk1 cells produced osteonectin protein, that the protein was localized to intracellular granules, and that the protein bound hydroxyapatite in vitro. pulse-chase analysis revealed that osteonectin was secreted from the cell layer to the medium after a lag time of four to six hours and was secreted preferentially from the basolateral domain of the cell. the preferential secretion of the calcium-binding protein osteonectin from the renal epithelial cell is consistent with several possible functions, including a structural extracellular matrix protein, a participant in transepithelial ion transport, and an inhibitor of extracellular calcification.
differential function of the two atg4 homologues in the aggrephagy pathway in caenorhabditis elegans* autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved intracellular catabolic system. during caenorhabditis elegans development, autophagy plays an important role in many physiological processes, including survival under starvation conditions, modulation of life span, and regulation of necrotic cell death caused by toxic ion‐channel variants. recently, it has been demonstrated that during embryogenesis, basal levels of autophagy selectively remove a group of proteins in somatic cells, including the aggregate‐prone components of germline p granules. degradation of these protein aggregates provides a genetic model to identify essential autophagy components and also to elucidate how the autophagic machinery selectively recognizes and degrades specific targets during animal development.
roles of phospho-gsk-3β in myocardial protection afforded by activation of the mitochondrial k atp channel. glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (gsk-3beta) is a multifunctional ser/thr kinase that plays important roles in necrosis and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. a major mechanism of cell necrosis is the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mptp), which consists of multiple protein subunits, including adenine nucleotide translocase (ant). the threshold for mptp opening is elevated by phosphorylation of gsk-3beta at ser9, which reduces activity of this kinase. how inactivation of gsk-3beta suppresses mptp opening has not been fully understood, but evidence to date suggests that preservation of hexokinase-ii in the mptp complex, inhibition of cyclophilin-d-ant binding, inhibition of p53 and inhibition of ant into the mitochondria are contributory. gsk-3beta phosphorylation is a step to which multiple protective signaling pathways converge, and thus gsk-3beta phosphorylation is crucial in cardioprotection of a variety of interventions against ischemia/reperfusion injury. apoptosis of cardiomyocytes by pressure overload or ischemia/reperfusion is also suppressed by inactivation of gsk-3beta, in which reduced phosphorylation of p53, heat shock factor-1 and myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1 and inhibition of bax translocation might be involved. considering predominant roles of gsk-3beta in cardiomyocyte death, manipulation of this protein kinase is a promising strategy for myocardial protection in coronary artery disease and heart failure.
psoriasis in a nationwide cohort study of patients with celiac disease. objectives to find out whether patients with psoriatic arthritis (psoa) have an increased prevalence of antibodies to gliadin (aga) and of coeliac disease.   methods one hundred and fourteen psoa patients with skin disease of 20+/-13 yr and joint disease of 11+/-10 yr duration answered a questionnaire concerning their medical history and underwent clinical examination, including radiology. serum iga aga and igg aga, iga antibodies to endomysium and immunoglobulins, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr) and c-reactive protein (crp) concentration were determined.   results five of the 114 patients (4.4%) had coeliac disease. after exclusion of these five patients, the mean iga aga concentration was significantly higher (p=0.0005) than that in a reference group. none of the patients had iga antibodies to endomysium. the mean serum iga concentration was significantly increased and igm decreased. patients with a high concentration of iga aga had significantly higher esr and crp and a longer duration of morning stiffness than those with a low aga concentration.   conclusions patients with psoa have an increased prevalence of raised serum iga aga and of coeliac disease. patients with raised iga aga seem to have more pronounced inflammation than those with a low iga aga concentration.

ebf factors drive expression of multiple classes of target genes governing neuronal development neuronal specification is often seen as a multistep process: earlier regulators confer broad neuronal identity and are followed by combinatorial codes specifying neuronal properties unique to specific subtypes. however, it is still unclear whether early regulators are re-deployed in subtype-specific combinatorial codes, and whether early patterning events act to restrict the developmental potential of postmitotic cells. here, we use the differential peptidergic fate of two lineage-related peptidergic neurons in the drosophila ventral nerve cord to show how, in a feedforward mechanism, earlier determinants become critical players in later combinatorial codes. amongst the progeny of neuroblast 5–6 are two peptidergic neurons: one expresses fmrfamide and the other one expresses nplp1 and the dopamine receptor dopr. we show the hlh gene collier functions at three different levels to progressively restrict neuronal identity in the 5–6 lineage. at the final step, collier is the critical combinatorial factor that differentiates two partially overlapping combinatorial codes that define fmrfamide versus nplp1/dopr identity. misexpression experiments reveal that both codes can activate neuropeptide gene expression in vast numbers of neurons. despite their partially overlapping composition, we find that the codes are remarkably specific, with each code activating only the proper neuropeptide gene. these results indicate that a limited number of regulators may constitute a potent combinatorial code that dictates unique neuronal cell fate, and that such codes show a surprising disregard for many global instructive cues.
a population-based analysis of behavior problems in children with cerebral palsy. a half-hour diagnostic psychiatric interview was described for use with 7- to 12-year-old children. four studies of reliability and validity were reported. inter-rater reliability was examined by having children interviewed by one psychiatrist while a second psychiatrist observed without taking part. at the end of the interview, without any discussion, both psychiatrists independently made separate ratings of the child's psychiatric state. re-test reliability was examined by having a further series of children interviewed twice, once by each author, with an interval of 1 to 30 days between the interviews. validity was tested by comparing the interview findings for a randomly selected sample of the general population and a sample of children judged to have psychiatric disorder on the basis of information from teachers and parents. the interviewing psychiatrist knew only the child's name and age and was unaware of the selection group from which the child was drawn.  a short psychiatric interview with a child was found to be a reasonably sensitive diagnostic instrument which could give rise to reliable and valid judgments on whether the child exhibited any psychiatric disorder. however, on the whole, individual ratings on specific aspects of behaviour proved to be less reliable than the overall psychiatric diagnosis. there were also marked differences in the reliability and usefulness of the various specific ratings.  depression proved to be a more difficult item than anxiety to rate reliably, but both were found to be reasonably efficient in the differentiation of the child with psychiatric disorder. the child's attention or persistence on cognitive tasks was also rated fairly reliably, and proved to be a surprisingly good indicator of psychiatric disorder. the child's emotional responsiveness at interview and the relationship he formed with the psychiatrist could be rated reliably, and these items also effectively differentiated children with psychiatric disorder from "control" children in the general population.  some of the inferences involved in the diagnostic process were examined in relation to the assessment of anxiety. it was shown, for example, that whereas fidgetiness is commonly taken to be an indicator of anxiety this assumption is frequently misleading. tension and tremulousness were also less useful indicators of anxiety than tearfulness, an anxious expression and preoccupation with anxiety topics at interview.  the main uses and limitations of the interview have been briefly discussed. it is concluded that the interview with the child (aged 7 to 12 years) forms a useful part of the diagnostic procedure in child psychiatry.
elicitation of diosgenin production in trigonella foenum-graecum l. seedlings by heavy metals and signaling molecules abstract a23187 is a carboxylic acid antibiotic which simultaneously uncouples oxidative phosphorylation and inhibits atpase of rat liver mitochondria incubated in a magnesium-free medium. the antibiotic acts as a freely mobile carrier to transport calcium and magnesium, but not potassium, from an aqueous medium buffered at ph 7.4 into a bulk organic phase. a23187 causes a progressive release of endogenous magnesium and inorganic phosphate from mitochondria incubated with substrate, but little change in calcium or potassium content. if edta is added, a23187 severely depletes intramitochondrial calcium and magnesium in l30 s and produces loss of intramitochondrial potassium. release of state 4 succinate oxidation by a23187 is inhibited by lanthanum chloride, ruthenium red, ((ethylene bis)oxyethylene nitrilo)tetraacetic acid (egta), edta, mgcl2, and atp. inhibition by egta (or edta) of a23187's uncoupling is reversed readily by calcium but not magnesium. in the presence of a23187 plus egta, mitochondria retain only 2 to 3 nmoles of mg2+ per mg of protein but remain coupled and phosphorylate adp at 80 to 85% of control rates with β-hydroxybutyrate or succinate as substrate. under these conditions, coupled phosphorylation supported by glutamate, and atp hydrolysis are severely depressed, but increasing concentrations of magnesium in the incubating medium prevent these inhibitions. it is proposed that a cyclic, energy-dissipating flux of mitochondrial calcium accounts for uncoupling by a23187, whereas inhibition of atpase and glutamate oxidation and increased potassium permeability of mitochondria result from antibiotic-mediated magnesium efflux.
involvement of human chorionic gonadotropin in regulating vasculogenic mimicry and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α expression in ovarian cancer cells luteinizing hormone (lh)/human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg) bind to a common transmembrane glycoprotein receptor, which is a member of the g protein-coupled receptor family. in human, the lh/hcg receptor gene is composed of 11 exons and 10 introns and its coding region is over 60 kb long. human chorionic gonadotropin is a glycoprotein hormone containing a cystine-knot folding motif that is found in peptide growth factors known to activate the expression of homeogenes. in the present work we present evidence that hcg down-regulates all the three transcripts of hoxa1 at early stages of hcg treatment in the immortalized human breast epithelial cells (mcf-10f), whereas hoxa1-s1, the largest transcript, as well as hoxa1-s3, the smallest transcript, were up-regulated in the cancer cell lines mda-mb-231 and mcf-7, respectively. this divergent reaction of hcg was associated with the pattern of lh/hcg receptors and splicing forms expression in human breast epithelial cells. mcf-10f cells expressed the full-length (1191 bp) compared with the cancer-derived cells mcf-7 and mda-mb-231 that was weakly or not expressed. isoform 1 (1117 bp) was silent in mcf-10f and expressed weakly in the cancer cells. the isoforms 2 (1006 bp) and 3 (932 bp) of lh/hcg gene receptor were silent in all the cell lines, whereas isoforms 4 (892 bp), 6 (626 bp) and 7 (441 bp) were silent in mcf-10f cells and expressed in the cancer cell lines. instead isoform 5 (707 bp) showed in the three cell lines the strongest expression in mcf-10f cells. this difference in the expression of alternate splicing of lh/hcg receptor mrna among the mcf-10f, mcf-7 and mda-mb-231 cells, may explain the divergent response of these cells to hoxa1 activation by hcg.
bcl-2 antisense (g3139, genasense) enhances the in vitro and in vivo response of epstein-barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative disease to rituximab. posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disease (ptld) is virtually always associated with epstein-barr virus (ebv) infection. bcl-2 and other proteins that confer resistance to apoptosis have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of malignancies including lymphomas. one ebv protein, bhrf1, is a homologue of bcl-2, whereas another, the latency membrane protein 1 (lmp-1), upregulates bcl-2 expression in vitro. in the present study, we used immunohistochemistry to study the expression of these viral and cellular proteins as well as a variety of other ebv-encoded proteins in ptld. bhrf1 was not detected in any ptld specimen, whereas bcl-2 was shown in 12 of 17 lesions examined. with one exception, all lmp1-positive cases also expressed bcl-2 and the absence of lmp1 was always associated with a lack of bcl-2 expression. the results do not support a role for the ebv homologue of bcl-2 in ptld, but they do support a role for viral induction of bcl-2 expression.
photobiomodulation therapy for the management of radiation-induced dermatitis purposethe purpose of this study was to review the effect of low-level laser therapy (lllt) in the management of breast cancer-related lymphedema (bcrl).methodsa systematic review of seven databases for clinical trials for lllt in the management of bcrl published between 1990 and 2011 was performed.resultsa total of eight studies on 230 patients were found. the methodological qualities of the selected studies were assessed with the physiotherapy evidence database scale, and the studies were categorized according to sackett’s levels of evidence. five studies were graded at evidence level ii. two studies were graded at evidence level iii, and the remaining study was graded at evidence level v.conclusionsthere is moderate to strong evidence for the effectiveness of lllt for the management of bcrl from five small studies of acceptable methodological quality. a dose of 1–2 j/cm2 per point applied to several points covering the fibrotic area can reduce limb volume following bcrl. further well-designed, large-scale studies are required to determine more precisely how effective lllt may be in bcrl.
the challenges of breastfeeding in a complex world a critical aims the study investigated factors empowering women to continue breastfeeding despite experiencing extraordinary difficulties. the study documented the experiences and characteristics of women who continued to breastfeed (continuing cohort) and those who weaned (non-continuing cohort) despite extraordinary difficulties.   design retrospective case control.   methods the study was undertaken in south-east queensland, australia in 2004. forty women (20 in each cohort) were recruited over six months. both quantitative (breastfeeding knowledge questionnaire) and qualitative (semi-structured interviews) data were collected. this paper describes the qualitative data.   results women from both cohorts expressed idealistic expectations about breastfeeding and experienced psychological distress due to their breastfeeding problems. those who continued breastfeeding used coping strategies and exhibited personal qualities that assisted them to overcome the difficulties experienced. women who continued to breastfeed were more likely to report relying on a health professional they could trust for support. this latter cohort were also more likely to report having peers with which they shared their experiences. non-continuing women expressed feelings of guilt and inadequacy following weaning and were more likely to feel isolated.   conclusions this study has highlighted the methods women use to deal with breastfeeding problems. it has also revealed modificable factors that can improve breastfeeding duration.   relevance to clinical practice the findings indicate that clinicians should: *provide information which accurately reflects the breastfeeding experience; *ensure systems are in place so that effective postnatal support for breastfeeding difficulties is available; *consider screening to ascertain levels of psychological distress, sadness and disillusionment among breastfeeding women; *design educational interventions with elements of cognitive skills, problem-solving and self-efficacy training to equip women with the skills to overcome any experienced difficulties.
transgenic gene silencing strategies for virus control one of the most severe diseases of cultivated tomato worldwide is caused by tomato yellow leaf curl virus (tylcv), a geminivirus transmitted by the whitefly bemisia tabaci. here we describe the application of antisense rnas to interfere with the disease caused by tylcv. the target of the antisense rna is the rare messenger rna of the rep protein, encoded by the c1 gene. transgenic nicotiana benthamiana plants expressing c1 antisense rna were obtained and shown to resist infection by tylcv. some of the resistant lines are symptomless, and the replication of challenge tylcv almost completely suppressed. the transgenes mediating resistance were shown to be effective through at least two generations of progeny.
context-outcome associations underlie context-switch effects after partial reinforcement in human predictive learning contextual conditioning during relative validity training was explored in 3 experiments that used an appetitive pavlovian conditioning preparation with rats. magazine entries were the conditioned response. in experiment 1, true-discrimination (td: ax+, bx-) training generated weaker conditioning of x than did pseudodiscrimination (pd: ax+/-, bx+/-) training. the context showed a similar relative validity effect. also, both pd training and simple partial reinforcement (x+/-) reduced contextual conditioning more than did unsignaled food, a demonstration of relative validity using partial reinforcement. experiments 2 and 3 used within-subject and between-subjects designs, respectively, and showed that relative validity was determined by the summation of differences in conditioning to both the common element (x) and the context. our results are consistent with an attentional model or with a computational comparator model but not with the rescorla-wagner (r. a. rescorla & a. r. wagner, 1972) model.
biomedical factors associated with hospitalization of older adults: the bambuí health and aging study (bhas). background the aims of the study were to describe the pattern of hospital utilization (acute and mental health sectors) of the paisley-renfrew midspan cohort and assess the influence of biological, behavioural and social 'risk factors' (established at the time of screening) on subsequent hospital admissions.   method a cohort analysis was carried out in paisley and renfrew, two post-industrial towns in west central scotland. this used a linked data set covering a 23 year follow-up period to combine original 'risk'-related data with subsequent routine hospital admissions data. the subjects were 8349 women and 7057 men, aged 45-64 in the early to mid-1970s, and representing approximately 80 per cent of the eligible population. the main outcome measures were patterns of hospital utilization (acute and mental health sectors), 'any acute hospital admission', 'a serious acute hospital admission' and 'death' (relative risks of each outcome were calculated for all risk factors).   results the following patterns of hospital utilization were found. only 5 per cent experienced a mental health admission but mean stay was long (265 bed days per cohort member admitted). in contrast, 79 per cent experienced at least one acute hospital stay. the age-specific proportions of cohort members requiring admission increased over time but the growth in acute episodes was even higher (suggesting increasing rates of multiple admission). for non-survivors, 42 per cent of all acute episodes (55 per cent of bed days) took place during the 12 months before death. analysis of risk factors (using cox's proportional hazards model) of 'any admission' and 'a serious admission' showed forced expiratory volume (fev1), age, sex, smoking status, blood pressure, blood sugar, body mass index, cholesterol and deprivation category to be important predictors.   conclusions despite the desirability of alternative settings of care for the chronically ill and dying, a high proportion of hospital bed days were required near the time of death. the absolute size of the demand for hospital services within the cohort was strikingly large and increasing over time. strategies to address the tide of rising admissions will have to confront the increasing proportion of individuals requiring admission as well as the growth in multiple admissions. those who were at higher risk of admission were the older members of the cohort (especially men), those with low fev1, smokers, those who were underweight or obese, the small number with abnormal levels of blood sugar, those with high blood pressure and those who lived in the most deprived areas. thus, programmes which affect these determinants of ill health may be useful in reducing age-specific admission rates.
a phase i dose-escalation study of the vegfr inhibitor tivozanib hydrochloride with weekly paclitaxel in metastatic breast cancer purpose: to assess the maximum tolerated dose (mtd)/dose-limiting toxicities (dlt), safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of tivozanib, a potent and selective oral vegf receptor (vegfr) tyrosine kinase inhibitor. experimental design: dose levels of 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mg/d tivozanib for 28 days followed by 14 days of medication were explored in patients with advanced solid tumors. results: forty-one patients were enrolled. animal data incorrectly predicted toxicity, resulting in dlts at the starting dose (2.0 mg) consisting of grade 3 proteinuria and hypertension and grade 3 ataxia. at 1.0 mg, no dlt was observed. at an intermediate dose (1.5 mg), 1 patient experienced dlt consisting of grade 3 hypertension. this dose was determined as the mtd. of 10 additional patients treated at 1.5 mg, 1 patient each experienced grade 3 hypertension and grade 3 fatigue, and 2 patients experienced grade 3 and 4 transaminase elevation. in 12 additional patients treated at 1.0 mg, no dlt was observed. pharmacokinetics displayed long absorption time, dose proportional exposure, and a half-life of 4.7 days. plasma levels of vegf-a and soluble vegfr-2 showed dose-dependent increases and decreases, respectively. dynamic contrast-enhanced mri indicated reduction in tumor perfusion. clinical activity was observed in renal cell cancer, colorectal cancer, and other tumors. conclusion: tivozanib was well tolerated with manageable side effects. the pharmacokinetics profile revealed that tivozanib was suitable for once-daily dosing. encouraging and durable clinical activity was observed. the recommended daily dose of tivozanib in a 4-week-on and 2-week-off dosing regimen is 1.5 mg. clin cancer res; 17(22); 7156–63. ©2011 aacr.
geneseer: a sage for gene names and genomic resources ensembl (http://www.ensembl.org/) is a bioinformatics project to organize biological information around the sequences of large genomes. it is a comprehensive source of stable automatic annotation of individual genomes, and of the synteny and orthology relationships between them. it is also a framework for integration of any biological data that can be mapped onto features derived from the genomic sequence. ensembl is available as an interactive web site, a set of flat files, and as a complete, portable open source software system for handling genomes. all data are provided without restriction, and code is freely available. ensembl's aims are to continue to "widen" this biological integration to include other model organisms relevant to understanding human biology as they become available; to "deepen" this integration to provide an ever more seamless linkage between equivalent components in different species; and to provide further classification of functional elements in the genome that have been previously elusive.
journey from black to pink gums: management of melanin induced physiological gingival hyper pigmentation. a smile expresses a feeling of joy and success and also reveals self-confidence and kindness in an individual. a holistic smile is dictated not only by the shape, position and color of the teeth but also by the health of the gingival tissues. gingival appearance is an important component of an attractive smile. melonin, carotene and hemoglobin are the most common natural pigments contributing to the normal color of gingiva. although physiologic and ethnic melanin pigmentation is not a medical problem, complaints about "black gums" are common. for de-pigmentation of gingiva, different treatment modalities have been reported such as bur abrasion, scraping with scalpel, partial thickness flap, gingivectomy, cryotherapy, electrosurgery, lasers, free gingival autografting, sub-epithelial connective tissue graft and combination techniques. in the present case reports, scalpel surgery and electrosurgery were performed for gingival de-pigmentation, which are simple and effective. the esthetic results were pleasing and healing was uneventful. patients were satisfied with the outcome at three month follow-up as evidenced from their feedback.
measuring multiple parameters of cd8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in human cancers by image analysis immune cell infiltration is common to many tumors and has been recognized by pathologists for more than 100 years. the application of digital imaging and objective assessment software allowed a concise determination of the type and quantity of immune cells and their location relative to the tumor and, in the case of colon cancer, characterized overall survival better than ajcc tnm staging. subsequently, expression of pd-l1, by 50% or more tumor cells, identified nsclc patients with double the response rate to anti-pd-1. soon, automated staining methods will improve reproducibility of multiplex staining and allow for clia standards so that multiplex staining can be used to make clinical decisions. ultimately, machine-learning algorithms will help interpret data from tissue images and lead to improved delivery of precision medicine.

association of the breast cancer antiestrogen resistance protein 1 (bcar1) and bcar3 scaffolding proteins in cell signaling and antiestrogen resistance* the adapter molecule p130cas (cas) plays a role in cellular processes such as proliferation, survival, cell adhesion, and migration. the ability of cas to promote migration has been shown to be dependent upon its carboxyl terminus, which contains a bipartite binding site for the protein tyrosine kinase c-src (src). the association between src and cas enhances src kinase activity, and like cas, src plays an important role in cell proliferation and migration. in this study, we show that src and cas function cooperatively to promote cell migration in a manner that depends upon kinase-active src. another carboxyl-terminal binding partner of cas, and-34/bcar3 (and-34), functions synergistically with cas to enhance src activation and cell migration. the carboxyl-terminal guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain of and-34, as well as the activity of its putative target rap1, contribute to these events. a mechanism through which and-34 may regulate cas-dependent cell migration is suggested by the finding that cas becomes redistributed from focal adhesions to lamellipodia located at the leading edge of and-34 overexpressing cells. these data thus provide insight into how cas and and-34 may function together to stimulate src signaling pathways and promote cell migration.
combinatorial gene regulatory functions underlie ultraconserved elements in drosophila identifying the sequences that direct the spatial and temporal expression of genes and defining their function in vivo remains a significant challenge in the annotation of vertebrate genomes. one major obstacle is the lack of experimentally validated training sets. in this study, we made use of extreme evolutionary sequence conservation as a filter to identify putative gene regulatory elements, and characterized the in vivo enhancer activity of a large group of non-coding elements in the human genome that are conserved in human–pufferfish, takifugu (fugu) rubripes, or ultraconserved in human–mouse–rat. we tested 167 of these extremely conserved sequences in a transgenic mouse enhancer assay. here we report that 45% of these sequences functioned reproducibly as tissue-specific enhancers of gene expression at embryonic day 11.5. while directing expression in a broad range of anatomical structures in the embryo, the majority of the 75 enhancers directed expression to various regions of the developing nervous system. we identified sequence signatures enriched in a subset of these elements that targeted forebrain expression, and used these features to rank all ∼3,100 non-coding elements in the human genome that are conserved between human and fugu. the testing of the top predictions in transgenic mice resulted in a threefold enrichment for sequences with forebrain enhancer activity. these data dramatically expand the catalogue of human gene enhancers that have been characterized in vivo, and illustrate the utility of such training sets for a variety of biological applications, including decoding the regulatory vocabulary of the human genome.
tnf induces caspase-dependent inflammation in renal endothelial cells through a rho- and myosin light chain kinase-dependent mechanism. studies in the rat have pointed to a role for intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (icam-1) in the pathogenesis of acute tubular necrosis. these studies used antibodies, which may have nonspecific effects. we report that renal icam-1 mrna levels and systemic levels of the cytokines il-1 and tnf-alpha increase 1 h after ischemia/ reperfusion in the mouse. we sought direct proof for a critical role for icam-1 in the pathophysiology of ischemic renal failure using mutant mice genetically deficient in icam-1. icam-1 is undetectable in mutant mice in contrast with normal mice, in which icam-1 is prominent in the endothelium of the vasa recta. mutant mice are protected from acute renal ischemic injury as judged by serum creatinine, renal histology, and animal survival . renal leukocyte infiltration, quantitated morphologically and by measuring tissue myeloperoxidase, was markedly less in icam-1-deficient than control mice. to evaluate whether prevention of neutrophil infiltration could be responsible for the protection observed in the mutant mice, we treated normal mice with antineutrophil serum to reduce absolute neutrophil counts to < 100 cells/mm3. these neutrophil-depleted animals were protected against ischemic renal failure. anti-1cam-1 antibody protected normal mice against renal ischemic injury but did not provide additional protection to neutrophil-depleted animals. thus, icam-1 is a key mediator of ischemic acute renal failure likely acting via potentiation of neutrophilendothelial interactions.
additivity of entanglement of formation of two three-level-antisymmetric states additivity of the holevo capacity is proved for product channels, under the condition that one of the channels is a unital qubit channel, with the other completely arbitrary. as a byproduct this proves that the holevo bound is the classical information capacity of such qubit channels, and provides an explicit formula for this classical capacity. additivity of minimal entropy and multiplicativity of p-norms are also proved under the same assumptions. the proof relies on a new bound for the p-norm of an output state from the half-noisy phase-damping channel.
nevus comedonicus: a case series abstract: we report extensive nevus comedonicus in a female patient that involved half of her body entirely, with infected cystic lesions as well as typical scars, limited by the midline. the lesions worsened at the beginning of puberty. a brief review of the literature highlights the histopathologic, etiopathogenic, and therapeutic aspects.
tradeoffs between the axial resolution and the signal-to-noise ratio in elastography this paper presents a theoretical framework for performance characterization in strain estimation, which includes the effect of signal decorrelation, quantization errors due to the finite temporal sampling rate, and electronic noise. an upper bound on the performance of the strain estimator in elastography is obtained from a strain filter constructed using these limits. the strain filter is a term used to describe the nonlinear filtering process in the strain domain (due to the ultrasound system and signal processing parameters) that allows the elastographic depiction of a limited range of strains from the compressed tissue. the strain filter predicts the elastogram quality by specifying the elastographic signal-to-noise ratio (snr/sub e/), sensitivity, and the strain dynamic range at a given resolution. the dynamic range is limited by decorrelation errors for large tissue strain values, and electronic noise for low strain values. tradeoffs between different techniques used to enhance elastogram image quality may also be analyzed using the strain filter.
endoscopic management of antrochoanal polyps: a single uk centre’s experience antrochoanal polyps (acp) are benign lesions that arise from the mucosa of the maxillary sinus, grow into the maxillary sinus and reach the choana, and nasal obstruction being their main symptom. it is an interesting model to compare the pathophysiological mechanisms with those of bilateral nasal polyposis (np). there is a lack of research in some areas of acp, which have to become the main aims for future investigations of this disease. in comparison to np, acps are usually unilateral and appear in younger patients. macroscopically, they have a cystic intramaxillary portion and a solid intranasal portion. microscopically, they are similar to a maxillary cyst of the mucosa. nasal endoscopy, computed tomography and magnetic resonance are the main diagnostic techniques. surgery is the indicated treatment for acp, with endoscopic resection the most recommended. simple avulsion of the polyp has a high rate of recurrence, whereas the caldwell-luc procedure is associated with damage of the maxillary and dental growth centres. more research is needed to establish the relationship between chronic sinusitis and acp. further work is also needed to investigate the role of inflammatory mediators (histamine, ige, adhesion molecules, paf), as well as metalloproteases and nasal remodelling, and tumour marker expression in a cp.
sparc/osteonectin, an endogenous mechanism for targeting albumin to the blood–cerebrospinal fluid interface during brain development osteonectin (sparc, culture shock protein, bm-40) is a widely distributed glycoprotein which binds calcium and several extracellular matrix proteins, including interstitial collagens and thrombospondin, but whose physiologic role remains undefined. in the present studies, we have demonstrated that immunoreactive osteonectin is present in the distal cortical tubule and medullary tubules of murine kidney. we surveyed the renal epithelial cell lines llc-pk1, mdck, and ok for the expression of mrna encoding osteonectin. we found that osteonectin mrna is expressed by llc-pk1 and ok cells but not by mdck cells, as well as by adult kidney from several species. calcitonin and vasopressin, agents which increase camp in these cells, were found to decrease steady-state osteonectin mrna concentrations. we found that llc-pk1 cells produced osteonectin protein, that the protein was localized to intracellular granules, and that the protein bound hydroxyapatite in vitro. pulse-chase analysis revealed that osteonectin was secreted from the cell layer to the medium after a lag time of four to six hours and was secreted preferentially from the basolateral domain of the cell. the preferential secretion of the calcium-binding protein osteonectin from the renal epithelial cell is consistent with several possible functions, including a structural extracellular matrix protein, a participant in transepithelial ion transport, and an inhibitor of extracellular calcification.
muscle strength is impaired in men but not in women living with hiv taking antiretroviral therapy. the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids) wasting syndrome (aws) is a devastating complication of human immunodeficiency virus infection characterized by a disproportionate decrease in lean body mass. the pathogenesis of the aws is unknown, but recent data suggest that endogenous secretion of the potent anabolic hormone, testosterone; is decreased in 30-50% of men with aids. however, it is unknown whether decreased androgen levels are associated with decreased lean body mass and/or functional decreases in muscle strength and aerobic capacity in hypogonadal men with the aws. in addition, testosterone is known to have stimulatory effects on gh secretion, and the loss of these effects on the gh-insulin-like growth factor i (igf-i) axis may be an additional mechanism of decreased lean body mass in this population. twenty hypogonadal subjects (free-testosterone < 12 pg/ml) with weight loss > 10% of preillness weight or absolute weight < 90% ideal body weight (ibw) were enrolled in the study. none of the subjects were receiving megace. lean body mass and fat-free mass were determined by potassium-40 isotope analysis (40k) and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, respectively, and analyzed with respect to gonadal function by linear regression analysis. muscle mass was determined by urinary creatinine excretion, and exercise functional capacity was assessed by a 6-min walk test, a sit-to-stand test, and a timed get-up-and-go test. results also were compared with gonadal function by regression analysis. igf-i and mean overnight gh levels, determined from frequent sampling (q20 min from 2000-0800 h), were compared with results obtained from age- and sex-matched normal controls. subjects were 26-58 yr of age (39 +/- 7 yr, mean +/- sd) with a cd4 cell count of 150 +/- 186 cells/mm3. serum levels of fsh were elevated in 30% of the subjects. muscle mass was significantly reduced, compared with expected mass for height (23.3 +/- 5.5 vs. 29.3 +/- 1.7 kg, p = 0.0001) and was decreased disproportionately to weight (77% of expected value for muscle mass vs. 93% of expected value for weight). free-testosterone levels were correlated with total body potassium (r = 0.45, p < 0.05) and muscle mass (r = 0.45, p < 0.05). total-testosterone levels were correlated with exercise functional capacity (r = 0.64, p = 0.01 for the sit-to-stand test and r = 0.53, p < 0.05 for the 6-min walk test). mean gh levels were significantly increased (3.03 +/- 1.76 vs. 0.90 +/- 0.37 ng/ml, p < 0.001) and igf-i levels decreased (167 +/- 66 vs. 225 +/- 69 ng/ml, p < 0.01), compared with age- and sex-matched eugonadal controls. gh levels were inversely correlated with caloric intake (r = -0.60, p = 0.02) and percent fat mass by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (r = 0.58, p = 0.02). six additional hypogonadal subjects receiving megace for aids wasting were analyzed separately. nutritional status and parameters of body composition were compared in the megace and non-megace-treated subjects. no significant differences in caloric intake, lean body mass, fat mass, or muscle mass were demonstrated. these data demonstrate that changes in body composition, including loss of lean body and muscle mass, and deterioration in exercise functional capacity are highly correlated with androgen levels in hypogonadal men with the aws. furthermore, our data demonstrate significantly increased gh levels and decreased igf-i in association with low weight in this population. these data suggest that androgen deficiency combined with classical gh resistance may contribute to the critical loss of lean body and muscle mass in hypogonadal men with the aws. these data are the first to link muscle and lean body wasting with progressive gonadal dysfunction among the large percentage of men with aids wasting who are hypogonadal. this demonstrates the need for additional studies to determine the efficacy of gonadal steroid replacement to increase lean body mass in this population.
the relation of exocytosis and rapid endocytosis to calcium entry evoked by short repetitive depolarizing pulses in rat melanotropic cells a number of calcium buffers were examined for their ability to reduce evoked transmitter release when injected into the presynaptic terminal of the squid giant synapse. injection of egta was virtually ineffective at reducing transmitter release, even at estimated intracellular concentrations up to 80 mm. conversely, the buffer 1,2-bis(2- aminophenoxy)ethane-n,n,n′,n′-tetraacetic acid (bapta), which has an equilibrium affinity for calcium similar to that of egta at ph 7.2, produced a substantial reduction in transmitter release when injected presynaptically. this effect of bapta was reversible, presumably because the buffer diffused out of the terminal and into uninjected regions of the presynaptic axon. bapta derivatives with estimated intracellular calcium dissociation constants (kd) ranging from 0.18 to 4.9 microm were effective at reducing transmitter release at similar estimated concentrations. a bapta derivative with an estimated intracellular kd of 31 mm was less effective. bapta did not affect presynaptic action potentials or calcium spikes in ways that could explain its ability to reduce transmitter release. the relative effects of presynaptic injections of bapta and derivatives are consistent with the calcium-buffering capability of these compounds if the presynaptic calcium transient that triggers release is hundreds of microm or larger. the superior potency of bapta compared to egta apparently results from the faster calcium-binding kinetics of bapta and suggests that the calcium-binding molecule that triggers release binds calcium in considerably less than 200 microsec and is located very close to calcium channels.
global stability analysis of competitive neural networks with mixed time-varying delays and discontinuous neuron activations this paper introduces a general class of neural networks with arbitrary constant delays in the neuron interconnections, and neuron activations belonging to the set of discontinuous monotone increasing and (possibly) unbounded functions. the discontinuities in the activations are an ideal model of the situation where the gain of the neuron amplifiers is very high and tends to infinity, while the delay accounts for the finite switching speed of the neuron amplifiers, or the finite signal propagation speed. it is known that the delay in combination with high-gain nonlinearities is a particularly harmful source of potential instability. the goal of this paper is to single out a subclass of the considered discontinuous neural networks for which stability is instead insensitive to the presence of a delay. more precisely, conditions are given under which there is a unique equilibrium point of the neural network, which is globally exponentially stable for the states, with a known convergence rate. the conditions are easily testable and independent of the delay. moreover, global convergence in finite time of the state and output is investigated. in doing so, new interesting dynamical phenomena are highlighted with respect to the case without delay, which make the study of convergence in finite time significantly more difficult. the obtained results extend previous work on global stability of delayed neural networks with lipschitz continuous neuron activations, and neural networks with discontinuous neuron activations but without delays.
the c57bl/6j mice offspring originated from a parental generation exposed to tannery effluents shows object recognition deficits. the problem of water pollution acquires greater relevance in the context of a developing agrarian economy like pakistan. even though, the leather industry is a leading economic sector in pakistan, there is an increasing environmental concern regarding tanneries because they produce large amounts of potentially toxic wastewater containing both trivalent and hexavalent chromium, which are equally hazardous for human population, aquaculture and agricultural activities in the area. therefore, we defined the scope of the present study as to employ different bioassays to determine the eco-toxic potential of tannery effluent wastewater (tw) and its chromium based components, i.e., potassium dichromate (k(2)cr(2)o(7)) and chromium sulfate cr(2)(so(4))(3). particle-induced x-ray emission (pixe) analysis of tw was carried out to determine the concentration of chromium in tw and then equal concentrations of hexavalent (k(2)cr(2)o(7)) and trivalent chromium cr(2)(so(4))(3) were obtained for this study. cytotoxicity assay, artemia bioassay and phytotoxicity assay was utilized to investigate the eco-toxicological potential of different concentrations of tw, k(2)cr(2)o(7) and cr(2)(so(4))(3). all the dilutions of tw, k(2)cr(2)o(7) and cr(2)(so(4))(3) presented concentration dependent cytotoxic effects in these assays. the data clearly represents that among all three tested materials, different dilutions of k(2)cr(2)o(7) caused significantly more damage (p<0.001) to vero cell, brine shrimp and germination of maize seeds. interestingly, the overall toxicity effects of tw treated groups were subsequent to k(2)cr(2)o(7) treated group. based on biological evidences presented in this article, it is concluded that hexavalent chromium (k(2)cr(2)o(7)) and tw has got significant eco-damaging potential clearly elaborating that environmental burden in district kasur is numerous and high levels of chromium is posing a considerable risk to the human population, aquaculture and agricultural industry that can obliterate ecosystem surrounding the tanneries.
direct kinematic modeling of the upper limb during trunk-assisted reaching. the finite element method described in this study provides an easy method to simulate the kinetics of multibody mechanisms. it is used in order to develop a musculoskeletal model of the shoulder mechanism. each relevant morphological structure has been represented by an appropriate element. for the shoulder mechanism two special-purpose elements have been developed: a surface element representing the scapulothoracic gliding plane and a curved-truss element to represent muscles which are wrapped around bony contours. the model contains four bones, three joints, three extracapsular ligaments, the scapulothoracic gliding plane and 20 muscles and muscle parts. in the model, input variables are the positions of the shoulder girdle and humerus and the external load on the humerus. output variables are muscles forces subject to an optimization procedure in which the mechanical stability of the glenohumeral joint is one of the constraints. four different optimization criteria are compared. for 12 muscles, surface emg is used to verify the model. since the optimum muscle length and force-length relationship are unknown, and since maximal emg amplitude is length dependent, verification is only possible in a qualitative sense. nevertheless, it is concluded that a detailed model of the shoulder mechanism has been developed which provides good insight into the function of morphological structures.
deafferentation-based pathophysiological differences in phantom sound: tinnitus with and without hearing loss background different mechanisms have been proposed to be involved in tinnitus generation, among them reduced lateral inhibition and homeostatic plasticity. on a perceptual level these different mechanisms should be reflected by the relationship between the individual audiometric slope and the perceived tinnitus pitch. whereas some studies found the tinnitus pitch corresponding to the maximum hearing loss, others stressed the relevance of the edge frequency. this study investigates the relationship between tinnitus pitch and audiometric slope in a large sample. methodology this retrospective observational study analyzed 286 patients. the matched tinnitus pitch was compared to the frequency of maximum hearing loss and the edge of the audiogram (steepest hearing loss) by t-tests and correlation coefficients. these analyses were performed for the whole group and for sub-groups (uni- vs. bilateral (117 vs. 338 ears), pure-tone vs. narrow-band (340 vs. 115 ears), and low and high audiometric slope (114 vs. 113 ears)). findings for the right ear, tinnitus pitch was in the same range and correlated significantly with the frequency of maximum hearing loss, but differed from and did not correlate with the edge frequency. for the left ear, similar results were found but the correlation between tinnitus pitch and maximum hearing loss did not reach significance. sub-group analyses (bi- and unilateral, tinnitus character, slope steepness) revealed identical results except for the sub-group with high audiometric slope which revealed a higher frequency of maximum hearing loss as compared to the tinnitus pitch. conclusion the study-results confirm a relationship between tinnitus pitch and maximum hearing loss but not to the edge frequency, suggesting that tinnitus is rather a fill-in-phenomenon resulting from homeostatic mechanisms, than the result of deficient lateral inhibition. sub-group analyses suggest that audiometric steepness and the side of affected ear affect this relationship. future studies should control for these potential confounding factors.
neuronal network analysis axons in the cerebral cortex receive synaptic input at the axon initial segment almost exclusively from γ-aminobutyric acid–releasing (gabaergic) axo-axonic cells (aacs). the axon has the lowest threshold for action potential generation in neurons; thus, aacs are considered to be strategically placed inhibitory neurons controlling neuronal output. however, we found that aacs can depolarize pyramidal cells and can initiate stereotyped series of synaptic events in rat and human cortical networks because of a depolarized reversal potential for axonal relative to perisomatic gabaergic inputs. excitation and signal propagation initiated by aacs is supported by the absence of the potassium chloride cotransporter 2 in the axon.
the case against delusional parasitosis abstract: in 2004, an article in the journal of the new york entomological society claimed that individuals with delusory parasitosis actually suffer from collembola infestations. the article has been critiqued for poor methodology and results that contradict all knowledge about collembolans. less easily accounted for has been a figure in the article purporting to show a collembolan in a skin scraping. the image appears to have been altered using photo manipulation software to an unacceptable degree, and this paper demonstrates that to be the case. the altered figure represents creation of nonexistent data, a form of scientific misconduct. whether the deception is deliberate or a product of an otherwise well-meaning author ignorant of the limits of acceptable image manipulation is unknown, but the result is peer-reviewed support for a conclusion that complicates patient treatment. in the current era of computers, even regional entomology journals must have detailed standards for what kind of images and image manipulations are acceptable for publication.
interleukin-17 causes rho-kinase-mediated endothelial dysfunction and hypertension. chronic treatment with the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin leads to hypertension; however, the mechanisms are unknown. rapamycin binds fk506 binding protein 12 and its related isoform 12.6 (fkbp12/12.6) and displaces them from intracellular ca release channels (ryanodine receptors) eliciting a ca leak from the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum. we tested whether this ca leak promotes conventional protein kinase c–mediated endothelial no synthase phosphorylation at thr495, which reduces production of the vasodilator no. rapamycin treatment of control mice for 7 days, as well as genetic deletion of fkbp12.6, increased systolic arterial pressure significantly compared with controls. untreated aortas from fkbp12.6 / mice and in vitro rapamycin-treated control aortas had similarly decreased endothelium-dependent relaxation responses and no production and increased endothelial no synthase thr495 phosphorylation and protein kinase c activity. inhibition of either conventional protein kinase c or ryanodine receptor restored endothelial no synthase thr495 phosphorylation and endothelial function to control levels. rapamycin induced a small increase in basal intracellular ca levels in isolated endothelial cells, and rapamycin or fkbp12.6 gene deletion decreased acetylcholine-induced intracellular ca release, all of which were reversed by ryanodine. these data demonstrate that displacement of fkbp12/12.6 from ryanodine receptors induces an endothelial intracellular ca leak and increases conventional protein kinase c–mediated endothelial no synthase thr495 phosphorylation leading to decreased no production and endothelial dysfunction. this molecular mechanism may, in part, explain rapamycin-induced hypertension.

single-photon techniques for standard cmos digital ics photon counting is useful in space-based imagers wherever quantitative light-intensity evaluation is necessary. various types of radiation, from cosmic rays to high-energy proton beams to gamma radiation, have an effect on the functionality and accuracy of imagers and the literature is extensive [1,2]. techniques to maximize sensor tolerance have also been developed for a number of years and several imagers resistant to up to 30mrad (si) of gamma radiation have been reported. these sensors have several shortcomings: either significant noise performance degradation, up to several orders of magnitude [2], or unacceptably high pre-radiation noise levels [3]. in addition, many radiation-tolerant sensors use dedicated processes, thus possibly limiting their suitability for mass-market applications [4].
broad phonetic class recognition in a hidden markov model framework using extended baum-welch transformations in this paper, we present a noise robust landmark detection and segmentation algorithm using a sinusoidal model representation of speech. we compare the performance of our approach under noisy conditions against two segmentation methods used in the summit segment-based speech recognizer, a full segmentation approach and an approach that detects segment boundaries based on spectral change. the word error rate of the spectral change segmentation method degrades rapidly in the presence of noise, while the sinusoidal and full segmentation models degrade more gracefully. however, the full segmentation method requires the largest computation time of the three approaches. we find that our new algorithm provides the best tradeoff between word accuracy and computation time of the three methods. furthermore, we find that our model is robust when speech is contaminated by various noise types
bdnf exerts contrasting effects on peripheral myelination of ngf-dependent and bdnf-dependent drg neurons k-252 compounds, which share a common polyaromatic aglycon structure, are rather general and potent inhibitors of various protein kinases, including protein kinase c and tyrosine-specific protein kinases, and possibly act by interfering at or near the atp binding site. however, chemical modifications in their sugar moiety can result in high specificity of the inhibitory action and, furthermore, can induce other stimulatory and inhibitory effects on nerve cells. these compounds are of particular interest because, in intact cells, they inhibit the actions of ngf and other neurotrophins without diminishing comparable actions of other growth factors. this effect seems to reflect a direct inhibitory action on trk neurotrophin receptor proteins. at concentrations lower than those necessary to inhibit neurotrophin actions, k-252a and k-252b have been shown to potentiate the stimulatory effects of nt-3 on different neurons in culture and on pc12 cells. the structural requirements for this effect seem to be different from those for the inhibition of neurotrophin actions. these findings raise the possibility of development of compounds of high selectivity, able to inhibit or potentiate the transduction mechanisms of individual neurotrophins, and identify k-252a and k-252b as lead compounds for the development of such selective molecules. specific inhibitors and stimulators of neurotrophins would be valuable tools to investigate biological functions of the neurotrophins in vitro and in vivo. furthermore, it is possible that, in the future, highly selective drugs with agonistic or antagonistic actions on neurotrophin mechanisms could become therapeutically useful in the treatment of neurological disease and injury.
scp160p is required for translational efficiency of codon-optimized mrnas in yeast the yeast spindle pole body (spb), the functional equivalent of mammalian centrosome, duplicates in g1/s phase of the cell cycle and then becomes inserted into the nuclear envelope. here we describe a link between spb duplication and targeted translation control. when insertion of the newly formed spb into the nuclear envelope fails, the sesa network comprising the gyf domain protein smy2, the translation inhibitor eap1, the mrna-binding protein scp160 and the asc1 protein, specifically inhibits initiation of translation of pom34 mrna that encodes an integral membrane protein of the nuclear pore complex, while having no impact on other mrnas. in response to sesa, pom34 mrna accumulates in the cytoplasm and is not targeted to the er for cotranslational translocation of the protein. reduced level of pom34 is sufficient to restore viability of mutants with defects in spb duplication. we suggest that the sesa network provides a mechanism by which cells can regulate the translation of specific mrnas. this regulation is used to coordinate competing events in the nuclear envelope.
expression of metabotropic glutamate receptors in nodose ganglia and the nucleus of the solitary tract. the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mglur) cdnas were originally cloned from rat, except for the mouse cdna clone encoding mglur8. mouse mglur8 couples weakly to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase, thus hindering the characterization of its pharmacological properties. we isolated a rat mglur8 cdna that encodes a protein of 908 amino acids. in situ hybridization revealed prominent mglur8 mrna expression in olfactory bulb, pontine gray, lateral reticular nucleus of the thalamus, and piriform cortex. less abundant expression was detected in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and mammillary body. glutamate evoked pertussis toxin-sensitive potassium currents in xenopus laevis oocytes coexpressing mglur8 and g protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels. mglur8 was also activated by the group iii-specific agonist l-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid; (2(s), 1'(s), 2'(s)]- 2-(carboxycyclopropyl)glycine, which has been frequently used as a selective group ii agonist; and the nonselective agonist (1(s), 3(r)]-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid but not by the group i-specific agonist 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine or the group ii-specific agonist [2(s), 1'(r), 2(r), 3'(r)]-2-(2, 3-dicarboxycyclopropyl)glycine. the agonist profile in order of potency was [2(s), 1'(s), 2'(s)]-2-(carboxycyclopropyl)glycine approximately l-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid > glutamate > > [1(s), 3(r)]-1-aminocyclopentane-1, 3-dicarboxylic acid, with ec50 values of 0.63, 0.67, 2.5, and 47 microm, respectively. both the group i/ii-specific antagonist (r,s)-alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine and the group iii-specific antagonist alpha-methyl-amino-phosphonobutyrate inhibited mglur8. the pharmacological profile of mglur8 is distinct among mglurs but closely matches that of presynaptic inhibition in some central nervous system pathways. thus, cellular responses mediated by both group ii and iii agonists may in some cases reflect activation of mglur8 rather than multiple mglur subtypes.
mortality in patients with hiv-1 and tuberculosis co-infection in rio de janeiro, brazil - associated factors and causes of death objective to describe tuberculosis epidemiological situation in brazil, as well as program performance indicators in 2001-2010 period, and discuss the relationship between changes observed and control measures implemented in this century first decade.   methods it is a descriptive study, data source was the information system for notifiable diseases (sinan), mortality information system (sim), unified health system hospital information system (sih/sus) and tb multidrug-resistant surveillance system (mdr-tb/ss). indicators analyzed were organized into four major groups: tb control program (tcp) coverage and case detection; morbidity; treatment and tcp performance; and mortality.   results in the years analyzed there was a decrease in the number of new cases and incidence rate, mortality reduction (relative and absolute), and improvement in tb detection and diagnosis, as well in tb/hiv coinfection and drug resistance. however, little progress was found in contact investigation, diagnosis in primary care and tb cure rate.   discussion results showed many advances in tuberculosis control in the 10 years analyzed, but it also points to serious obstacles that need to be solved so brazil can eliminate tuberculosis as a public health problem.
the evidence on tiotropium bromide in asthma: from the rationale to the bedside despite current guidelines and the range of available treatments, over a half of patients with asthma continue to suffer from poor symptomatic control and remain at risk of future worsening. although a number of non-pharmacological measures are crucial for good clinical management of asthma, new therapeutic controller medications will have a role in the future management of the disease. several long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilators are under investigation or are available for the treatment of respiratory diseases, including tiotropium bromide, aclidinium bromide, glycopyrronium bromide, glycopyrrolate and umeclidinium bromide, although none is yet licensed for the treatment of asthma. a recent phase iii investigation demonstrated that the once-daily long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilator tiotropium bromide improves lung function and reduces the risk of exacerbation in patients with symptomatic asthma, despite the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ics) and long-acting β2-agonists (labas). this has prompted the question of what the rationale is for long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilators in asthma. bronchial smooth muscle contraction is the primary cause of reversible airway narrowing in asthma, and the baseline level of contraction is predominantly set by the level of ‘cholinergic tone’. patients with asthma have increased bronchial smooth muscle tone and mucus hypersecretion, possibly as a result of elevated cholinergic activity, which anticholinergic compounds are known to reduce. further, anticholinergic compounds may also have anti-inflammatory properties. thus, evidence suggests that long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilators might offer benefits for the maintenance of asthma control, such as in patients failing to gain control on ics and a laba, or those with frequent exacerbations.
n‐ and c‐terminal degradation of ecdysteroid receptor isoforms, when transiently expressed in mammalian cho cells, is regulated by the proteasome and cysteine and threonine proteases backgroundmetamorphosis is a complex, highly conserved and strictly regulated development process that involves the programmed cell death of obsolete larval organs. here we show a novel functional role for the aspartic proteinase cathepsin d during insect metamorphosis.resultscathepsin d of the silkworm bombyx mori (bmcatd) was ecdysone-induced, differentially and spatially expressed in the larval fat body of the final instar and in the larval gut of pupal stage, and its expression led to programmed cell death. furthermore, bmcatd was highly induced in the fat body of baculovirus-infected b. mori larvae, suggesting that this gene is involved in the induction of metamorphosis of host insects infected with baculovirus. rna interference (rnai)-mediated bmcatd knock-down inhibited programmed cell death of the larval fat body, resulting in the arrest of larval-pupal transformation. bmcatd rnai also inhibited the programmed cell death of larval gut during pupal stage.conclusionbased on these results, we concluded that bmcatd is critically involved in the programmed cell death of the larval fat body and larval gut in silkworm metamorphosis.
genomic regions influencing seminal root traits in barley grain dormancy provides protection against pre-harvest sprouting (phs) in cereals. composite interval mapping and association analyses were performed to identify quantitative trait loci (qtl) contributing grain dormancy in a doubled haploid (dh) barley population (nd24260 × flagship) consisting of 321 lines genotyped with dart markers. harvest-ripe grain collected from three field experiments was germinated over a 7-day period to determine a weighted germination index for each line. dh lines displaying moderate to high levels of grain dormancy were identified; however, both parental lines were non-dormant and displayed rapid germination within the first two days of testing. genetic analysis identified two qtl on chromosome 5h that were expressed consistently in each of the three environments. one qtl (donated by flagship) was located close to the centromeric region of chromosome 5h (qsdflag), accounting for up to 15% of the phenotypic variation. a second qtl with a larger effect (from nd24260) was detected on chromosome 5hl (qsdnd), accounting for up to 35% of the phenotypic variation. qsdflag and qsdnd displayed an epistatic interaction and dh lines that had the highest levels of grain dormancy carried both genes. we demonstrate that qsdnd in the nd24260 × flagship dh population is positioned proximal and independent to the well-characterised sd2 region that is associated with both high levels of dormancy and inferior malt quality. this indicates that it should be possible to develop cultivars that combine acceptable malting quality and adequate levels of grain dormancy for protection against phs by utilizing these alternate qtl.
clicking for calamari: toothed whales can echolocate squid loligo pealeii summary toothed whales (odontoceti, cetacea) navigate and locate prey by means of active echolocation. studies on captive animals have accumulated a large body of knowledge concerning the production, reception and processing of sound in odontocete biosonars, but there is little information about the properties and use of biosonar clicks of free-ranging animals in offshore habitats. this study presents the first source parameter estimates of biosonar clicks from two free-ranging oceanic delphinids, the opportunistically foraging pseudorca crassidens and the cephalopod eating grampus griseus. pseudorca produces short duration (30 μs), broadband (q=2–3) signals with peak frequencies around 40 khz, centroid frequencies of 30–70 khz, and source levels between 201–225 db re. 1 μpa (peak to peak, pp). grampus also produces short (40 μs), broadband (q=2–3) signals with peak frequencies around 50 khz, centroid frequencies of 60–90 khz, and source levels between 202 and 222 db re. 1 μpa (pp). on-axis clicks from both species had centroid frequencies in the frequency range of most sensitive hearing, and lower peak frequencies and higher source levels than reported from captive animals. it is demonstrated that sound production in these two free-ranging echolocators is dynamic, and that free-ranging animals may not always employ biosonar signals comparable to the extreme signal properties reported from captive animals in long-range detection tasks. similarities in source parameters suggest that evolutionary factors other than prey type determine the properties of biosonar signals of the two species. modelling shows that interspecific detection ranges of prey types differ from 80 to 300 m for grampus and pseudorca, respectively.
macular pigment density changes in japanese individuals supplemented with lutein or zeaxanthin: quantification via resonance raman spectrophotometry and autofluorescence imaging age-related macular degeneration (amd) is thought to be the result of a lifetime of oxidative insult that results in photoreceptor death within the macula. increased risk of amd may result from low levels of lutein and zeaxanthin (macular pigment) in the diet, serum or retina, and excessive exposure to blue light. through its light-screening capacity and antioxidant activity, macular pigment may reduce photooxidation in the central retina. lutein supplements, at 30 mg/d, were shown previously to increase serum lutein and macular pigment density in two subjects. in this study, we compared the effects of a range of lutein doses (2.4- 30 mg/d), as well as a high zeaxanthin dose (30 mg/d), on the serum and macular pigment in a series of experiments. serum carotenoids were quantified by hplc. macular pigment densities were determined psychophysically. serum lutein concentrations in each subject reached a plateau that was correlated with the dose (r = 0.82, p < 0.001). plateau concentrations ranged from 2.8 x 10(-7) to 2.7 x 10(-6) mol/l. zeaxanthin was less well absorbed than an equal lutein dose, resulting in plateaus of approximately 5 x 10(-7) mol/l. the rate of increase in macular pigment optical density was correlated with the plateau concentration of carotenoids in the serum (r = 0.58, p < 0.001), but not with the presupplementation optical density (r = 0.13, p = 0.21). the mean rate of increase was (3.42 +/- 0.80) x 10(5) mau/d per unit concentration (mol/l) of carotenoids in the serum. it remains to be demonstrated whether lutein or zeaxanthin dietary supplements reduce the incidence of amd.
predicting therapeutic response in patients with heart failure: the story of c-reactive protein the circulating acute phase reactant c-reactive protein (crp) has traditionally been characterized as an effector of nonclonal host resistance since it activates the classical complement cascade and mediates phagocytosis, but it is also capable of regulating inflammation. the three-dimensional structure of human crp has revealed the molecular basis for complement activation and binding of phosphate monoesters. crp gene expression by liver hepatocytes in response to cytokines (il-1β and il-6) released in tissues requires several transcription factors which interact. elevated levels of crp are a prognostic marker for coronary artery disease; however, the role of crp in atheriosclerosis remains unknown. crp also mediates direct host protection to some microbial pathogens via its opsonic activity through certain fcγ-receptors. the crp response may be one of the links between nonspecific innate immunity and specific clonal immunity.
bcl-2 antisense (g3139, genasense) enhances the in vitro and in vivo response of epstein-barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative disease to rituximab. posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disease (ptld) is virtually always associated with epstein-barr virus (ebv) infection. bcl-2 and other proteins that confer resistance to apoptosis have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of malignancies including lymphomas. one ebv protein, bhrf1, is a homologue of bcl-2, whereas another, the latency membrane protein 1 (lmp-1), upregulates bcl-2 expression in vitro. in the present study, we used immunohistochemistry to study the expression of these viral and cellular proteins as well as a variety of other ebv-encoded proteins in ptld. bhrf1 was not detected in any ptld specimen, whereas bcl-2 was shown in 12 of 17 lesions examined. with one exception, all lmp1-positive cases also expressed bcl-2 and the absence of lmp1 was always associated with a lack of bcl-2 expression. the results do not support a role for the ebv homologue of bcl-2 in ptld, but they do support a role for viral induction of bcl-2 expression.
shedding of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 induced by protein a decreases tumor necrosis factor alpha availability and inflammation during systemic staphylococcus aureus infection tace trafficking the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (tnf) is a major driver of inflammation and contributes to the immune pathology seen in a variety of diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and sepsis. soluble tnf is produced by cleavage of its ectodomain by the adam family metalloprotease, tnfα-converting enzyme (tace). however, the molecular regulation of tace is not understood (see the perspective by lichtenthaler). adrain et al. (p. 225) and mcilwain et al. (p. 229) now show that the rhomboid family member irhom2 interacts with tace in macrophages and is required for its proper intracellular trafficking and activation. in the absence of irhom2, tace was not released from the endoplasmic reticulum, and active protease did not reach the cell surface. because of an inability to produce tnf, irhom2-deficient mice were more resistant to lipopolysaccharide-induced septic shock but could not adequately control a listeria monocytogenes infection. a pseudoprotease is required for the proteolytic cleavage of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor. innate immune responses are vital for pathogen defense but can result in septic shock when excessive. a key mediator of septic shock is tumor necrosis factor–α (tnfα), which is shed from the plasma membrane after cleavage by the tnfα convertase (tace). we report that the rhomboid family member irhom2 interacted with tace and regulated tnfα shedding. irhom2 was critical for tace maturation and trafficking to the cell surface in hematopoietic cells. gene-targeted irhom2-deficient mice showed reduced serum tnfα in response to lipopolysaccharide (lps) and could survive a lethal lps dose. furthermore, irhom2-deficient mice failed to control the replication of listeria monocytogenes. our study has identified irhom2 as a regulator of innate immunity that may be an important target for modulating sepsis and pathogen defense.
inborn errors of metabolism and the human interactome: a systems medicine approach given the functional interdependencies between the molecular components in a human cell, a disease is rarely a consequence of an abnormality in a single gene, but reflects the perturbations of the complex intracellular and intercellular network that links tissue and organ systems. the emerging tools of network medicine offer a platform to explore systematically not only the molecular complexity of a particular disease, leading to the identification of disease modules and pathways, but also the molecular relationships among apparently distinct (patho)phenotypes. advances in this direction are essential for identifying new disease genes, for uncovering the biological significance of disease-associated mutations identified by genome-wide association studies and full-genome sequencing, and for identifying drug targets and biomarkers for complex diseases.
econometrics and operational research efficient portfolio selection in a large market in portfolio analysis, uncertainty about parameter values leads to suboptimal portfolio choices. the resulting loss in the investor's utility is a function of the particular estimator chosen for expected returns. so, this is a problem of simultaneous estimation of normal means under a well-specified loss function. in this situation, as stein has shown, the classical sample mean is inadmissible. this paper presents a simple empirical bayes estimator that should outperform the sample mean in the context of a portfolio. simulation analysis shows that these bayes-stein estimators provide significant gains in portfolio selection problems.
proteomic response of the biological control fungus trichoderma atroviride to growth on the cell walls of rhizoctonia solani abstract chitinolytic and glucanolytic fungal cell wall-degrading enzymes have been suggested to be primary determinants of biocontrol bytrichoderma spp. we examined the effects of ammonium, glucose, chitin, and chito-oligomers on transcription of specific genes and secretion of fungal cell wall-degrading enzymes. the genesech42, nag1, andgluc78 were examined, as were the enzymes they encode (endochitinase chit42, n-acetylhexosaminidase chit73, and glucan exo-1,3-β-glucanase gluc78, respectively).gluc78 could be induced by nitrogen starvation alone, while both ech42 and nag1 required nitrogen starvation and the presence of chitin for induction. starvation for both ammonium and glucose resulted in very early expression and secretion of all cell wall-degrading enzymes examined. in the presence of low levels of ammonium (10 mm), both chito-oligomers and chitin triggered chit42 and chit40 (chitobiosidase) production. chit73 secretion occurred in the presence ofn-acetylglucosamine and chito-oligomers, while chitin was less effective. the presence of different chito-oligomers resulted in secretion of specific n-acetylhexosaminidases, of which chit73 is one. our results indicate that the expression and secretion of cell wall-degrading enzymes is nitrogen repressed, that effects of carbon and nitrogen nutrition are interactive, and that especially for chitinolytic enzymes, the inductive effect of chitin is altered by the level of ammonium or glucose in the medium.
picaro - a block cipher allowing efficient higher-order side-channel resistance random delays are often inserted in embedded software to protect against side-channel and fault attacks. at ches 2009 a new method for generation of random delays was described that increases the attacker's uncertainty about the position of sensitive operations. in this paper we show that the ches 2009 method is less secure than claimed. we describe an improved method for random delay generation which does not suffer from the same security weakness. we also show that the paper's criterion to measure the security of random delays can be misleading, so we introduce a new criterion for random delays which is directly connected to the number of acquisitions required to break an implementation. we mount a power analysis attack against an 8-bit implementation of the improved method verifying its higher security in practice.
the inability of bacillus licheniformis perr mutant to grow is mainly due to the lack of perr-mediated fur repression perr is a ferric uptake repressor (fur) homolog that functions as the central regulator of the inducible peroxide stress response in bacillus subtilis. perr has been previously demonstrated to regulate the mrga, kata, ahpcf, hemaxcdbl, and zosa genes. we now demonstrate that perr also mediates both the repression of its own gene and that of fur. whereas perr-mediated repression of most target genes can be elicited by either manganese or iron, repression of perr and fur is selective for manganese. genetic studies indicate that repression of perr regulon genes by either manganese or iron requires perr and is generally independent of fur. indeed, in a fur mutant, iron-mediated repression is enhanced. unexpectedly, repression of the fur gene by manganese appears to require both perr and fur, but only perr binds to the fur regulatory region in vitro. the fur mutation appears to act indirectly by affecting cellular metal ion pools and thereby affecting perr-mediated repression. while many components of the perr regulon are strongly induced by hydrogen peroxide, little, if any, induction of fur and perr could be demonstrated. thus, not all components of the perr regulon are components of the peroxide stimulon. we suggest that perr exists in distinct metallated forms that differ in dna target selectivity and in sensitivity to oxidation. this model is supported by the observation that the metal ion composition of the growth medium can greatly influence the transcriptional response of the various perr regulon genes to hydrogen peroxide.
the krebs cycle enzyme α-ketoglutarate decarboxylase is an essential glycosomal protein in bloodstream african trypanosomes abstract the dihydrolipoyl succinyltransferase (e2) of the multisubunit α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (α-kd) is an essential krebs cycle enzyme commonly found in the matrices of mitochondria. african trypanosomes developmentally regulate mitochondrial carbohydrate metabolism and lack a functional krebs cycle in the bloodstream of mammals. we found that despite the absence of a functional α-kd, bloodstream form (bf) trypanosomes express α-kde2, which localized to the mitochondrial matrix and inner membrane. furthermore, α-kde2 fractionated with the mitochondrial genome, the kinetoplast dna (kdna), in a complex with the flagellum. a role for α-kde2 in kdna maintenance was revealed in α-kde2 rna interference (rnai) knockdowns. following rnai induction, bloodstream trypanosomes showed pronounced growth reduction and often failed to equally distribute kdna to daughter cells, resulting in accumulation of cells devoid of kdna (dyskinetoplastic) or containing two kinetoplasts. dyskinetoplastic trypanosomes lacked mitochondrial membrane potential and contained mitochondria of substantially reduced volume. these results indicate that α-kde2 is bifunctional, both as a metabolic enzyme and as a mitochondrial inheritance factor necessary for the distribution of kdna networks to daughter cells at cytokinesis.
coexistence of multiple genotypes of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus with novel mutant s genes in the hubei province of china in 2016 abstract receptor recognition by viruses is the first and essential step of viral infections of host cells. it is an important determinant of viral host range and cross-species infection and a primary target for antiviral intervention. coronaviruses recognize a variety of host receptors, infect many hosts, and are health threats to humans and animals. the receptor-binding s1 subunit of coronavirus spike proteins contains two distinctive domains, the n-terminal domain (s1-ntd) and the c-terminal domain (s1-ctd), both of which can function as receptor-binding domains (rbds). s1-ntds and s1-ctds from three major coronavirus genera recognize at least four protein receptors and three sugar receptors and demonstrate a complex receptor recognition pattern. for example, highly similar coronavirus s1-ctds within the same genus can recognize different receptors, whereas very different coronavirus s1-ctds from different genera can recognize the same receptor. moreover, coronavirus s1-ntds can recognize either protein or sugar receptors. structural studies in the past decade have elucidated many of the puzzles associated with coronavirus-receptor interactions. this article reviews the latest knowledge on the receptor recognition mechanisms of coronaviruses and discusses how coronaviruses have evolved their complex receptor recognition pattern. it also summarizes important principles that govern receptor recognition by viruses in general.
association between hematologic and inflammatory markers and 31 thrombotic and hemorrhagic events in berlin heart excor patients background cerebrovascular events (cves) are common among children supported with the berlin excor (berlin heart gmbh, berlin, germany) ventricular assist device (vad). given the high incidence of cves associated with this device, we sought to describe our institutional experience in incrementally reducing cves in children supported with the berlin excor vad.   methods we collected pertinent data on 39 consecutive patients who underwent berlin excor vad implantation at a single center. frequency of cves was described in risk per implantation, per day, and in reference to the time of therapeutic anticoagulation. risk factors were analyzed for association with cves.   results of the initial 39 berlin excor vad implantations, 16 cves occurred in 12 patients. the incidence of cves decreased with institutional experience per patient (r(2) = 0.6909, p = 0.007) and per patient-day (r(2) = 0.8051, p = 0.002). cves occurred more frequently before therapeutic anticoagulation targets were achieved (4.1%/day) compared with after therapeutic anticoagulation targets were achieved (0.9%/day; p = 0.044).   conclusions incidence of cves decreased with institutional experience. the risk of cve is highest in the immediate postoperative period before therapeutic anticoagulation is achieved. further studies are warranted in pediatric patients supported with the berlin excor vad to confirm our findings in a larger cohort.
do eportfolios contribute to learners’ reflective thinking activities? : a preliminary study of nursing staff users an information-exchange virtual community (vc) is an it-supported virtual space that is composed of a group of people for accessing, sharing and disseminating topic-related experiences and knowledge through communication and social interaction 36,43]. with the increasing number of vcs and low switching cost, it is challenging to retain existing users and encourage their continued participation. by integrating the is post-adoption research and is success model, we propose a research framework to investigate vc users' continuance intention from a quality perspective. based on a field survey, we find that information and system quality directly affect perceived individual benefits and user satisfaction, which ultimately determine user continuance intention to consume and to provide information. furthermore, by modeling information quality and system quality as multifaceted constructs, our results reveal key quality concerns in information-exchange vcs. implications for vc design and management are also discussed.
the 1st international workshop on diversity in document retrieval when a web user's underlying information need is not clearly specified from the initial query, an effective approach is to diversify the results retrieved for this query. in this paper, we introduce a novel probabilistic framework for web search result diversification, which explicitly accounts for the various aspects associated to an underspecified query. in particular, we diversify a document ranking by estimating how well a given document satisfies each uncovered aspect and the extent to which different aspects are satisfied by the ranking as a whole. we thoroughly evaluate our framework in the context of the diversity task of the trec 2009 web track. moreover, we exploit query reformulations provided by three major web search engines (wses) as a means to uncover different query aspects. the results attest the effectiveness of our framework when compared to state-of-the-art diversification approaches in the literature. additionally, by simulating an upper-bound query reformulation mechanism from official trec data, we draw useful insights regarding the effectiveness of the query reformulations generated by the different wses in promoting diversity.
thioridazine and chlorpromazine inhibition of ethidium bromide efflux in mycobacterium avium and mycobacterium smegmatis. the genus mycobacterium contains two of the most important human pathogens, mycobacterium tuberculosis and mycobacterium leprae, the etiologic agents of tuberculosis and leprosy, respectively. other mycobacteria are mostly saprophytic organisms, living in soil and water, but some of them can cause opportunistic infections. the increasing incidence of tuberculosis as well as infections with non-tuberculous mycobacteria (ntm) in aids patients has renewed interest in molecular mechanisms of drug resistance in these pathogens. mycobacteria show a high degree of intrinsic resistance to most common antibiotics. for instance, species from the m. tuberculosis complex (mtc) are intrinsically resistant to macrolides. nevertheless, some semi-synthetic macrolides as the erythromycin derivatives clarithromycin, azithromycin and most recently the ketolides, are active against ntm, particularly mycobacterium avium, and some of them are widely used for infection treatment. however, shortly after the introduction of these new drugs, resistant strains appeared due to mutations in the macrolide target, the ribosome. the mycobacterial cell wall with its specific composition and structure is considered to be a major factor in promoting the natural resistance of mycobacteria to various antibiotics. however, to explain the difference in macrolide sensitivity between the mtc and ntm, the synergistic contribution of a specific resistance mechanism might be required, in addition to possible differences in cell wall permeability. this mini-review summarizes the current knowledge on the natural and acquired macrolide resistance in mycobacteria, gives an overview of potential mechanisms implicated in the intrinsic resistance and brings recent data concerning a macrolide resistance determinant in the mtc.
ataxin-3 protein modification as a treatment strategy for spinocerebellar ataxia type 3: removal of the cag containing exon summary background we report clinical safety and biochemical efficacy from a dose-ranging study of intravenously administered avi-4658 phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (pmo) in patients with duchenne muscular dystrophy. method we undertook an open-label, phase 2, dose-escalation study (0·5, 1·0, 2·0, 4·0, 10·0, and 20·0 mg/kg bodyweight) in ambulant patients with duchenne muscular dystrophy aged 5–15 years with amenable deletions in dmd. participants had a muscle biopsy before starting treatment and after 12 weekly intravenous infusions of avi-4658. the primary study objective was to assess safety and tolerability of avi-4658. the secondary objectives were pharmacokinetic properties and the ability of avi-4658 to induce exon 51 skipping and dystrophin restoration by rt-pcr, immunohistochemistry, and immunoblotting. the study is registered, number nct00844597. findings 19 patients took part in the study. avi-4658 was well tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events. avi-4658 induced exon 51 skipping in all cohorts and new dystrophin protein expression in a significant dose-dependent (p=0·0203), but variable, manner in boys from cohort 3 (dose 2 mg/kg) onwards. seven patients responded to treatment, in whom mean dystrophin fluorescence intensity increased from 8·9% (95% ci 7·1–10·6) to 16·4% (10·8–22·0) of normal control after treatment (p=0·0287). the three patients with the greatest responses to treatment had 21%, 15%, and 55% dystrophin-positive fibres after treatment and these findings were confirmed with western blot, which showed an increase after treatment of protein levels from 2% to 18%, from 0·9% to 17%, and from 0% to 7·7% of normal muscle, respectively. the dystrophin-associated proteins α-sarcoglycan and neuronal nitric oxide synthase were also restored at the sarcolemma. analysis of the inflammatory infiltrate indicated a reduction of cytotoxic t cells in the post-treatment muscle biopsies in the two high-dose cohorts. interpretation the safety and biochemical efficacy that we present show the potential of avi-4658 to become a disease-modifying drug for duchenne muscular dystrophy. funding uk medical research council; avi biopharma.
the her2-mir125a5p/mir125b loop in gastric and esophageal carcinogenesis. background trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2; also known as erbb2), was investigated in combination with chemotherapy for first-line treatment of her2-positive advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer.   methods toga (trastuzumab for gastric cancer) was an open-label, international, phase 3, randomised controlled trial undertaken in 122 centres in 24 countries. patients with gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer were eligible for inclusion if their tumours showed overexpression of her2 protein by immunohistochemistry or gene amplification by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation. participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive a chemotherapy regimen consisting of capecitabine plus cisplatin or fluorouracil plus cisplatin given every 3 weeks for six cycles or chemotherapy in combination with intravenous trastuzumab. allocation was by block randomisation stratified by eastern cooperative oncology group performance status, chemotherapy regimen, extent of disease, primary cancer site, and measurability of disease, implemented with a central interactive voice recognition system. the primary endpoint was overall survival in all randomised patients who received study medication at least once. this trial is registered with clinicaltrials.gov, number nct01041404.   findings 594 patients were randomly assigned to study treatment (trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, n=298; chemotherapy alone, n=296), of whom 584 were included in the primary analysis (n=294; n=290). median follow-up was 18.6 months (iqr 11-25) in the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy group and 17.1 months (9-25) in the chemotherapy alone group. median overall survival was 13.8 months (95% ci 12-16) in those assigned to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy compared with 11.1 months (10-13) in those assigned to chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio 0.74; 95% ci 0.60-0.91; p=0.0046). the most common adverse events in both groups were nausea (trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, 197 [67%] vs chemotherapy alone, 184 [63%]), vomiting (147 [50%] vs 134 [46%]), and neutropenia (157 [53%] vs 165 [57%]). rates of overall grade 3 or 4 adverse events (201 [68%] vs 198 [68%]) and cardiac adverse events (17 [6%] vs 18 [6%]) did not differ between groups.   interpretation trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy can be considered as a new standard option for patients with her2-positive advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer.   funding f hoffmann-la roche.
aerosol composition and sources in the central arctic ocean during ascos increases in anthropogenic aerosols in the atmosphere tend to increase the reflectance of solar (shortwave) radiation from water clouds, which can lead to lower surface temperatures. here an opposing effect whereby aerosols increase the longwave emissivity of thin clouds that adds to the warming of the earth’s surface, is discussed. the latter effect may be particularly important in the arctic, especially during the winter and early spring when thin stratus clouds are ubiquitous, relatively high levels of anthropogenic pollution are common, and there is little solar radiation.
retracted: fmn2 makes perinuclear actin to protect nuclei during conﬁned migration and promote metastasis the actin cytoskeleton is essential for diverse processes in mammalian cells; these processes range from establishing cell polarity to powering cell migration to driving cytokinesis to positioning intracellular organelles. how these many functions are carried out in a spatiotemporally regulated manner in a single cytoplasm has been the subject of much study in the cytoskeleton field. recent work has identified a host of actin nucleation factors that can build architecturally diverse actin structures. the biochemical properties of these factors, coupled with their cellular location, likely define the functional properties of actin structures. in this article, we describe how recent advances in cell biology and biochemistry have begun to elucidate the role of individual actin nucleation factors in generating distinct cellular structures. we also consider how the localization and orientation of actin nucleation factors, in addition to their kinetic properties, are critical to their ability to build a functional actin cytoskeleton.
a general method to solve complex problems by combining multiple answer set programs we first introduce abstract dpll, a rule-based formulation of the davis--putnam--logemann--loveland (dpll) procedure for propositional satisfiability. this abstract framework allows one to cleanly express practical dpll algorithms and to formally reason about them in a simple way. its properties, such as soundness, completeness or termination, immediately carry over to the modern dpll implementations with features such as backjumping or clause learning.we then extend the framework to satisfiability modulo background theories (smt) and use it to model several variants of the so-called lazy approach for smt. in particular, we use it to introduce a few variants of a new, efficient and modular approach for smt based on a general dpll(x) engine, whose parameter x can be instantiated with a specialized solver solvert for a given theory t, thus producing a dpll(t) system. we describe the high-level design of dpll(x) and its cooperation with solvert, discuss the role of theory propagation, and describe different dpll(t) strategies for some theories arising in industrial applications.our extensive experimental evidence, summarized in this article, shows that dpll(t) systems can significantly outperform the other state-of-the-art tools, frequently even in orders of magnitude, and have better scaling properties.
shiga toxin and beta-lactamases genes in escherichia coli phylotypes isolated from carcasses of broiler chickens slaughtered in iran. the relationship between human diseases caused by infection with shiga toxin (stx)-producing escherichia coli (stec) o157 strains and o157 strains isolated from cattle was investigated in an area where stockbreeding is prolific. for this purpose, the stx genotypes, the molecular epidemiological characteristics of 268 stec o157 strains including 211 human-origin strains and 57 cattle-origin strains, and clinical manifestations of 210 stec-infected people were analyzed. of 211 human-origin strains, 92 strains (44%) were of the stx1/stx2 genotype, and 74 strains (35%) were of the stx2c genotype. most of the people infected with stx2c genotype strains presented no symptoms or mild symptoms such as slight diarrhea, except for 3 patients with bloody diarrhea. of the 57 cattle-origin strains, 27 strains (47%) were of the stx2c genotype and 17 strains (30%) were of the stx1/stx2 genotype. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and insertion sequence (is) analysis demonstrated that 11 isolates (41%) of the 27 cattle isolates of the stx2c genotype had high homology (>95% identity) with human isolates. these results suggest that some genetic patterns of the stx2c genotype strains might be preserved in cattle or their surrounding environment for several years, and during these periods, they might have opportunities to infect people through various routes. because of the mild virulence of the stx2c genotype strains, they seemed to be transmitted asymptomatically from cattle to humans and then spread from person to person. it may be a public health concern. further, they occasionally cause severe symptoms in humans; therefore, caution is warranted for infections by stx2c genotype o157 strains, in addition to stx2-possessing genotype o157 strains.
prediction of ovarian cancer prognosis and response to chemotherapy by a serum-based multiparametric biomarker panel epithelial ovarian cancer constitutes one-quarter of the gynecologic malignancies, but is the leading cause of death among women with gynecologic cancer. in 6070% of the women, the disease is detected at a late stage when 5-year survival is poor. the recommended primary therapeutic approach for ovarian cancer is aggressive primarydebulking surgery followed by combination chemotherapy. the efficacy is routinely evaluated by repeated vaginal examination and transabdominal ultrasonography. however, these methods are unreliable for monitoring as progressive and recurrent disease often remains hidden until the patient presents with a large tumor mass. over the last few decades a variety of serological tumor markers has been proposed as a supplement to other non-invasive diagnostic methods. the main issue with tumor marker measurements is to obtain reliable information about changes in tumor mass before the changes are detectable by other methods. however, despite several attempts to identify useful serological markers for epithelial ovarian cancer, the results have not been as encouraging as for germ-cell tumors. the purpose of this paper is to review the applicability of ca 125, cea, tpa, tati, casa, and tetranectin in screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of ovarian carcinoma. several compounds other than those mentioned above are being investigated as markers in the early detection and management of ovarian cancer. some ofthese potential tumor markers listed in table 1 will not be discussed further in this review.
the in vivo dynamic fatigue response of the spine to sudden loading in the sagittal plane: effects of pre-load and step input magnitude. objective to evaluate the impact of muscle pre-activation levels and load magnitude on the response of the trunk to loading conditions causing rapid flexion.   design eight male subjects were asked to maintain an upright standing posture while resisting the application of forward flexion moments produced by four different loading conditions consisting of combinations of two pre-loads (4% or 16% of the maximum extensor moment) and two added loads (12% or 24%). pre-loading was used to develop different initial levels of trunk muscle activity prior to the application of the added loads. of special interest were the two conditions that resulted in total final loads of 28%.   background cocontraction of the antagonistic and agonistic muscles of the trunk are required to provide stability during normal physiological loading conditions. in several in vivo studies, levels of trunk muscle cocontraction have been observed prior to the application of unexpected or sudden loads. forces from the abdominal muscles have been proposed to provide stability when extensor moments are generated. the response of trunk muscles to rapid flexor moments would provide further insight into the dynamic stability mechanisms of the spine.   methods measurements were made of the trunk extensor moments, angular displacement of the trunk and unilateral surface emg amplitudes of three abdominal and three trunk extensor muscles. values were recorded during the isometric pre-load and for the maximum magnitude of each variable in response to the added load.   results higher pre-loads resulted in lower flexion rotations of the spine and higher added loads caused larger rotations. with increasing magnitudes of final loads, a corresponding increase in trunk extensor moments and trunk muscle cocontraction was observed. the largest activations were observed in the lumbar erector spinae and thoracic erector spinae muscles, while smaller yet substantial emg activity was observed in the internal oblique and external oblique. a comparison of the 28% loading conditions showed an increased response of the trunk to the [4 + 24] loading condition (with lower initial trunk stiffness) when compared to the [16 + 12] loading condition.   conclusions pre-activation of trunk extensor muscles can serve to reduce the flexion displacements caused by rapid loading. the abdominal oblique muscles, especially external oblique, will rapidly increase their activation levels in response to rapid loading. these changes are more pronounced when pre-activation levels are low, resulting in lower initial trunk stiffness and spine compression force. it is proposed that these factors will ultimately affect spine stability and the risk of injury.   relevance the results of this study provide insight into several mechanisms involved in the dynamic stability of the spine. injuries can be caused by unexpected and rapid loading of the spine. a study of the mechanisms available to respond to such perturbations is important to an understanding of spine mechanics and the etiology of low back injury.
tendon fascicles exhibit a linear correlation between poisson's ratio and force during uniaxial stress relaxation. a transversely isotropic biphasic mixture model was applied to tendon in uniaxial tension. parametric analyses were performed and the sensitivity in predicting material parameters was evaluated. our results provide quantitative evidence for fluid flow as a mechanism that contributes to tendon viscoelasticity. transversely isotropic material properties were calculated for mouse tail tendon fascicles. the average transverse modulus (e(1)) was 0.046 mpa, the fiber-aligned poisson's ratio (v(31)) was 2.73, and the transverse poisson's ratio [(v(21)) was 0.96; these properties were not strain-dependent. the fiber-aligned modulus (e(s)) was strain-dependent and was 20.7 mpa in the toe region and 86.1 mpa in the linear region. these solid matrix properties were consistent with previously published tendon tissue and fascicle data. the fascicle permeability was strain-dependent and was 5.5 x 10(-18)m(4)/ns in the toe region and 0.32 x 10(-18)m(4)/ns in the linear region, similar to previously reported meniscus permeability in tension. the similar permeabilities of both fascicle and tissue-level samples suggest that fluid flow from individual fascicles, not the packing of multiple fascicles together, may be the primary barrier to fluid flow in tendon and thus the primary mechanism for viscoelasticity.
comprehensive study of cd compensation and carrier phase estimation in optical communication systems influenced by equalization enhanced phase noise we demonstrate unrepeated 200-km transmission of 40-gbit/s 16-qam signals using a digital coherent receiver, where the decision-directed carrier-phase estimation is employed. the phase fluctuation is effectively eliminated in the 16-qam system with such a phase-estimation method, when the linewidth of semiconductor lasers for the transmitter and the local oscillator is 150 khz. finite-impulse-response (fir) filters at the receiver compensate for 4,000-ps/nm group-velocity dispersion (gvd) of the 200-km-long single-mode fiber and a part of self-phase modulation (spm) in the digital domain. in spite of the launched power limitation due to spm, the acceptable bit-error rate performance is obtained owing to high sensitivity of the digital coherent receiver.
effective attack models for shilling item-based collaborative filtering systems web usage mining has recently attracted attention as a viable framework for extracting useful access pattern information, such as user profiles, from massive amounts of web log data for the purpose of web site personalization and organization. these efforts have relied mainly on clustering or association rule discovery as the enabling data mining technologies. typically, data mining has to be completely re-applied periodically and offline on newly generated web server logs in order to keep the discovered knowledge up to date. in addition to difficulty to scale and adapt in the face of large data and continuously evolving patterns, most clustering techniques, such as the majority of kmeans variants, also suffer from one or more of the following limitations: requirement of the specification of the correct number of clusters/profiles in advance, sensitivity to initialization, sensitivity to the presence of noise and outliers in the data, and unsuitability for sparse data sets. hence, there is a crucial need for scalable, noise insensitive, initialization independent techniques that can continuously discover possibly evolving web user profiles without any stoppages or reconfigurations. in this paper, we propose a new scalable clustering methodology that gleams inspiration from the natural immune system to be able to continuously learn and adapt to new incoming patterns. the web server plays the role of the human body, and the incoming requests play the role of foreign antigens/bacteria/viruses that need to be detected by the proposed immune based clustering technique. hence, our clustering algorithm plays the role of the cognitive agent of an artificial immune system, whose goal is to continuously perform an intelligent organization of the incoming noisy data into clusters. our approach exhibits superior learning abilities, while at the same time, requiring modest memory and computational costs. like the natural immune system, the strongest advantage of immune based learning compared to current approaches is expected to be its ease of adaptation to the dynamic environment that characterizes several applications, particularly in mining data streams. we illustrate the ability of the proposed approach in mining user profiles from web clickstream data in a single pass under different usage trend sequencing scenarios.
bacterial sbp56 identified as a cu-dependent methanethiol oxidase widely distributed in the biosphere abstract. microbial cycling of volatile organic sulfur compounds (voscs), especially dimethyl sulfide (dms) and methanethiol (mt), is intensively studied because these compounds play an important role in the processes of global warming, acid precipitation, and the global sulfur cycle. vosc concentrations in freshwater sediments are low due to the balance between the formation and degradation of these compounds. these reactions occur for the greater part at the oxic/anoxic interphase of sediment and water column. in contrast to marine ecosystems, where dimethylsulfoniopropionate is the main precursor of mt and dms, in freshwater ecosystems, voscs are formed mainly by methylation of sulfide and to a lesser extent from the degradation of s-containing amino acids. one of the major routes for dms and mt formation through sulfide methylation is anaerobic o-demethylation of methoxylated aromatic compounds. inhibition studies have revealed that the major part of the endogenously produced mt and dms is degraded anaerobically by methanogens. the major bacterial groups involved in formation and consumption of voscs are described.
hypocapnia-induced contraction of porcine airway smooth muscle. the effects of changes in airway co2 partial pressure (paco2) and arterial co2 partial pressure (paco2) on lung mechanics were studied in dogs by utilizing unilateral pulmonary artery occlusion and a tracheal divider which allowed separate variation of paco2 and paco2. when paco2 was held at a reasonably normal level, lower than normal paco2 levels resulted in large compliance decreases, alteration of the complete static pressure-volume curves, and increases in resistance. invreases in paco2 to hypercapnic levels did not produce changes. when paco2 was held at a reasonably normal level, changes in paco2 levels were positively and directly related to resistance with small and inconsistent effects on compliance and on complete static pressure-volume curves. a combination of low paco2 and high paco2 produced large increases in resistance, alterations of the static pressure-volume curve, and decreases in compliance. vagotomy during the combined stimulus resulted in only a decrease in resistance without change in lung elastic properties. the results suggest that the mechanical effects of airway hypocapnia and systemic hypercapnia are additive. however, small airways effects of low paco2 appear to be maximal and uninfluenced by the vagally mediated response to paco2 increases.
effect of compression on sensor-fingerprint based camera identification the article explains how photo-response nonuniformity (prnu) of imaging sensors can be used for a variety of important digital forensic tasks, such as device identification, device linking, recovery of processing history, and detection of digital forgeries. the prnu is an intrinsic property of all digital imaging sensors due to slight variations among individual pixels in their ability to convert photons to electrons. consequently, every sensor casts a weak noise-like pattern onto every image it takes. this pattern, which plays the role of a sensor fingerprint, is essentially an unintentional stochastic spread-spectrum watermark that survives processing, such as lossy compression or filtering. this tutorial explains how this fingerprint can be estimated from images taken by the camera and later detected in a given image to establish image origin and integrity. various forensic tasks are formulated as a two-channel hypothesis testing problem approached using the generalized likelihood ratio test. the performance of the introduced forensic methods is briefly illustrated on examples to give the reader a sense of the performance.
targeted molecular imaging of pancreatic cancer with a miniature endoscope patients with pancreatic cancer continue to have a poor prognosis, with a 5-y survival rate of less than 5%. surgery is the only treatment that offers a potential cure. determining resectability is the principal goal of staging in pancreatic cancer patients. our objective was to evaluate the value of combined contrast-enhanced 18f-fdg pet/ct in assessing the resectability of pancreatic cancer and to compare enhanced pet/ct with the performance of pet alone and unenhanced pet/ct. methods: fifty patients (25 women and 25 men; mean age, 64.3 y; range, 39–84 y) with biopsy-proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma underwent enhanced 18f-fdg pet/ct for the evaluation of resectability. criteria for unresectability were distant metastases, peritoneal carcinomatosis, arterial infiltration, or invasion of neighboring organs other than the duodenum. the performance of enhanced pet/ct regarding resectability was compared with that of pet alone and unenhanced pet/ct. histology, intraoperative findings, and follow-up ct with clinical investigations were used as the reference standard. results: according to the reference standard, 27 patients had disease that was not resectable because of distant metastases (n = 17), peritoneal carcinomatosis (n = 5), or local infiltration (n = 5). in the assessment of resectability, pet alone had a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 44%, accuracy of 70%, positive predictive value of 61%, and negative predictive value of 100%; unenhanced pet/ct had respective values of 100%, 56%, 76%, 66%, and 100%; and enhanced pet/ct, 96%, 82%, 88%, 82%, and 96%. in 5 patients, unresectability was missed by all imaging methods and was diagnosed intraoperatively. enhanced pet/ct was significantly superior to pet alone (p = 0.035), and there was a trend for enhanced pet/ct to be superior to unenhanced pet/ct (p = 0.070). conclusion: the use of enhanced pet/ct as a 1-stop-shop imaging protocol for assessing the resectability of pancreatic cancer is feasible and accurate. enhanced pet/ct is significantly superior to pet alone.
early outcome data assessing utility of a post-test genomic counseling framework for the scalable delivery of precision health there has been very limited study of patients with chronic disease receiving potentially actionable genomic based results or the utilization of genetic counselors in the online result delivery process. we conducted a randomized controlled trial on 199 patients with chronic disease each receiving eight personalized and actionable complex disease reports online. primary study aims were to assess the impact of in-person genomic counseling on 1) causal attribution of disease risk, 2) personal awareness of disease risk, and 3) perceived risk of developing a particular disease. of 98 intervention arm participants (mean age = 57.8; 39% female) randomized for in-person genomic counseling, 76 (78%) were seen. in contrast, control arm participants (n = 101; mean age = 58.5; 54% female) were initially not offered genomic counseling as part of the study protocol but were able to access in-person genomic counseling, if they requested it, 3-months post viewing of at least one test report and post-completion of the study-specific follow-up survey. a total of 64 intervention arm and 59 control arm participants completed follow-up survey measures. we found that participants receiving in-person genomic counseling had enhanced objective understanding of the genetic variant risk contribution for multiple complex diseases. genomic counseling was associated with lowered participant causal beliefs in genetic influence across all eight diseases, compared to control participants. our findings also illustrate that for the majority of diseases under study, intervention arm participants believed they knew their genetic risk status better than control arm subjects. disease risk was modified for the majority during genomic counseling, due to the assessment of more comprehensive family history. in conclusion, for patients receiving personalized and actionable genomic results through a web portal, genomic counseling enhanced their objective understanding of the genetic variant risk contribution to multiple common diseases. these results support the development of additional genomic counseling interventions to ensure a high level of patient comprehension and improve patient-centered health outcomes.
rapid and quantitative detection of the microbial spoilage of meat by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and machine learning this article provides a brief introduction to aspects of mass spectrometry (ms) that employ artificial intelligence (ai) and expert system (es) technology. these areas have grown rapidly with the development of computer software and hardware capabilities. in many cases, they have become fundamental parts of modern mass spectrometers.        specific attention is paid to applications that demonstrate how important features of ms are now dependent on ai and ess. the following topics are specifically covered: history, ms data systems, biological applications, artificial neural networks (anns), and optimization techniques.
single-dose oral naproxen for acute postoperative pain: a quantitative systematic review &na; in this paper we consider the validity and power of some commonly used statistics for assessing the degree of homogeneity between trials in a meta‐analysis. we show, using simulated individual patient data typical of that occurring in randomized controlled trials in pain, that the most commonly used statistics do not give the expected levels of statistical significance (i.e. the proportion of trials giving a significant result is not equal to the proportion expected due to random chance) when used with truly homogeneous data. in addition, all such statistics are shown to have extremely low power to detect true heterogeneity even when that heterogeneity is very large. since, in most practical situations, failure to detect heterogeneity does not allow us to say with any helpful degree of certainty that the data is truly homogeneous, we advocate the quantitative combination of results only where the trials contained in a meta‐analysis can be shown to be clinically homogeneous. we propose as a definition of clinical homogeneity that all trials have (i) fixed and clearly defined inclusion criteria and (ii) fixed and clearly defined outcomes or outcome measures. in pain relief, for example, the first of these would be satisfied by all patients having moderate or severe pain, whilst the second would be satisfied by using at least 50% pain relief as the successful outcome measure.
proline-rich cell wall proteins accumulate in growing regions and phloem tissue in response to water deficit in common bean seedlings two antigenically related glycoproteins, called p33 and p36, accumulate in the soluble fraction of the cell wall in response to water deficit in phaseolus vulgaris. in this report, we show that p33 and p36 are able to adhere to leaf protoplasts, and that they bind to plasma membrane (pm) vesicles in a divalent cation-dependent manner. data from the partial amino acid sequence of the p33 and p36 proteins indicate that they contain repeats of the decapeptide povykpovek; therefore, they are related to proline-rich proteins. binding assays demonstrate that both proteins specifically bind to an 80 kda pm protein. this binding is competed with a peptide that contains the rgd motif, as well as with fibronectin, which also includes this sequence, suggesting that the 80 kda pm protein has an integrin-like function whose natural ligands are p33 and p36. this is the first case where a pm ligand for a higher plant cell wall protein has been identified.
neurochemical organization of the turtle pretectum: an immunohistochemical study. comparative analysis the present study was carried out to examine if peptides similar to the various opioid peptide products of mammalian proenkephalin are present in the turtle central nervous system and to determine their distribution. antisera against several enkephalin peptides were used: (1) leucine‐enkephalin (lenk), (2) methionine‐enkephalin (menk), (3) methionine‐enkephalin‐arg6‐phe7 (merf), (4) methionine‐enkephalin‐arg6‐gly7‐leu8 (mergl), (5) peptide e (pepe), and (6) bam22p. their specificity and cross‐reactivity were carefully examined. the results indicated that lenk, menk, and merf (or highly similar peptides) are present in the turtle central nervous system, and that a peptide showing immunological similarity to bam22p and pepe also appeared to be present. in contrast, mergl did not appear to be present. the distributions of the immunoreactive labeling for lenk, menk, merf, bam22p, and pepe were indistinguishable, and double‐label studies showed that lenk, merf, and bam22p were colocalized within individual neurons and fibers. although all of the above substances were observed in the same cell groups, there was some regional variation, in terms of which enkephalin peptide appeared to be most abundant.
assessing potential vulnerability and response of fish to simulated avian predation after exposure to psychotropic pharmaceuticals pharmaceuticals in the environment (pie) are of importance since these compounds are designed to affect biological receptors/enzymes that are often conserved across vertebrate families. across-species extrapolation of these therapeutic targets suggests potential for impacting amphibia and fish in the aquatic environment. due to the scarcity of relevant ecotoxicological data, the long-tem impact of pie remains a research question. efficient use of mammalian data has been proposed to better understand and predict the potential for a given pharmaceutical to impact the environment. using a model cardiovascular pharmaceutical (propranolol, a non-specific beta(1)/beta(2)-adrenergic antagonist), the hypothesis that mammalian data can be used to predict toxicity in fish was tested. rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss (walbaum)) have beta-adrenergic signalling mechanisms analogous to human cardiovascular receptors that respond to pharmacological doses of agonists and antagonists. trout absorbed propranolol from water such that after 40 days of exposure, the linear relationship was [plasma] - 0.59[water] (n - 31, r - 0.96). growth rate was affected only at very high aqueous concentrations (10-day (growth)noec - 1.0 and (growth)loec - 10 mg/l). growth recovered with time (40-day (growth)noec - 10 mg/l), suggesting possible adaptation to the pharmaceutical, although the internal plasma concentration in trout exposed to 10mg propranolol/l of water was higher than the mammalian therapeutic plasma concentration. additional endpoints suggested subtle changes of liver and heart size at much lower concentrations may have occurred, although these were not concentration-related. there was, however, a dose-dependent effect upon overall body condition. the trout plasma concentrations at these effective aqueous concentrations fell within the range of mammalian effective plasma concentrations, supporting the potential for developing 'read-across' from mammalian pharmacology safety data to fish ecotoxicology. despite these effects at relatively high concentrations, propranolol is not expected to pose a risk to fish at the concentrations considered to be present in the aquatic environment.
efficacy and safety of a new botulinum toxin type a free of complexing proteins in 2005, incobotulinumtoxina (xeomin®), a new botulinum toxin (bt) type a drug without complexing proteins (cps), became available. this paper reviews the specific features of xeomin® and the experience gathered with it during the last 5 years. compared with conventional bt drugs, xeomin®’s extended shelf live and its simplified temperature restrictions indicate that cps are not necessary for bt drug stability. its reduced molecular size does not translate into diffusion differences, and its potency labelling is identical to that of onabotulinumtoxina (botox®). with a reduced content of inactivated botulinum neurotoxin, xeomin® should have reduced antigenicity. lack of cp’s may further reduce antigenicity. xeomin®’s therapeutic efficacy against cervical dystonia, blepharospasm and spasticity has been proven in large randomised, double‐blind and placebo‐controlled studies leading to registrations in many countries. additional successful clinical use in axillary hyperhidrosis, hemifacial spasm, re‐innervation synkinesias and hypersalivation as well as in dystonia and spasticity in extended doses and throughout extended observation periods has been documented meanwhile. lack of reported cases of antibody‐induced therapy failure (abf), as to date, support the hypothesis of an improved antigenicity.
concomitant production of detergent compatible enzymes by bacillus flexus xju-1 abstract lipases, triacylglycerol hydrolases, are an important group of biotechnologically relevant enzymes and they find immense applications in food, dairy, detergent and pharmaceutical industries. lipases are by and large produced from microbes and specifically bacterial lipases play a vital role in commercial ventures. some important lipase-producing bacterial genera include bacillus, pseudomonas and burkholderia. lipases are generally produced on lipidic carbon, such as oils, fatty acids, glycerol or tweens in the presence of an organic nitrogen source. bacterial lipases are mostly extracellular and are produced by submerged fermentation. the enzyme is most commonly purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography, in addition to some modern approaches such as reverse micellar and aqueous two-phase systems. most lipases can act in a wide range of ph and temperature, though alkaline bacterial lipases are more common. lipases are serine hydrolases and have high stability in organic solvents. besides these, some lipases exhibit chemo-, regio- and enantioselectivity. the latest trend in lipase research is the development of novel and improved lipases through molecular approaches such as directed evolution and exploring natural communities by the metagenomic approach.
contribution of 5‐ht to locomotion – the paradox of pet‐1−/− mice in vivo and in vitro experiments were performed in control (c3h) and monoamine oxidase a (maoa)-deficient (tg8) neonatal mice to determine whether maoa deficiency affected spinal locomotor network maturation. comparing the swimming behaviors at birth in c3h mice with those in tg8 mice revealed a delayed role for the hindlimbs in tg8 swimming, even though adult swimming behavior was acquired at postnatal day 14 (p14) in both strains. analyzing the locomotor network activity in vitro showed that serotonin (5-ht) induced and modulated locomotor-like discharges in hindlimb ventral roots of c3h but not tg8 neonates. the tg8 network began, however, to be affected by 5-ht at p11. thus both in vivo and in vitro results argue for a transient delay of locomotor network maturation in the tg8 strain.
scp160p is required for translational efficiency of codon-optimized mrnas in yeast the yeast spindle pole body (spb), the functional equivalent of mammalian centrosome, duplicates in g1/s phase of the cell cycle and then becomes inserted into the nuclear envelope. here we describe a link between spb duplication and targeted translation control. when insertion of the newly formed spb into the nuclear envelope fails, the sesa network comprising the gyf domain protein smy2, the translation inhibitor eap1, the mrna-binding protein scp160 and the asc1 protein, specifically inhibits initiation of translation of pom34 mrna that encodes an integral membrane protein of the nuclear pore complex, while having no impact on other mrnas. in response to sesa, pom34 mrna accumulates in the cytoplasm and is not targeted to the er for cotranslational translocation of the protein. reduced level of pom34 is sufficient to restore viability of mutants with defects in spb duplication. we suggest that the sesa network provides a mechanism by which cells can regulate the translation of specific mrnas. this regulation is used to coordinate competing events in the nuclear envelope.
atp hydrolysis provides functions that promote rejection of pairings between different copies of long repeated sequences ideally, self-assembly should rapidly and efficiently produce stable correctly assembled structures. we study the tradeoff between enthalpic and entropic cost in self-assembling systems using reca-mediated homology search as an example. earlier work suggested that reca searches could produce stable final structures with high stringency using a slow testing process that follows an initial rapid search of ∼9-15 bases. in this work, we will show that as a result of entropic and enthalpic barriers, simultaneously testing all ∼9-15 bases as separate individual units results in a longer overall searching time than testing them in groups and stages.
deep nets for local manifold learning many applications, including the image search engine, image inpainting, hyperspectral image dimensionality reduction, pattern recognition, and time series prediction, can be facilitated by considering the given discrete data-set as a point-cloud p in some high dimensional euclidean space r^s. then the problem is to extend a desirable objective function f from a certain relatively smaller training subset c ⊂ p to some continuous manifold x ⊂ r^s that contains p, at least approximately. more precisely, when the point cloud p of the given data-set is modeled in the abstract by some unknown compact manifold embedded in the ambient euclidean space r^s, the extension problem can be considered as the interpolation problem of seeking the objective function on the manifold x that agrees with f on c under certain desirable specifications. for instance, by considering groups of cardinality s of data values as points in a point-cloud in r^s, such groups that are far apart in the original spatial data domain in r^1 or r^2, but have similar geometric properties, can be arranged to be close neighbors on the manifold. the objective of this paper is to incorporate the consideration of data geometry and spatial approximation, with immediate implications to the various directions of application areas. our main result is a point-cloud interpolation formula that provides a near-optimal degree of approximation to the target objective function on the unknown manifold.
formal verification of c systems code structured types, separation logic and theorem proving we present a formal model of memory that both captures the low-level features of c's pointers and memory, and that forms the basis for an expressive implementation of separation logic. at the low level, we do not commit common oversimplifications, but correctly deal with c's model of programming language values and the heap. at the level of separation logic, we are still able to reason abstractly and efficiently. we implement this framework in the theorem prover isabelle/hol and demonstrate it on two case studies. we show that the divide between detailed and abstract does not impose undue verification overhead, and that simple programs remain easy to verify. we also show that the framework is applicable to real, security- and safety-critical code by formally verifying the memory allocator of the l4 microkernel.
hairpins participating in folding of human telomeric sequence quadruplexes studied by standard and t-remd simulations explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations have been used to complement preceding experimental and computational studies of folding of guanine quadruplexes (g-dna). we initiate early stages of unfolding of several g-dnas by simulating them under no-salt conditions and then try to fold them back using standard excess salt simulations. there is a significant difference between g-dnas with all-anti parallel stranded stems and those with stems containing mixtures of syn and anti guanosines. the most natural rearrangement for all-anti stems is a vertical mutual slippage of the strands. this leads to stems with reduced numbers of tetrads during unfolding and a reduction of strand slippage during refolding. the presence of syn nucleotides prevents mutual strand slippage; therefore, the antiparallel and hybrid quadruplexes initiate unfolding via separation of the individual strands. the simulations confirm the capability of g-dna molecules to adopt numerous stable locally and globally misfolded structures. the key point for a proper individual folding attempt appears to be correct prior distribution of syn and anti nucleotides in all four g-strands. the results suggest that at the level of individual molecules, g-dna folding is an extremely multi-pathway process that is slowed by numerous misfolding arrangements stabilized on highly variable timescales.
ion channel clustering enhances weak electric field detection by neutrophils: apparent roles of skf96365-sensitive cation channels and myeloperoxidase trafficking in cellular responses application of extremely low frequency pulsed dc electric fields that are frequency- and phase-matched with endogenous metabolic oscillations leads to greatly exaggerated neutrophil extension and metabolic resonance wherein oscillatory nad(p)h amplitudes are increased. in the presence of a resonant field, migrating cell length grows from 10 to approximately 40 microm, as does the overall length of microfilament assemblies. in contrast, cells stop locomotion and become spherical when exposed to phase-mismatched fields. although cellular effects were not found to be dependent on electrode type and buffer, they were sensitive to temporal constraints (phase and pulse length) and cell surface charge. we suggest an electromechanical coupling hypothesis wherein applied electric fields and cytoskeletal polymerization forces act together to overcome the surface/cortical tension of neutrophils, thus promoting net cytoskeletal assembly and heightened metabolic amplitudes. metabolic resonance enhances reactive oxygen metabolic production by neutrophils. furthermore, cellular dna damage was observed after prolonged metabolic resonance using both single cell gel electrophoresis ('comet' assay) and 3'-oh dna labeling using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. these results provide insights into transmembrane signal processing and cell interactions with weak electric fields.
regulation of endothelial inflammation by tam receptors the endothelial cell is thought to arise from the splanchnopleuric mesoderm. endothelial cells form the inner lining of a blood vessel and provides an anticoagulant barrier between the vessel wall and blood. in addition to its role as a selective permeability barrier, the endothelial cell is a unique multifunctional cell with critical basal and inducible metabolic and synthetic functions. the endothelial cell reacts with physical and chemical stimuli within the circulation and regulates hemostasis, vasomotor tone, and immune and inflammatory responses. in addition, the endothelial cell is pivotal in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. endothelial cell injury, activation or dysfunction is a hallmark of many pathologic states including atherosclerosis, loss of semi-permeable membrane function, and thrombosis. cell facts: (1) endothelium consists of approximately (1-6) x 10(13) endothelial cells forming an almost 1 kg organ. (2) they uniquely contain weibel-palade bodies, 0.1 microm wide, 3 microm long membrane-bound structures that represent the storage organelle for von willebrand factor (vwf). (3) the endothelial cell is not only a permeability barrier but also a multifunctional paracrine and endocrine organ. it is involved in the immune response, coagulation, growth regulation, production of extracellular matrix components, and is a modulator of blood flow and blood vessel tone.
apocynin attenuates left ventricular remodeling in diabetic rabbits increases in nadph oxidase activity, oxidative stress, and myocyte apoptosis coexist in failing hearts. in cardiac myocytes in vitro inhibition of nadph oxidase reduces apoptosis. in this study, we tested the hypothesis that nadph oxidase inhibition reduces myocyte apoptosis and improves cardiac function in heart failure after myocardial infarction (mi). rabbits with heart failure induced by mi and sham-operated animals were randomized to orally receive apocynin, an inhibitor of nadph oxidase (15 mg per day) or placebo for 4 weeks. left ventricular (lv) dimension and function were assessed by echocardiography and hemodynamics. myocardial nadph oxidase activity was measured by superoxide dismutase-inhibitable cytochrome c reduction assay, nadph oxidase subunit p47phox expression by western blot and immunofluorescence analysis, myocardial oxidative stress evaluated by 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-ohdg) and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-hne) using immunohistochemistry, and myocyte apoptosis by tunel assay. mi rabbits exhibited lv dilatation and systolic dysfunction measured by lv fractional shortening and the maximal rate of lv pressure rise (dp/dt). these changes were associated with increases in nadph oxidase activity, p47phox protein expression, 8-ohdg expression, 4-hne expression, myocyte apoptosis, and bax protein and a decrease in bcl-2 protein. apocynin reduced nadph oxidase activity, p47phox protein, oxidative stress, myocyte apoptosis, and bax protein, increased bcl-2 protein, and ameliorated lv dilatation and dysfunction after mi. the results suggest that inhibition of nadph oxidase may represent an attractive therapeutic approach to treat heart failure.
does foreign entry spur innovation? while the role of exports in promoting growth in general, and productivity in particular, has been investigated empirically using aggregate data for countries and industries for a long time, only recently have comprehensive longitudinal data at the firm level been used to look at the extent and causes of productivity differentials between exporters and their counterparts which sell on the domestic market only. this paper surveys the empirical strategies applied, and the results produced, in 45 microeconometric studies with data from 33 countries that were published between 1995 and 2004. details aside, exporters are found to be more productive than non-exporters, and the more productive firms self-select into export markets, while exporting does not necessarily improve productivity.
design automation and test solutions for digital microfluidic biochips microfluidics-based biochips are soon expected to revolutionize clinical diagnosis, dna sequencing, and other laboratory procedures involving molecular biology. most microfluidic biochips today are based on the principle of continuous fluid flow and they rely on permanently etched microchannels, micropumps, and microvalves. we focus here on the automated design of “digital” droplet-based microfluidic biochips. in contrast to conventional continuous-flow systems, digital microfluidics offers dynamic reconfigurability; groups of cells in a microfluidics array can be reconfigured to change their functionality during the concurrent execution of a set of bioassays. we present a simulated annealing-based technique for module placement in such biochips. the placement procedure not only addresses chip area, but also considers fault tolerance, which allows a microfluidic module to be relocated elsewhere in the system when a single cell is detected to be faulty. simulation results are presented for case studies involving the polymerase chain reaction and multiplexed in vitro clinical diagnostics.
hepatocytes produce tnf-α following hypoxia-reoxygenation and liver ischemia-reperfusion in a nadph oxidase- and c-src-dependent manner. reactive oxygen species are ubiquitous signaling molecules in biological systems. four members of the nadph oxidase (nox) enzyme family are important sources of reactive oxygen species in the vasculature: nox1, nox2, nox4, and nox5. signaling cascades triggered by stresses, hormones, vasoactive agents, and cytokines control the expression and activity of these enzymes and of their regulatory subunits, among which p22phox, p47phox, noxa1, and p67phox are present in blood vessels. vascular nox enzymes are also regulated by rac, clc-3, poldip2, and protein disulfide isomerase. multiple nox subtypes, simultaneously present in different subcellular compartments, produce specific amounts of superoxide, some of which is rapidly converted to hydrogen peroxide. the identity and location of these reactive oxygen species, and of the enzymes that degrade them, determine their downstream signaling pathways. nox enzymes participate in a broad array of cellular functions, including differentiation, fibrosis, growth, proliferation, apoptosis, cytoskeletal regulation, migration, and contraction. they are involved in vascular pathologies such as hypertension, restenosis, inflammation, atherosclerosis, and diabetes. as our understanding of the regulation of these oxidases progresses, so will our ability to alter their functions and associated pathologies.
two at once: enhancing learning and generalization capacities via ibn-net deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. we present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. we explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. we provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. on the imagenet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8× deeper than vgg nets [40] but still having lower complexity. an ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the imagenet test set. this result won the 1st place on the ilsvrc 2015 classification task. we also present analysis on cifar-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. the depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the coco object detection dataset. deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ilsvrc & coco 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of imagenet detection, imagenet localization, coco detection, and coco segmentation.
satellite image forgery detection and localization using gan and one-class classifier we propose a new method for single-image splicing localization. lacking any side information, such as training data or prior knowledge on the source camera and the image history, we cast the problem as an anomaly detection task. expressive local features, extracted from the noise residual of the image, feed an autoencoder which generates an implicit model of the data. by iterating discriminative feature labeling and autoencoding, the implicit model fits eventually the pristine data, while the spliced region is recognized as anomalous. experiments on a suitable test set of spliced images show that the proposed method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art. in addition, it exhibits a good robustness against typical social net post-processing, showing promises for real-world applications.
bioavailability and risk assessment of orally ingested polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons five healthy volunteers consumed similar amounts of identical foods for 5 consecutive days. the concentration of pyrene and of benzo(a)pyrene was determined in each of the 15 meals by a short analytical method that included sample saponification, solvent extraction, and hplc analysis. the volunteers also provided three daily total volume 8-h urine samples for the duration of the study for the assessment of 1-hydroxypyrene, a biomarker of pyrene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (pah) exposure. mean recoveries were 83 and 75%, respectively, for pyrene and benzo(a)pyrene in food. daily dietary pyrene doses varied from 0.7 to 3 microg. excluding two outliers consisting of meals containing charbroiled pork and beef, pyrene content in the meals estimated from the published literature data was correlated to the measured pyrene, but overestimated the actual concentration by ca. 70%. despite the identical ingested doses of pyrene, there was a 50-76% (coefficient of variation) interindividual variability in the daily-excreted amount of 1-hydroxypyrene. urinary excretion of this metabolite was not correlated with ingested dose of pyrene under the normal feeding conditions used in this study. bioavailability, enzymatic polymorphism, and differences in enterohepatic cycling of the metabolite may contribute to the observed variability. it was calculated that dietary pyrene intake accounts for between 87.5 and 99.8% of the sum of dietary and inhalation intake. from the presented data, unless the above-mentioned factors are taken into account, 1-hydroxypyrene might not be a reliable bioindicator of ingested pyrene (pahs) under normal feeding conditions.
how are global value chains fragmented and extended in china's domestic production networks? this article analyzes the distribution of financial value from innovation in the global supply chains of ipods and notebook computers. we find that apple has captured a great deal of value from the innovation embodied in the ipod, while notebook makers capture a more modest share of the value from pc innovation. in order to understand these differences, we employ concepts from theories of innovation and industrial organization, finding significant roles for industry evolution, complementary assets, appropriability, system integration, and bargaining power. copyright 2010 the author 2009. published by oxford university press on behalf of associazione icc. all rights reserved., oxford university press.
fatty acid handling protein expression in adipose tissue, fatty acid composition of adipose tissue and serum, and markers of insulin resistance the cellular basis of insulin resistance is still unknown; however, relationships have been demonstrated between insulin action in muscle and the fatty acid profile of the major membrane structural lipid (phospholipid). the present study aimed to further investigate the hypothesis that insulin action and adiposity are associated with changes in the structural lipid composition of the cell. in 52 adult male pima indians, insulin action (euglycemic clamp), percentage body fat (pfat; underwater weighing), and muscle phospholipid fatty acid composition (percutaneous biopsy of vastus lateralis) were determined. insulin action (high-dose clamp; mz) correlated with composite measures of membrane unsaturation (% c20-22 polyunsaturated fatty acids [r= 0.463, p < 0.001], unsaturation index [r= -0.369, p < 0.01]), a number of individual fatty acids and with delta5 desaturase activity (r= 0.451, p < 0.001). pfat (range 14-53%) correlated with a number of individual fatty acids and delta5 desaturase activity (r= -0.610, p < 0.0001). indices of elongase activity (r= -0.467, p < 0.001), and delta9 desaturase activity (r= 0.332, p < 0.05) were also related to pfat but not insulin action. the results demonstrate that delta5 desaturase activity is independently related to both insulin resistance and obesity. while determining the mechanisms underlying this relationship is important for future investigations, strategies aimed at restoring "normal" enzyme activities, and membrane unsaturation, may have therapeutic importance in the "syndromes of insulin resistance."
observed versus predicted outcome for decompressive craniectomy: a population-based study. objectivedevelop and validate a predictive model of the incidence of long-term disability following traumatic brain injury (tbi) and obtain national estimates for the united states in 2003. data/methodsa logistic regression model was built, using a population-based sample of persons with tbi from the south carolina traumatic brain injury follow-up registry. the regression coefficients were applied to the 2003 healthcare cost and utilization project–nationwide inpatient sample data to estimate the incidence of long-term disability following traumatic brain injury hospitalization. resultsamong 288,009 (95% ci, 287,974–288,043) hospitalized tbi survivors in the united states in 2003, an estimated 124,626 (95% ci, 123,706–125,546) had developed long-term disability. conclusiontbi-related disability is a significant public health problem in the united states. the substantial incidence suggests the need for comprehensive rehabilitative care and services to maximize the potential of persons with tbi.
reduced hemispheric asymmetry of brain anatomical networks in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder a growing body of work utilizing structural and functional brain imaging and neurocognitive measures of executive and attentional function indicates anomalous asymmetry in adhd. this study examined the white-matter volume and diffusion properties of frontostriatal tracts, as a function of hemisphere, in adhd and healthy controls. forty-three young males (21 adhd–combined type and 22 controls) aged 10–18 years underwent structural and diffusion weighted mri. tractography applying constrained spherical deconvolution (csd) was used to construct frontostriatal tracts between each of caudate and putamen and each of dorsolateral prefrontal, ventrolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices (dlpfc, vlpfc and ofc) in each hemisphere, to examine both volumetric and diffusion microstructure properties. young people with adhd did not show the right hemisphere lateralization of volume in the caudate-vlpfc and caudate-dlpfc tracts that was evident in controls, however the adhd group displayed a pronounced lateralization to the left for fractional anisotropy in the putamen-vlpfc tracts. the degree of volume asymmetry did not correlate with symptom severity; however fractional anisotropy (fa) values that were more strongly lateralized to the left in the putamen-vlpfc white matter were associated with greater symptom severity. adhd was associated with anomalous hemispheric asymmetries in both tract volume and underlying white-matter microstructure in major fibre tracts of the frontostriatal system. our observations of both weaker lateralization to the right in terms of tract volume and stronger lateralization to the left in terms of fa values for the adhd group, suggests that previous inconsistencies in the literature may reflect the influence of such asymmetries.
an algebraic formulation of inverse problems in mp dynamics metabolic p systems, shortly mp systems, are a special class of deterministic p systems, introduced for expressing biological metabolism. their dynamics are computed by a special type of regulated multiset rewriting. in this chapter the basic results on mp systems are indicated and a procedure is outlined for constructing mp models of biological processes from time series of observed dynamics.
mineral composition is altered by osteoblast expression of an engineered gs-coupled receptor the authors report the results of the management of five consecutive children with mccune-albright syndrome. these children were treated with a combination of drug treatment (bisphosphonates) and surgical treatment with elongating intramedullary rods (sheffield) for management of femoral and tibial lesions. this treatment was successful in all patients, as judged by improvement in their quality of life and in clinical parameters, such as decreased bone pain and fracture rate, and improved walking ability. two of the five children had been wheelchair-bound before treatment. all children are now community ambulators. in 5 of 10 hips, there was a significant decrease in the neck-shaft angle over time compared with the immediate postoperative angle.
characterization of a recombinant amylolytic enzyme of hyperthermophilic archaeon thermofilum pendens with extremely thermostable maltogenic amylase activity shimizu et al. and ourselves have reported some enzymatic properties of an alpha-amylase from thermoactinomyces vulgaris r-47 that hydrolyzed pullulan to produce panose [m. shimizu et al., agric. biol. chem., 42, 1681-1688 (1978); y. sakano et al., agric. biol. chem., 46, 1121-1129 (1982)]. in this study, we cloned a gene for an alpha-amylase, which was different from the one mentioned above but also hydrolyzed pullulan to produce panose, from t. vulgaris r-47, and analyzed the entire primary structure of the gene. we designated the previously reported enzyme as t. vulgaris alpha-amylase i (tva i), and this novel enzyme as t. vulgaris alpha-amylase ii (tva ii). the nucleotide sequence had an open reading frame of 1755 base pairs corresponding to a protein of 585 amino acid residues. although this novel alpha-amylase, tva ii, hydrolyzed both pullulan and starch, the ratio of pullulan-hydrolyzing activity to starch-hydrolyzing activity of the enzyme was higher than that of tva i, and the primary structure of the enzyme resembled neopullulanase, which scarcely hydrolyzed starch, rather than that of tva i.
how quickly can we adapt to change? an assessment of hurricane damage mitigation efforts using forecast uncertainty damage due to tropical cyclones accounts for more than 50% of all meteorologically-induced economic losses worldwide. their nominal impact is projected to increase substantially as the exposed population grows, per capita income increases, and anthropogenic climate change manifests. so far, historical losses due to tropical cyclones have been found to increase less than linearly with a nation's affected gross domestic product (gdp). here we show that for the united states this scaling is caused by a sub-linear increase with affected population while relative losses scale super-linearly with per capita income. the finding is robust across a multitude of empirically derived damage models that link the storm's wind speed, exposed population, and per capita gdp to reported losses. the separation of both socio-economic predictors strongly affects the projection of potential future hurricane losses. separating the effects of growth in population and per-capita income, per hurricane losses with respect to national gdp are projected to triple by the end of the century under unmitigated climate change, while they are estimated to decrease slightly without the separation.
the inability of bacillus licheniformis perr mutant to grow is mainly due to the lack of perr-mediated fur repression perr is a ferric uptake repressor (fur) homolog that functions as the central regulator of the inducible peroxide stress response in bacillus subtilis. perr has been previously demonstrated to regulate the mrga, kata, ahpcf, hemaxcdbl, and zosa genes. we now demonstrate that perr also mediates both the repression of its own gene and that of fur. whereas perr-mediated repression of most target genes can be elicited by either manganese or iron, repression of perr and fur is selective for manganese. genetic studies indicate that repression of perr regulon genes by either manganese or iron requires perr and is generally independent of fur. indeed, in a fur mutant, iron-mediated repression is enhanced. unexpectedly, repression of the fur gene by manganese appears to require both perr and fur, but only perr binds to the fur regulatory region in vitro. the fur mutation appears to act indirectly by affecting cellular metal ion pools and thereby affecting perr-mediated repression. while many components of the perr regulon are strongly induced by hydrogen peroxide, little, if any, induction of fur and perr could be demonstrated. thus, not all components of the perr regulon are components of the peroxide stimulon. we suggest that perr exists in distinct metallated forms that differ in dna target selectivity and in sensitivity to oxidation. this model is supported by the observation that the metal ion composition of the growth medium can greatly influence the transcriptional response of the various perr regulon genes to hydrogen peroxide.
alternative interventions to prevent oxidative damage following ischemia/reperfusion oxidative stress is considered a major contributor to etiology of both “normal” senescence and severe pathologies with serious public health implications. mitochondria generate reactive oxygen species (ros) that are thought to augment intracellular oxidative stress. mitochondria possess at least nine known sites that are capable of generating superoxide anion, a progenitor ros. mitochondria also possess numerous ros defense systems that are much less studied. studies of the last three decades shed light on many important mechanistic details of mitochondrial ros production, but the bigger picture remains obscure. this review summarizes the current knowledge about major components involved in mitochondrial ros metabolism and factors that regulate ros generation and removal. an integrative, systemic approach is applied to analysis of mitochondrial ros metabolism, which is now dissected into mitochondrial ros production, mitochondrial ros removal, and mitochondrial ros emission. it is suggested that mitochondria augment intracellular oxidative stress due primarily to failure of their ros removal systems, whereas the role of mitochondrial ros emission is yet to be determined and a net increase in mitochondrial ros production in situ remains to be demonstrated.
does dietary folic acid supplementation in mouse ntd models affect neural tube development or gamete preference at fertilization? neural tube defects (ntd), including anencephaly and spina bifida, are a group of severe congenital abnormalities in which the future brain and/or spinal cord fail to close. in mice, ntd may result from genetic mutations or knockouts, or from exposure to teratogenic agents, several of which are known risk factors in humans. among the many mouse ntd models that have been identified to date, a number have been tested for possible primary prevention of ntd by exogenous agents, such as folic acid. in genetic ntd models such as cart1, splotch, cited2, and crooked tail, and ntd induced by teratogens including valproic acid and fumonisins, the incidence of defects is reduced by maternal folic acid supplementation. these folate‐responsive models provide an opportunity to investigate the possible mechanisms underlying prevention of ntd by folic acid in humans. in another group of mouse models, that includes curly tail, axial defects, and the ephrin‐a5 knockout, ntd are not preventable by folic acid, reflecting the situation in humans in which a subset of ntd appear resistant to folic acid therapy. in this group of mutants alternative preventive agents, including inositol and methionine, have been shown to be effective. overall, the data from mouse models suggests that a broad‐based in utero therapy may offer scope for prevention of a greater proportion of ntd than is currently possible. © 2005 wiley‐liss, inc.
time adaptation shows duration selectivity in the human parietal cortex we review evidence for partially segregated networks of brain areas that carry out different attentional functions. one system, which includes parts of the intraparietal cortex and superior frontal cortex, is involved in preparing and applying goal-directed (top-down) selection for stimuli and responses. this system is also modulated by the detection of stimuli. the other system, which includes the temporoparietal cortex and inferior frontal cortex, and is largely lateralized to the right hemisphere, is not involved in top-down selection. instead, this system is specialized for the detection of behaviourally relevant stimuli, particularly when they are salient or unexpected. this ventral frontoparietal network works as a 'circuit breaker' for the dorsal system, directing attention to salient events. both attentional systems interact during normal vision, and both are disrupted in unilateral spatial neglect.
angiopoietin-2 impairs collateral artery growth associated with the suppression of the infiltration of macrophages in mouse hindlimb ischaemia objective—recently, we have shown that shear stress regulates the angiogenic potential of endothelial cells in vitro by an angiopoietin-2 (ang2)–dependent mechanism; however its pathophysiological significance in vivo was not clear. we hypothesized that ang2 plays an important role in blood flow recovery after arterial occlusion in vivo by regulating angiogenesis and arteriogenesis. methods and results—c57bl/6j mice underwent femoral artery ligation and were injected with a specific ang2 inhibitor, l1-10, or vehicle for 10 days. ang2 mrna was upregulated at day 2, and ang2 protein was upregulated at day 2, 5, and 7 in the ligated hindlimb. l1-10 treatment significantly blunted blood flow recovery. l1-10 decreased smooth muscle cell coverage of neovessels without affecting capillary density, suggesting a specific role for ang2 in arteriogenesis. mechanistically, l1-10 decreased expression of intercellular and vascular cell adhesion molecules as well as infiltrating monocytes/macrophages in the ischemic tissue. although l1-10 had no effect on the number of cd11b+ cells (monocytes/macrophages) mobilized in the bone marrow, it maintained elevated numbers of circulating cd11b+ cells in the peripheral blood. conclusions—these results suggest that ang2 induced in ischemic tissue plays a critical role in blood flow recovery by stimulating inflammation and arteriogenesis.
the six metal binding domains in human copper transporter, atp7b: molecular biophysics and disease-causing mutations backgroundwilson﻿'s disease ﻿with﻿ osseomuscular type is a rare condition, which often lacks typical hepatic and neurological symptoms and causes misdiagnoses easily. during the past 10 years, eight chinese patients of osseomuscular type of wilson's disease were identified in our clinic.methodsclinical information was gathered from medical records and follow-ups. the genetic testing was performed in each patient. serum ceruloplasmin, kayser-fleischer rings, liver function, brain magnetic resonance imaging and abdominal ultrasonography were also evaluated.resultsthe median age of onset is 12 years of age. the patients had their initial musculoskeletal conditions with arthralgia or joint deformity, while the hepatic or neurologic signs were minimal. most patients (6/8) eventually developed clinical neurological symptoms afterwards with a median interval of 36 months. all of them had normal liver function and low serum ceruloplasmin (<0.1 g/l). most patients (6/8) present with kayser-fleischer rings and abnormal hepatic ultrasonography. the arthralgia was resolved with copper chelation therapy.conclusionswilson’s disease with osseomuscular type occurs without typical hepatic or neurological symptoms, which makes the clinical diagnosis challenging. serum ceruloplasmin, abdominal ultrasonography, ophthalmic examination and genetic testing help to establish the diagnosis. early diagnosis can initiate an effective treatment and prevent the further damage.
automatic extraction of process categories from process model collections clustering is a useful technique that organizes a large quantity of unordered text documents into a small number of meaningful and coherent clusters, thereby providing a basis for intuitive and informative navigation and browsing mechanisms. partitional clustering algorithms have been recognized to be more suitable as opposed to the hierarchical clustering schemes for processing large datasets. a wide variety of distance functions and similarity measures have been used for clustering, such as squared euclidean distance, cosine similarity, and relative entropy. in this paper, we compare and analyze the eectiveness of these measures in partitional clustering for text document datasets. our experiments utilize the standard kmeans algorithm and we report results on seven text document datasets and five distance/similarity measures that have been most commonly used in text clustering.
mathematical model of the neonatal mouse ventricular action potential. it has been proposed that the activity of the cardiac sarcolemmal na+/ca2+ exchanger may be greatest in developing animals before the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) reaches functional maturity. experiments were performed in rabbits, which have a sparse sr at birth, and in newborn guinea pigs, which exhibit a more extensive sr. whole cell voltage clamp techniques were used to characterize the ni(2+)-sensitive na+/ca2+ exchange current in single freshly isolated cardiac myocytes. na+/ca2+ exchange current was measured from a holding potential of -40 mv by using a slow-ramp voltage protocol (-120 to +60 mv, 0.09 v/s) in the presence of ba2+, cs+, tetraethylammonia, d-600, and ouabain to block ca2+, na+, and k+ currents. experiments in developing rabbits (1-22 days old) demonstrated that na+/ca2+ exchange current density was greatest at 1-4 days and declined rapidly over the first 3 wk of age. in contrast, na+/ca2+ exchange current density in newborn guinea pig myocytes did not differ from that recorded in adults. these results confirm that na+/ca2+ exchange is functional at birth in both rabbits and guinea pigs. the species-related difference in the ontogeny of na+/ca2+ exchange is consistent with the concept that na+/ca2+ exchange assumes a relatively greater role in newborn animals with a sparse sr.
prevalence and causes of low vision and blindness in an elderly population in nepal: the bhaktapur retina study background a national eye care programme was launched in nepal in the early 1980s. the impact of this programme on blindness and cataract surgery prevalence was evaluated in two geographic zones. methods people aged 45 years and older were sampled using a stratified cluster design. within randomly selected clusters, door to door enumeration was followed by visual acuity measurement and eye examinations at conveniently located sites. the full survey was preceded by a pilot study where operational methods were refined and quality assurance measures carried out. results of the 5112 enumerated individuals 90% were examined. blindness, defined as presenting visual acuity less than 6/60 in both eyes, was found in 5.3% (95% ci 3.6, 6.8) of individuals examined, with cataract being the principal cause in at least one eye in 78% of cases. considering both cataract operated and unoperated cataract blind cases, surgical coverage was approximately 42%. conclusion the findings suggest that blindness prevalence may have decreased slightly from that estimated in a 1981 national survey, both overall and cataract related. similarly, cataract surgical coverage may have increased somewhat. none of these changes, however, are at statistically significant levels. accordingly, the blindness problem remains challengingly high.
antibacterial and mechanical properties of propolis added to glass ionomer cement. many oral pathologies, such as dental caries, periodontal disease and peri-implantitis are plaque-related. dental plaque is a microbial biofilm formed by organisms tightly bound to a solid substrate and each other by means of an exopolymer matrix. bacteria exhibit different properties when contained within a biofilm. knowing the mechanisms controlling the formation and development of biofilms can help to understand the emergence and progression of such pathologies and to plan effective treatment. most periodontal pathogens are common saprophytes of the oral cavity, expressing their virulence only in a susceptible host or when some changes come about in the oral environment. physical, metabolic and physiological interactions may cause positive or negative effects among the various microbiota present. such mechanisms of antagonism/synergy select the bacterial population and alterations of its composition affect the balance with the host and may lead to pathology. the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents, as measured through in vitro tests, is dramatically reduced in vivo due to the properties of the microbial community: mature, intact biofilms are less sensitive to such agents, as the exopolymer matrix, bacterial enzymes and slow growth rate hinder the action of chemotherapeutic agents. the present literature review aims to examine the most representative studies, focusing on the characteristics of bacterial communities and the crucial shift from oral health to plaque-related diseases.
common activation of canonical wnt signaling in pancreatic adenocarcinoma zinc finger-containing gli proteins mediate responsiveness to hedgehog (hh) signaling, with gli2 acting as the major transcriptional activator in this pathway in mice. the discovery of disease-associated mutations points to a critical role for gli2 in human hh signaling as well. here, we show that human gli2 contains previously undescribed 5' sequence, extending the amino-terminus an additional 328 amino acids. in vitro, transcriptional activity of full-length gli2 is up to 30 times lower than that of gli2deltan (previously thought to represent the entire gli2 protein), revealing the presence of an amino-terminal repressor domain in the full-length protein. gli2deltan also exhibits potent transcriptional activity in vivo: overexpression in mouse skin leads to the formation of hh-independent epithelial downgrowths resembling basal cell carcinomas, which in humans are associated with constitutive hh signaling. the discovery of this additional, functionally relevant gli2 sequence led us to re-examine several pathogenic human gli2 mutants, now containing the entire amino-terminal domain. on the basis of the functional domains affected by the mutations, mutant gli2 proteins exhibited either loss-of-function or dominant-negative activity. moreover, deletion of the amino-terminus abrogated dominant-negative activity of mutant gli2, revealing that this domain is required for transcriptional repressor activity of pathogenic gli2. our results establish the presence of an amino-terminal transcriptional repressor domain that plays a critical role in modulating the function of wild-type gli2 and is essential for dominant-negative activity of a gli2 mutant associated with human disease.
the effect of high-intensity aerobic interval training on markers of systemic inflammation in sedentary populations purposelong-term physical activity is reported to improve chronic systemic inflammation, which provides protection against the ensuing development of chronic disease. accordingly, the present study assessed changes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, aerobic capacity and body composition following 8 weeks of either small-sided games (ssg) or cycling (cyc) training compared to a sedentary control (con) condition.methodsthirty-three middle-aged, sedentary men were randomized into cyc (n = 11), ssg (n = 11), or con (n = 11) conditions. the cyc and ssg conditions trained 3 days/week for 8 weeks, whilst con maintained habitual activity and dietary patterns. pre- and post-intervention testing included a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan, sub-maximal (80 % maximal heart rate) aerobic capacity (vo2) and fasting venous blood. venous blood measures for pro-inflammatory markers included c-reactive protein (crp), interleukin (il)-6, il-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and leptin; anti-inflammatory markers included il-10, il-1 receptor agonist, and adiponectin.resultsboth cyc and ssg increased submaximal power output and vo2 (p < 0.05), decreased total body fat-mass (tb-fm; p < 0.05), and crp (ssg, −0.45 ± 0.42 mg l−1; p = 0.008; cyc, −0.44 ± 0.59 mg l−1; p = 0.02). only ssg increased total body fat-free mass (tb-ffm; +1.1 ± 1.2 kg; p = 0.001) and decreased concentration of plasma il-6 (−0.69 ± 0.62 pg ml−1; p = 0.002) and leptin (−2,212 ± 2,531 ng ml−1; p = 0.014).conclusioncycling and ssg training were both effective at improving crp, vo2 and tb-fm. furthermore, ssg training has also shown to be an effective training approach in reducing il-6 and leptin and increasing muscle mass within sedentary, middle-aged men.
prevalence of depression and its correlations: a cross-sectional study in thai cancer patients. increased survival rates resulting from advances in the treatment of cancer have led to an increased interest in patients' emotional reactions and adaptations to the illness. depressive symptoms associated with cancer range from normal sadness through acute stress response to major depression. chemotherapeutic agents can produce depressive and other neurotoxic side effects. diagnosis of common emotional reactions to cancer illness and appropriate management are described. such treatment can enhance the patient's ability to adapt to the disease and tolerate its treatments.
dialog intent structure: a hierarchical schema of linked dialog acts this paper summarizes the latest, final version of iso standard 24617-2 ``semantic annotation framework, part 2: dialogue acts"""". compared to the preliminary version iso dis 24617-2:2010, described in bunt et al. (2010), the final version additionally includes concepts for annotating rhetorical relations between dialogue units, defines a full-blown compositional semantics for the dialogue act markup language diaml (resulting, as a side-effect, in a different treatment of functional dependence relations among dialogue acts and feedback dependence relations); and specifies an optimally transparent xml-based reference format for the representation of diaml annotations, based on the systematic application of the notion of `ideal concrete syntax'. we describe these differences and briefly discuss the design and implementation of an incremental method for dialogue act recognition, which proves the usability of the iso standard for automatic dialogue annotation.
transcriptome analysis and discovery of genes involved in immune pathways from hepatopancreas of microbial challenged mitten crab eriocheir sinensis lipid a, the conserved portion of endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide, is the major mediator of septic shock, and therefore endotoxin-neutralizing molecules could have important clinical applications. the crystal structure of recombinant limulus anti-lipopolysaccharide factor (rlalf) (hoess, a., watson, s., siber, g. r., and liddington, r. (1993) embo j. 12, 3351-3356), has been used to design synthetic peptides comprising different parts of the exposed amphipathic loop in the proposed endotoxin-binding domain of rlalf. we investigated the minimal requirements of rlalf for endotoxin and lipid a binding with linear 10-mer peptides. only one linear peptide, corresponding to amino acids 36-45 of rlalf, was able to bind lipid a and endotoxin above background levels. cyclic peptides, however, bind lipid a and endotoxin with high affinity, presumably by mimicking the three dimensional characteristics of the exposed hairpin loop. the cyclic peptide including amino acids 36-47, lalf-14, has a lipid a binding activity comparable to the high affinity endotoxin-binding peptide polymyxin b. lalf-14 has an improved serum half-life compared with its linear counterpart, and it is not toxic for cultured human monocytes or red blood cells. in mice, it blocks tumor necrosis factor-α induction after endotoxin challenge. the characterization of the minimal endotoxin-binding domain of rlalf and, importantly, its structure provided a basis for designing small molecules that could have prophylactic and/or therapeutic properties in humans for the management of septic shock.
evidence that fibroblasts derive from epithelium during tissue fibrosis. progressive tissue fibrosis can compromise epithelial function resulting in organ failure. appreciating evidence suggests that fibroblasts provide fibrogenic collagens during such injury. we further tested this notion by attempting to reduce the physiologic consequences of organ fibrosis through the selective killing of fibroblasts at sites of injury. here, we report the conditional reduction of tissue fibroblasts using the coding sequence for herpesvirus thymidine kinase (deltatk) put under the control of a cell-specific promoter from the gene encoding fibroblast-specific protein 1 (fsp1). transgenic fibroblasts from mice carrying fsp1.deltatk minigenes expressed thymidine kinase concordantly with native fsp1 and, compared to transgenic epithelium, were selectively susceptible to the lethal effects of nucleoside analogs either in culture or during experimental renal fibrosis. the numbers of fibroblasts in fibrogenic kidney tissue were reduced on exposure to nucleoside analogs as was the degree of type i collagen deposition and the extent of fibrosis. fibroblast reduction following the stress of dna chain termination highlights the important contribution of cell division during fibrogenesis. our findings convey a proof of principle regarding the importance of fsp1(+) fibroblasts in fibrosis as well as providing a new approach to treating the relentless scarification of tissue.
a physical map for the amborella trichopoda genome sheds light on the evolution of angiosperm genome structure the abc model of floral organ identity is based on studies of arabidopsis and antirrhinum, both of which are highly derived eudicots. most of the genes required for the abc functions in arabidopsis and antirrhinum are members of the mads-box gene family, and their orthologs are present in all major angiosperm lineages. although the eudicots comprise 75% of all angiosperms, most of the diversity in arrangement and number of floral parts is actually found among basal angiosperm lineages, for which little is known about the genes that control floral development. to investigate the conservation and divergence of expression patterns of floral mads-box genes in basal angiosperms relative to eudicot model systems, we isolated several floral mads-box genes and examined their expression patterns in representative species, including amborella (amborellaceae), nuphar (nymphaeaceae) and illicium (austrobaileyales), the successive sister groups to all other extant angiosperms, plus magnolia and asimina, members of the large magnoliid clade. our results from multiple methods (relative-quantitative rt-pcr, real-time pcr and rna in situ hybridization) revealed that expression patterns of floral mads-box genes in basal angiosperms are broader than those of their counterparts in eudicots and monocots. in particular, (i) ap1 homologs are generally expressed in all floral organs and leaves, (ii) ap3/pi homologs are generally expressed in all floral organs and (iii) ag homologs are expressed in stamens and carpels of most basal angiosperms, in agreement with the expectations of the abc model; however, an ag homolog is also expressed in the tepals of illicium. the broader range of strong expression of ap3/pi homologs is inferred to be the ancestral pattern for all angiosperms and is also consistent with the gradual morphological intergradations often observed between adjacent floral organs in basal angiosperms.
cyberknife radiosurgery for the treatment of intraocular and periocular lymphoma. immunodysregulation appears to play a prominent role in the evolution of some lymphomas, as evidenced by the strong associations between congenital and acquired immunodeficiencies and lymphoid neoplasia, and abnormal ratios of helper t cells in lymphoid proliferations. lympho-proliferative diseases of the ocular adnexa encompass a spectrum of lesions that may present with similar clinical and radiological features. most primary lymphoid proliferations of the ocular adnexa consist of small lymphocytes of b-cell origin. employing morphological, immunohistochemical, and molecular genetic criteria, proliferations may be separated into polyclonal and monoclonal categories. increased insight into the biology and behavior of these tumors tells us that seemingly benign, as well as frankly malignant proliferations, might disseminate to nodal or extranodal sites. the diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disease of any type necessitates a complete workup for systemic lymphoma. major prognostic criteria for lymphomas are anatomical site, stage, and histological features. radiotherapy is employed for localized lymphoid proliferations, with chemotherapy recommended for disseminated disease. long-term follow-up with semiannual examination is recommended. a significant percentage of primary ocular adnexal lymphoid lesions are malt-type lymphomas, extranodal low-grade b-cell lymphomas usually associated with mucosal tissues or glandular epithelia. the pathogenesis of this lymphoma in orbital soft tissue, which normally is devoid of lymphoid tissue, lymphatic vessels, and epithelium, is unclear. malt-type lymphomas of the ocular adnexa follow an indolent course, with long periods between relapses, and are responsive to therapy. dissemination, when it occurs, preferentially affects other extranodal sites.
oncological outcomes following radical prostatectomy for patients with pt4 prostate cancer purpose pretreatment risk assessment models facilitate more appropriate selection of treatment for prostate cancer. however, men with high risk disease remain a challenge with significant potential for primary treatment failure. we characterize patterns of treatment for high risk prostate cancer in a community based cohort.   materials and methods in the cancer of the prostate strategic urological research endeavor (capsure) database, a longitudinal disease registry of men with prostate cancer, we identified those with nonmetastatic, high risk disease based on t stage, tumor grade and serum prostate specific antigen (psa). differences in primary treatment, and the use of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy in patients at low, intermediate and high risk were assessed. in the high risk cohort predictors of the type of primary treatment, and the use of neoadjuvant and adjuvant androgen therapy were identified.   results of the cancers 34%, 40% and 26% were low, intermediate and high risk, respectively. differences in primary treatment type among the 3 risk groups were statistically significant (p <0.0001) with increasing external beam radiation therapy and androgen deprivation, and decreased surgery, brachytherapy and surveillance in men with high risk cancers. in this group older age, higher psa and nonprivate insurance were associated with decreased use of radical prostatectomy. more than half of the men at high risk receiving radiation therapy also received androgen deprivation, which was significantly higher than in the low and intermediate risk groups (p <0.0001). factors associated with androgen deprivation in high risk disease were primary therapy, psa, gleason sum, t stage, body mass index, insurance status and ethnicity. psa and gleason sum were the primary determinants of adjuvant radiation after prostatectomy.   conclusions men with high risk but nonmetastatic prostate cancer are more likely to receive radiation therapy as well as androgen deprivation with the latter as primary therapy or in conjunction with local treatment. these data stress the importance of pretreatment risk stratification, education regarding appropriate combinations of local and systemic therapies, and the consideration of novel clinical trials in patients at higher risk.
age-related changes in the epithelial and stromal compartments of the mammary gland in normocalcemic mice lacking the vitamin d3 receptor the mammary gland is subjected to major morphological and biochemical changes during the lactation cycle. it is therefore not surprising that this dynamic process is strictly controlled. the importance of the sex steroid hormones 17beta-estradiol and progesterone for normal development of the mammary gland was recognized several decades ago and has been unequivocally confirmed since. furthermore, it is now also established that the influence of sex steroids is not restricted to mammogenesis, but that these hormones also control involution. another important regulatory role is played by growth factors that have been shown to modulate survival (epidermal growth factor, amphiregulin, transforming growth factor alpha, insulin like growth factor, and tumor necrosis factor alpha) or apoptosis (tumor necrosis factor alpha, transforming growth factor beta) of mammary cells. however, the molecular mechanism underlying the influence of sex steroid hormones and/or growth factors on the development and function of the mammary gland remains largely unknown to date. also scarce is information on the interaction between both groups of modulators. nevertheless, based on the current indications compiled in this review, an important functional role for sex steroid hormones in the lactation cycle in co-operation with growth factors can be suggested.
decentralized information-theoretic task assignment for searching and tracking of moving targets a new framework which adopts a rapidly-exploring random tree (rrt) path planner with a gaussian process (gp) occupancy map is developed for the navigation and exploration of an unknown but cluttered environment. the gp map outputs the probability of occupancy given any selected query point in the continuous space and thus makes it possible to explore the full space when used in conjunction with a continuous path planner. furthermore, the gp map-generated path is embedded with the probability of collision along the path which lends itself to obstacle avoidance. finally, the gp map-building algorithm is extended to include an exploration mission considering the differential constraints of a rotary unmanned aerial vehicle and the limitation arising from the environment. using mutual information as an information-theoretic measure, an informative path which reduces the uncertainty of the environment is generated. simulation results show that gp map combined with rrt planner can achieve the 3d navigation and exploration task successfully in unknown and complex environments.
clinical information retrieval using document and pico structure background information retrieval in primary care is becoming more difficult as the volume of medical information held in electronic databases expands. the lexical structure of this information might permit automatic indexing and improved retrieval.   objective to determine the possibility of identifying the key elements of clinical studies, namely patient-population-problem, exposure-intervention, comparison, outcome, duration and results (pecodr), from abstracts of medical journals.   methods we used a convenience sample of 20 synopses from the journal evidence-based medicine (ebm) and their matching original journal article abstracts obtained from pubmed. three independent primary care professionals identified pecodr-related extracts of text. rules were developed to define each pecodr element and the selection process of characters, words, phrases and sentences. from the extracts of text related to pecodr elements, potential lexical patterns that might help identify those elements were proposed and assessed using nvivo software.   results a total of 835 pecodr-related text extracts containing 41,263 individual text characters were identified from 20 ebm journal synopses. there were 759 extracts in the corresponding pubmed abstracts containing 31,947 characters. pecodr elements were found in nearly all abstracts and synopses with the exception of duration. there was agreement on 86.6% of the extracts from the 20 ebm synopses and 85.0% on the corresponding pubmed abstracts. after consensus this rose to 98.4% and 96.9% respectively. we found potential text patterns in the comparison, outcome and results elements of both ebm synopses and pubmed abstracts. some phrases and words are used frequently and are specific for these elements in both synopses and abstracts.   conclusions results suggest a pecodr-related structure exists in medical abstracts and that there might be lexical patterns specific to these elements. more sophisticated computer-assisted lexical-semantic analysis might refine these results, and pave the way to automating pecodr indexing, and improve information retrieval in primary care.
evolution and resolution of human brain perfusion responses to the stress of induced hypoglycemia the lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvinar are examples of two different types of relay: the former is a first order relay, transmitting information from a subcortical source (retina), while the latter is mostly a higher order relay, transmitting information from layer 5 of one cortical area to another cortical area. first and higher order thalamic relays can also be recognized for much of the rest of thalamus, and most of thalamus seems to be comprised of higher order relays. higher order relays seem especially important to general corticocortical communication, and this challenges and extends the conventional view that such communication is based on direct corticocortical connections.
the lectin-like domain of thrombomodulin hampers host defence in pneumococcal pneumonia previously, two rat monoclonal antibodies where developed which bind distinct epitopes on a murine glycoprotein, p112, which is expressed primarily in lung capillary endothelium. in this paper we show that p112 is identical to the endothelial anticoagulant protein, thrombomodulin (tm). several lines of evidence support this conclusion. first, amino acid analysis of p112 shows a high degree of homology to tm, and both molecules exhibit the same mobility in gel electrophoresis. second, p112 and tm share reactivity for two different monoclonal antibodies. third, purified p112, like tm, acts as a cofactor for protein c activation. finally, two cdna clones identified with p112 polyclonal antiserum contain sequence identity with the known tm cdna sequence. quantitative analysis of tm (p112) expression using a two-site monoclonal antibody assay demonstrates that significantly higher levels of tm are found in lung in comparison with other highly vascularized organs, i.e. the kidney and liver. quantitative northern blot data coincides with the two-site assay data and demonstrates that the high level of tm expression in lung is not due to preferential binding of the monoclonal antibodies to lung tm but rather to increased production of tm mrna in the lung relative to other highly vascularized organs. it is suggested that expression of tm is highest in cells from continuous endothelium.
involvement of midbrain tectum neurokinin-mediated mechanisms in fear and anxiety the postsynaptic actions of substance p on rat midbrain periaqueductal grey (pag) neurons were examined using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in brain slices. substance p produced an inward current in a subpopulation (60%) of pag neurons. the substance p induced current was concentration dependent (ec50=27 nm) and was reduced by the nk1, nk2 and nk3 antagonists l-732,138 (20 microm), gr 159897 (3 microm) and sb 218795 (3 microm). the selective nk1, nk2 and nk3 agonists [sar9,met(o2)11]-substance p (100 nm), gr 64349 (300-500 nm) and senktide (300 nm) also produced inward currents in subpopulations of neurons. a greater proportion of substance p-sensitive neurons (70%) than substance p-insensitive neurons (31%) responded to the mu/delta opioid agonist met-enkephalin (10 microm). substance p reduced the outward current produced by met-enkephalin. the reversal potential of the substance p induced current varied from -5 mv to below -140 mv in the absence of met-enkephalin, and was -105 mv in the presence of met-enkephalin. these results indicate that substance p acts via nk1, nk2 and nk3 receptors to excite subpopulations of opioid-sensitive and insensitive pag neurons by increasing a non-selective cation conductance and by reducing a k+ current. in addition, substance p has anti-opioid actions that are largely mediated by a reduction in the opioid induced k+ current.
answer set programming with templates standard belief contraction assumes an underlying logic containing full classical propositional logic, but there are good reasons for considering contraction in less expressive logics. in this paper we focus on horn logic. in addition to being of interest in its own right, our choice is motivated by the use of horn logic in several areas, including ontology reasoning in description logics. we consider three versions of contraction: entailment-based and inconsistency-based contraction (e-contraction and i-contraction, resp.), introduced by delgrande for horn logic, and package contraction (p-contraction), studied by fuhrmann and hansson for the classical case. we show that the standard basic form of contraction, partial meet, is too strong in the horn case. we define more appropriate notions of basic contraction for all three types above, and provide associated representation results in terms of postulates. our results stand in contrast to delgrande's conjectures that orderly maxichoice is the appropriate contraction for both e- and i-contraction. our interest in p-contraction stems from its relationship with an important reasoning task in ontological reasoning: repairing the subsumption hierarchy in el. this is closely related to p-contraction with sets of basic horn clauses (horn clauses of the form p → q). we show that this restricted version of p-contraction can also be represented as i-contraction.
in vitro activation of chicken leukocytes and in vivo protection against salmonella enteritidis organ invasion and peritoneal s. enteritidis infection-induced mortality in neonatal chickens by immunostimulatory cpg oligodeoxynucleotide. this review summarizes recent evidence from knock-out mice on the role of reactive oxygen intermediates and reactive nitrogen intermediates (rni) in mammalian immunity. reflections on redundancy in immunity help explain an apparent paradox: the phagocyte oxidase and inducible nitric oxide synthase are each nonredundant, and yet also mutually redundant, in host defense. in combination, the contribution of these two enzymes appears to be greater than previously appreciated. the remainder of this review focuses on a relatively new field, the basis of microbial resistance to rni. experimental tuberculosis provides an important example of an extended, dynamic balance between host and pathogen in which rni play a major role. in diseases such as tuberculosis, a molecular understanding of host-pathogen interactions requires characterization of the defenses used by microbes against rni, analogous to our understanding of defenses against reactive oxygen intermediates. genetic and biochemical approaches have identified candidates for rni-resistance genes in mycobacterium tuberculosis and other pathogens.

a genome-wide survey of hd-zip genes in rice and analysis of drought-responsive family members hahb-4 is a member of the helianthusannuus (sunflower) subfamily i of hd-zip proteins that is transcriptionally regulated by water availability and abscisic acid. transgenic arabidopsis thaliana plants overexpressing this transcription factor (tf) exhibit a characteristic phenotype that includes a strong tolerance to water stress. here we show that this tf is a new component of ethylene signalling pathways, and that it induces a marked delay in senescence. plants overexpressing hahb-4 are less sensitive to external ethylene, enter the senescence pathway later and do not show the typical triple response. furthermore, transgenic plants expressing this gene under the control of its own inducible promoter showed an inverse correlation between ethylene sensitivity and hahb-4 levels. potential targets of hahb-4 were identified by comparing the transcriptome of hahb-4-transformed and wild-type plants using microarrays and quantitative rt-pcr. expression of this tf has a major repressive effect on genes related to ethylene synthesis, such as aco and sam, and on genes related to ethylene signalling, such as erf2 and erf5. expression studies in sunflower indicate that hahb-4 transcript levels are elevated in mature/senescent leaves. expression of hahb-4 is induced by ethylene, concomitantly with several genes homologous to the targets identified in the transcriptome analysis (ha-acoa and ha-acob). transient transformation of sunflower leaves demonstrated the action of hahb-4 in the regulation of ethylene-related genes. we propose that hahb-4 is involved in a novel conserved mechanism related to ethylene-mediated senescence that functions to improve desiccation tolerance.
design and evaluation of prophylactic interventions using infectious disease incidence data from close contact groups. for the first wave of pandemic influenza or a bioterrorist influenza attack, antiviral agents would be one of the few options to contain the epidemic in the united states until adequate supplies of vaccine were available. the authors use stochastic epidemic simulations to investigate the effectiveness of targeted antiviral prophylaxis to contain influenza. in this strategy, close contacts of suspected index influenza cases take antiviral agents prophylactically. the authors compare targeted antiviral prophylaxis with vaccination strategies. they model an influenza pandemic or bioterrorist attack for an agent similar to influenza a virus (h2n2) that caused the asian influenza pandemic of 1957-1958. in the absence of intervention, the model predicts an influenza illness attack rate of 33% of the population (95% confidence interval (ci): 30, 37) and an influenza death rate of 0.58 deaths/1,000 persons (95% cl: 0.4, 0.8). with the use of targeted antiviral prophylaxis, if 80% of the exposed persons maintained prophylaxis for up to 8 weeks, the epidemic would be contained, and the model predicts a reduction to an illness attack rate of 2% (95% cl: 0.2, 16) and a death rate of 0.04 deaths/1,000 persons (95% ci: 0.0003, 0.25). such antiviral prophylaxis is nearly as effective as vaccinating 80% of the population. vaccinating 80% of the children aged less than 19 years is almost as effective as vaccinating 80% of the population. targeted antiviral prophylaxis has potential as an effective measure for containing influenza until adequate quantities of vaccine are available.
persistent staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: an analysis of risk factors and outcomes. background the causes of persistent bacteremia (pb) due to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) are poorly understood. this investigation examined potential associations between pb with key clinical features and several in vitro bacterial genotypic and phenotypic characteristics, in isolates from 1 institution.   methods pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) relatedness, thrombin-induced platelet microbicidal protein (tpmp)-susceptibility phenotype, accessory gene regulator (agr) genotype and functionality (via delta-lysin production), and autolysis phenotypes were assessed in mrsa isolates from the bloodstream of 21 prospectively identified patients with pb (blood cultures positive after > or =7 days of therapy) and of 18 patients with resolving bacteremia (rb) (sterile blood cultures within the first 2-4 days of therapy) due to mrsa.   results the 2 groups had comparable baseline characteristics but differed in their clinical courses (e.g., endocarditis was more frequent in patients with pb than in those with rb [43% vs. 0%, respectively; p=.0016]); isolates from patients with pb exhibited higher rates of (1) survival in vitro after exposure to tpmp (22.4+/-14.8% vs. 11.6+/-6.5%, respectively; p=.005); (2) defective delta-lysin production (71.4% vs. 38.9%, respectively; p=.057); (3) non-agr genotype ii profile (100% vs. 77.8%, respectively; p=.037); and (4) overrepresentation of a specific pfge genotype (85.7% vs. 44.4%, respectively; p=.015).   conclusions isolates from patients with pb differed from those in patients with rb, in several in vitro characteristics. further studies will be necessary to define how these factors might affect clinical outcome.

a novel human detection approach based on depth map via kinect conventional human detection is mostly done in images taken by visible-light cameras. these methods imitate the detection process that human use. they use features based on gradients, such as histograms of oriented gradients (hog), or extract interest points in the image, such as scale-invariant feature transform (sift), etc. in this paper, we present a novel human detection method using depth information taken by the kinect for xbox 360. we propose a model based approach, which detects humans using a 2-d head contour model and a 3-d head surface model. we propose a segmentation scheme to segment the human from his/her surroundings and extract the whole contours of the figure based on our detection point. we also explore the tracking algorithm based on our detection result. the methods are tested on our database taken by the kinect in our lab and present superior results.
an amish founder mutation disrupts a pi(3)p-whamm-arp2/3 complex–driven autophagosomal remodeling pathway a fundamental question regarding autophagosome formation is how the shape of the double-membrane autophagosomal vesicle is generated. here we show that in mammalian cells assembly of an actin scaffold inside the isolation membrane (the autophagosomal precursor) is essential for autophagosomal membrane shaping. actin filaments are depolymerized shortly after starvation and actin is assembled into a network within the isolation membrane. when formation of actin puncta is disrupted by an actin polymerization inhibitor or by knocking down the actin-capping protein capzβ, isolation membranes and omegasomes collapse into mixed-membrane bundles. formation of actin puncta is ptdins(3)p dependent, and inhibition of ptdins(3)p formation by treating cells with the pi(3)k inhibitor 3-ma, or by knocking down beclin-1, abolishes the formation of actin puncta. binding of capz to ptdins(3)p, which is enriched in omegasomes, stimulates actin polymerization. our findings illuminate the mechanism underlying autophagosomal membrane shaping and provide key insights into how autophagosomes are formed.
parallel input channels to mouse primary visual cortex from the moment the mouse model took center stage for studies of cortical arealization and map formation, there was an urgent need for methods to identify areal borders in the living animal. the need was met in part by intrinsic optical signal imaging, which has been successfully applied to map topographic representations in primary visual, auditory and somatosensory cortex. however, the challenge remains to register these maps to the underlying structure. this is especially important for studies of the mouse brain in which cortical areas are often only a few hundred microns across. here, we show that in visual cortex neuronal tracing with fluororuby and fluoroemerald can be used for transcranial imaging through the intact skull of callosal connections from the opposite side of the brain, and for mapping of topographic striate-extrastriate cortical pathways in living mice. because callosal connections are important landmarks for cortical areas, the new method will allow registration of functional maps to underlying structures and facilitate targeted single-unit recordings in identified cortical areas.
environment-sensitive quinolone demonstrating long-lived fluorescence and unusually slow excited-state intramolecular proton transfer kinetics. by using four labels of the 3-hydroxyflavone family displaying selective sensitivity to hydrogen bond (hb) donors and poor response to other polar molecules, we developed an approach for measuring local water concentration [h(2)o](l) (or partial volume of water: w(a) = [h(2)o](l)/55.6) in the label surrounding both in solvent mixtures and in biomolecules by the intensity ratio of two emissive forms of the label, n*/t*. using a series of binary water/solvent mixtures with limited preferential solvation effects, a linear dependence of log(n*/t*) on the local concentration of hb donor was obtained and then used as a calibration curve for estimating the w(a) values in the surroundings of the probes conjugated to biomolecules. by this approach, we estimated the hydration of the labels in different peptides and their complexes with dnas. we found that w(a) values for the label at the peptide n-terminus are lower (0.63-0.91) than for free labels and depend strongly on the nature of the n-terminal amino acid. when complexed with different dnas, the estimated hydration of the labels conjugated to the labeled peptides was much lower (w(a) = 0-0.47) and depended on the dna nature and linker-label structure. thus, the elaborated method allows a site-specific evaluation of hydration at the surface of a biomolecule through the determination of the partial volume of water. we believe the developed procedure can be successfully applied for monitoring hydration at the surface of any biomolecule or nanostructure.
artificial reefs for sea cucumber aquaculture confirmed as settlement substrates of the moon jellyfish aurelia coerulea jellyfish (cnidaria, scyphozoa) blooms appear to be increasing in both intensity and frequency in many coastal areas worldwide, due to multiple hypothesized anthropogenic stressors. here, we propose that the proliferation of artificial structures – associated with (1) the exponential growth in shipping, aquaculture, and other coastal industries, and (2) coastal protection (collectively, “ocean sprawl”) – provides habitat for jellyfish polyps and may be an important driver of the global increase in jellyfish blooms. however, the habitat of the benthic polyps that commonly result in coastal jellyfish blooms has remained elusive, limiting our understanding of the drivers of these blooms. support for the hypothesized role of ocean sprawl in promoting jellyfish blooms is provided by observations and experimental evidence demonstrating that jellyfish larvae settle in large numbers on artificial structures in coastal waters and develop into dense concentrations of jellyfish-producing polyps.
convex optimization and utility theory, new trends in vlsi circuit layout the "quadratic placement" methodology is rooted in [module placement based on resistive network optimization, proud: a sea-of-gate placement algorithm, a combined force and cut algorithm for hierarchical vlsi layout]and is reputedly used in many commercial and in-house tools forplacement of standard-cell and gate-array designs. the methodologyiterates between two basic steps: solving sparse systems oflinear equations, and repartitioning. this work dissects the implementationand motivations for quadratic placement. we firstshow that (i) krylov subspace engines for solving sparse systemsof linear equations are more effective than the traditional successiveover-relaxation (sor) engine [a unified approach to partitioning and placement] and (ii) order convergence criteriacan maintain solution quality while using substantially fewersolver iterations. we then discuss the motivations and relevanceof the quadratic placement approach, in the context of past and futurealgorithmic technology, performance requirements, and designmethodology. we provide evidence that the use of numerical linearsystems solvers with quadratic wirelength objective may be due tothe pre-1990's weakness of min-cut partitioners, i.e., numerical engineswere needed to provide helpful hints to min-cut partitioners.finally, we note emerging methodology drivers in deep-submicrondesign that may require new placement approaches to the placement problem.
markers of lutein and zeaxanthin status in two age groups of men and women: dietary intake, serum concentrations, lipid profile and macular pigment optical density age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in the elderly, is a degenerative condition of the macula characterized by death or dysfunction of the photoreceptors. with the aging population growing, the incidence of age-related macular degeneration is expected to increase. this raises concern about the future of visual dysfunction related falls and the resulting injuries in the elderly population. lutein and zeaxanthin are macular pigments that may play a role in reducing the development and progression of age-related macular degeneration. evidence is accumulating on the consumption of lutein and zeaxanthin (in whole food or supplemental form), the resulting concentrations in the serum, and tissue distribution throughout the body, particularly in the retina. lutein and zeaxanthin intake increases serum concentrations which in turn increases macular pigment density. existing literature focuses on factors affecting macular pigment density, functions of lutein and zeaxanthin as blue-light filters and antioxidants, and risk factors associated with age-related macular degeneration. few studies have focused on the impact of dietary lutein and zeaxanthin on retinal function and the potential to preserve vision and prevent further degeneration. this presents an opportunity for further research to determine an effective dose that delays the progression of age-related macular degeneration.
the six metal binding domains in human copper transporter, atp7b: molecular biophysics and disease-causing mutations backgroundwilson﻿'s disease ﻿with﻿ osseomuscular type is a rare condition, which often lacks typical hepatic and neurological symptoms and causes misdiagnoses easily. during the past 10 years, eight chinese patients of osseomuscular type of wilson's disease were identified in our clinic.methodsclinical information was gathered from medical records and follow-ups. the genetic testing was performed in each patient. serum ceruloplasmin, kayser-fleischer rings, liver function, brain magnetic resonance imaging and abdominal ultrasonography were also evaluated.resultsthe median age of onset is 12 years of age. the patients had their initial musculoskeletal conditions with arthralgia or joint deformity, while the hepatic or neurologic signs were minimal. most patients (6/8) eventually developed clinical neurological symptoms afterwards with a median interval of 36 months. all of them had normal liver function and low serum ceruloplasmin (<0.1 g/l). most patients (6/8) present with kayser-fleischer rings and abnormal hepatic ultrasonography. the arthralgia was resolved with copper chelation therapy.conclusionswilson’s disease with osseomuscular type occurs without typical hepatic or neurological symptoms, which makes the clinical diagnosis challenging. serum ceruloplasmin, abdominal ultrasonography, ophthalmic examination and genetic testing help to establish the diagnosis. early diagnosis can initiate an effective treatment and prevent the further damage.
how are global value chains fragmented and extended in china's domestic production networks? this article analyzes the distribution of financial value from innovation in the global supply chains of ipods and notebook computers. we find that apple has captured a great deal of value from the innovation embodied in the ipod, while notebook makers capture a more modest share of the value from pc innovation. in order to understand these differences, we employ concepts from theories of innovation and industrial organization, finding significant roles for industry evolution, complementary assets, appropriability, system integration, and bargaining power. copyright 2010 the author 2009. published by oxford university press on behalf of associazione icc. all rights reserved., oxford university press.

interhemispheric and intrahemispheric connectivity and manual skills in children with unilateral cerebral palsy objective to examine the reorganisation of the somatosensory system after early brain lesions.   methods we studied 12 young patients with congenital hemiplegia. causative lesions were brain malformations, periventricular injuries and cortico-subcortical lesions. we explored the somatosensory system using evoked potentials, fmri during sensory stimulation and clinical assessment of sensory function. to correlate sensory and motor function, we also performed transcranial magnetic stimulation, fmri of hand movement and assessment of motor function by means of melbourne test.   results eleven patients showed a perilesional reorganisation of primary somatosensory function, as expressed by short latency potentials following stimulation of the paretic hand; in a remaining patient, delayed latency responses (n27.1) were only elicited over the ipsilateral undamaged hemisphere. five of the eleven patients with perilesional somatosensory representation of the affected hand showed contralesional shifting of motor function, thus exhibiting sensory-motor dissociation. significant correlation was found between sensory deficit and fmri activation during sensory stimulation.   conclusions in subjects with early brain lesions, somato-sensory function is generally reorganised within the affected hemisphere. a contralesional shifting is uncommon and poorly efficient in function restoration.   significance this study confirms and further explores the difference in reorganisation capabilities of the motor and sensory system following early brain injury of different etiologies and timing.
climatic forcing on channel profiles in the eastern cordillera of the coroico region, bolivia the bolivian andes flank one of earth’s major topographic features and dominate sediment input into the amazon basin. millennial-scale erosion rates and dominant controls on erosion patterns in this range are poorly known. to define these patterns, we present 48 erosion rate estimates, derived from analysis of in situ 10 be in quartz-bearing alluvium collected from the upper beni river basin. erosion rates, corrected for the non-uniform distribution of quartz in the sample basins, range from 0·04 mm a −1 to 1·35 mm a −1 and thus integrate over 10 2 ‐10 4 years. mean and modal values are 0·42 (standard deviation: 0·29) and 0·2‐0·4 mm a −1 respectively, within the range of long-term average erosion rates in this area derived from apatite fission track thermochronology (0·1‐0·6 mm a −1 ). hence, our data do not record any significant variation in erosion rate over the last several million years. mean and modal short-term erosion rates for the andes are an order of magnitude lower than rates in the ganges river headwaters in the high himalaya and an order of magnitude greater than rates typical of the european alps. in the upper beni river region of the bolivian andes, short-term, basin-averaged erosion rates correlate with normalized channel steepness index, a metric of relative channel gradient corrected for drainage area. neither normalized channel steepness index nor basin-averaged erosion rate shows strong correlation with mean basin hillslope gradient or mean basin local relief because many hillslopes in the upper beni river region are at threshold values of slope and local relief. patterns of normalized channel steepness index appear primarily to reflect tectonic patterns and transient adjustment to those patterns by channel networks. climate and lithology do not appear to exert first-order controls on patterns of basin-averaged erosion rates in the bolivian andes. copyright © 2005 john wiley & sons, ltd.
structural plasticity in human heterochromatin protein 1β the structure of a chromatin binding domain from mouse chromatin modifier protein 1 (momod1) was determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy. the protein consists of an n‐terminal three‐stranded anti‐parallel β‐sheet which folds against a c‐terminal α‐helix. the structure reveals an unexpected homology to two archaebacterial dna binding proteins which are also involved in chromatin structure. structural comparisons suggest that chromo domains, of which more than 40 are now known, act as protein interaction motifs and that the momod1 protein acts as an adaptor mediating interactions between different proteins.
tumor suppressive protein phosphatases in human cancer: emerging targets for therapeutic intervention and tumor stratification. protein tyrosine‐phosphatases (ptps) play important roles in various biological processes. deregulation in ptp function has been implicated in carcinogenesis and tumour progression in many cancer types. however, the role of protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type b (ptprb) in non‐small‐cell lung cancer (nsclc) tumorigenesis has not been investigated. lentiviral vector expressing ptprb cdna or shrna was infected into a549 and h1299 cell lines, followed by cell proliferation, colony formation, soft agar and invasion assays. a549 xenograft mouse model was used to evaluate in vivo function of ptprb. quantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used to measure ptprb expression in nsclc patient samples. kaplan meier analysis was performed to assess association between ptprb expression and patient overall survival (os). multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate prognostic significance of ptprb. overexpression of ptprb reduced cell proliferation rate, colony formation efficiency, soft agar growth and cell invasion in a549 and h1299 cells, as well as tumour growth rate in a549 xenograft. knockdown of ptprb increased src phosphorylation and cell invasion, which was reversed by src inhibitor pp2. additionally, ptprb was down‐regulated in nsclc patient and was associated with patient os. ptprb regulates src phosphorylation and tumorigenesis in nsclc. ptprb may serve as an independent prognostic biomarker for nsclc patients.
embedded effort indicators on the california verbal learning test – second edition (cvlt–ii): an attempted cross-validation this study determined whether performance patterns on the california verbal learning test-ii (cvlt-ii) could differentiate participants with traumatic brain injury (tbi) showing adequate effort from those with mild tbi exhibiting poor effort using a case-control design. the tbi group consisted of 124 persons with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (tbi). the poor effort group consisted of 77 persons with mild head injury who were involved in litigation (lg) and failed at least one stand-alone symptom validity measure (svt) and also either a second svt or an effort indicator embedded within a standard clinical test. a total of 18 cvlt-ii variables were investigated using bayesian model averaging (bma) for logistic regression to determine which variables best differentiated the groups. the cvlt-ii variables having the most support were long-delay free recall, total recognition discriminability (d′), and total recall discriminability.
optical multilayers as a tool for visualizing special relativity wigner rotations and iwasawa decompositions are manifestations of the internal space-time symmetries of massive and massless particles, respectively. it is shown to be possible to produce combinations of optical filters which exhibit transformations corresponding to wigner rotations and iwasawa decompositions. this is possible because the combined effects of rotation, phase-shift, and attenuation filters lead to transformation matrices of the six-parameter lorentz group applicable to jones vectors and stokes parameters for polarized light waves. the symmetry transformations in special relativity lead to a set of experiments which can be performed in optics laboratories.

nighttime ambulatory blood pressure is associated with atrial remodelling and neurohormonal activation in patients with idiopathic atrial fibrillation. abstract—incidence, determinants, and outcome of atrial fibrillation in hypertensive subjects are incompletely known. we followed for up to 16 years 2482 initially untreated subjects with essential hypertension. at entry, all subjects were in sinus rhythm. subjects with valvular heart disease, coronary artery disease, preexcitation syndrome, thyroid disorders, or lung disease were excluded. during follow-up, a first episode of atrial fibrillation occurred in 61 subjects at a rate of 0.46 per 100 person-years. at entry, subjects with future atrial fibrillation differed (all p <0.05) from those without by age (59 versus 51 years), office, and 24-hour systolic blood pressure (165 and 144 versus 157 and 137 mm hg, respectively), left ventricular mass (58 versus 49 g/height[m]2.7), and left atrial diameter (3.89 versus 3.56 cm). age and left ventricular mass (both p <0.001) were the sole independent predictors of atrial fibrillation. for every 1 standard deviation increase in left ventricular mass, the risk of atrial fibrillation was increased 1.20 times (95% ci, 1.07 to 1.34). atrial fibrillation became chronic in 33% of subjects. age, left ventricular mass, and left atrial diameter (all p <0.01) were independent predictors of chronic atrial fibrillation. ischemic stroke occurred at a rate of 2.7% and 4.6% per year, respectively, among subjects with paroxysmal and chronic atrial fibrillation. these data indicate that in hypertensive subjects with sinus rhythm and no other major predisposing conditions, risk of atrial fibrillation increases with age and left ventricular mass. increased left atrial size predisposes to chronicization of atrial fibrillation.
neighborhood context and immigrant children's physical activity. context research examining the association between environmental attributes and physical activity among youth is growing. an updated review of literature is needed to summarize the current evidence base, and to inform policies and environmental interventions to promote active lifestyles among young people.   evidence acquisition a literature search was conducted using the active living research (alr) literature database, an online database that codes study characteristics and results of published papers on built/social environment and physical activity/obesity/sedentary behavior. papers in the alr database were identified through pubmed, web of science, and sportdiscus using systematically developed and expert-validated search protocols. for the current review, additional inclusion criteria were used to select observational, quantitative studies among youth aged 3-18 years.   evidence synthesis papers were categorized by design features, sample characteristics, and measurement mode. relevant results were summarized, stratified by age (children or adolescents) and mode of measurement (objective or perceived) for environmental attributes and physical activity. percentage of significant results was calculated.   conclusions mode of measurement greatly influenced the consistency of associations between environmental attributes and youth physical activity. for both children and adolescents, the most consistent associations involved objectively measured environmental attributes and reported physical activity. the most supported correlates for children were walkability, traffic speed/volume, access/proximity to recreation facilities, land-use mix, and residential density. the most supported correlates for adolescents were land-use mix and residential density. these findings support several recommendations for policy and environmental change from such groups as the iom and national physical activity plan.
enhancing scholarly use of digital libraries: a comparative survey and review of bibliographic metadata ontologies in philosophy of language, the phenomena fundamental to human communication are routinely modeled in ways that do not require commitment to a concept of “information” separate from those of “data,” “meaning,” “communication,” “knowledge,” and “relevance” (inter alia). a taxonomy of conceptions of information may be developed that relies on commonly drawn philosophical distinctions (between linguistic, mental, and physical entities, between objects and events, and between particulars and universals); in such a taxonomy, no category requires the label “information” in order to be differentiated from others. it is suggested that a conception of information-as-relevance is currently the most productive of advances in theoretical information studies.

oxidative stress in mouse liver caused by dietary amino acid deprivation: protective effect of methionine two-dimensional non-equilibrium ph gel electrophoresis (2d-nephge) analysis was used to evaluate the effects of dietary protein depletion on the protein composition of mouse liver cytosol. analysing the cytosol from both normal and protein depleted liver, the position in gels of more than three hundred protein spots was determined. after 5 days of protein depletion, about 20% of the spots either increased or decreased more than 2 fold. five spots of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) were recognised by specific antibodies. the glutathione s-transferase (gsts) subunits yb1, yc and yf were identified by the simultaneous analysis of both glutathione-binding cytosolic proteins and the corresponding standards. as estimated by internal optical density (iod) of spots, the changes caused by protein depletion in gapdh and gst subunit contents were similar to those obtained by other methods. by means of mass spectrometric analysis of tryptic peptides generated from spots and/or comparison of two-dimensional gel electrophoretic patterns, carbonic anhydrase iii (caiii), cu, zn superoxide dismutase (cuznsod) and a cytochrome p450 cytosolic protein (cyt p450) were identified. these three proteins, as well as gsts, are related with intracellular detoxification and free radical scavenging systems. their contents were regulated by dietary protein restriction in a manner indicative of diminished liver defence against oxidising agents.
association between variants in the genes for adiponectin and its receptors with insulin resistance syndrome (irs)-related phenotypes in mexican americans the adiponectin receptors, adipor1 and adipor2, are thought to transmit the insulin-sensitizing, anti-inflammatory, and atheroprotective effects of adiponectin. in this study, we examined whether adipor mrna expression in human myotubes correlates with in vivo measures of insulin sensitivity. myotubes from 40 metabolically characterized donors expressed 1.8-fold more adipor1 than adipor2 mrna (588 +/- 35 vs. 321 +/- 39 fg/microg total rna). moreover, the expression levels of both receptors correlated with each other (r = 0.45, p < 0.01). adipor1 mrna expression was positively correlated with in vivo insulin and c-peptide concentrations, first-phase insulin secretion, and plasma triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations before and after adjustment for sex, age, waist-to-hip ratio, and body fat. expression of adipor2 mrna clearly associated only with plasma triglyceride concentrations. in multivariate linear regression models, mrna expression of adipor1, but not adipor2, was a determinant of first-phase insulin secretion independent of insulin sensitivity and body fat. finally, insulin did not directly modify myotube adipor1 mrna expression in vitro. in conclusion, we provide evidence that myotube mrna levels of both receptors are associated with distinct metabolic functions but not with insulin sensitivity. adipor1, but not adipor2, expression correlated with insulin secretion. the molecular nature of this link between muscle and beta-cells needs to be further clarified.
lindane toxicity in a 7 year old boy. treatment of head louse infection is primarily through topical insecticides. however, there is growing evidence of resistance. a representative population sample was tested using biochemical and molecular methods; it was shown that, in wales, treatments containing pyrethroids are likely to be less effective in controlling head louse infection than those containing organophosphates.
evolution of virulence in emerging epidemics optimality models assume that phenotypes evolve by natural selection largely independently of underlying genetic mechanisms. this neglect of genetic mechanisms is considered an advantage by some evolutionary biologists but a fatal flaw by others. the controversy has gone unresolved, in part, from a lack of complex phenotypes that meet optimality criteria and for which the underlying genetic mechanisms are known. here, we look at both perspectives for lysis time in bacteriophages. we find that the basic assumptions of the optimality model are compatible with the genetic details, but the optimality model is limited in its ability to accommodate lysis time plasticity because the mechanistic underpinnings of plasticity are poorly known.
expanded, but not regulated: ambiguity in home-care policy in ireland. this article describes and evaluates cash-for-care programmes for older people in four european countries, namely home-care grants in ireland, direct payments in the united kingdom (england), service vouchers in finland and personal budgets in the netherlands. the purpose is to raise understanding of the background and reasons for the introduction of cash-for-care programmes and their impact on the countries' care regimes. it is argued that while the motives for introducing cash-for-care programmes in the four countries are similar, namely to promote choice and autonomy, to plug gaps in existing provision, to create jobs, and to promote efficiency, cost savings and domiciliary care, the relative importance of these goals varies. current cash-for-care programmes have comparatively modest coverage as compared with direct service provision and provide no more than an optional, supplementary source of care in three of the studied countries. cash-for-care schemes have not radically transformed the care regimes in finland, the netherlands or the united kingdom. in ireland, however, the restricted availability of alternative forms of formal service provision means that the expansion of cash-for-care might shift care provision significantly towards private provision and financing.
n-meander scanning trace a method for the on-chip bandwidth reduction this work presents a domain-specific memory subsystem based on a two-level memory hierarchy. it targets the application domain of video post-processing applications including video enhancement and format conversion. these applications are based on motion compensation and/or broad class of content adaptive filtering to provide the highest quality of pictures. our approach meets the required performance and has sufficient flexibility for the application domain. it especially aims at the implementation-wise most challenging applications: compute-intensive and bandwidth-demanding applications that provide the highest quality at high picture resolutions. the lowest level of the memory hierarchy, closest to the processing element, the l0 scratchpad, is organized specifically to enable fast retrieval of an arbitrarily positioned 2-d block of pixels to the processing element. to guarantee the performance, most of its addressing logic is hardwired, leaving a user a set of api for initialization and storing/loading the data to/from the l0 scratchpad. the next level of the memory hierarchy, the l1 scratchpad, minimizes the off-chip memory bandwidth requirements. the l1 scratchpad is organized specifically to enable efficient aligned block-based accesses. with lower data rates compared to the l0 scratchpad and aligned block access, software-based addressing is used to enable full flexibility. the two-level memory hierarchy exploits prefetching to further improve the performance.
recognizing rna structural motifs in ht-selex data for ribosomal protein s15 the 16s rrna‐binding ribosomal protein s15 is a key component in the assembly of the small ribosomal subunit in bacteria. we have shown that s15 from the extreme thermophile thermus thermophilus represses the translation of its own mrna in vitro, by interacting with the leader segment of its mrna. the s15 mrna‐binding site was characterized by footprinting experiments, deletion analysis and site‐directed mutagenesis. s15 binding triggers a conformational rearrangement of its mrna into a fold that mimics the conserved three‐way junction of the s15 rrna‐binding site. this conformational change masks the ribosome entry site, as demonstrated by direct competition between the ribosomal subunit and s15 for mrna binding. a comparison of the t.thermophilus and escherichia coli regulation systems reveals that the two regulatory mrna targets do not share any similarity and that the mechanisms of translational inhibition are different. our results highlight an astonishing plasticity of mrna in its ability to adapt to evolutionary constraints, that contrasts with the extreme conservation of the rrna‐binding site.
trans-splenic access for portal venous interventions in children: do benefits outweigh risks? purpose to present methods and results of interventional treatment of children with portal hypertension (ph) secondary to portal vein occlusion (pvo).   material and methods five children, four boys and one girl, 8 - 14 years old, with symptomatic ph secondary to pvo were treated. all children had one or more episodes of bleeding from oesophageal varices, enlarged spleen and thrombocytopenia. partial embolisation of the spleen was performed in four children. attempts to recanalize the occluded part of the portal vein were done in all children using transjugular (n = 4), transhepatic (n = 4) and transsplenic (n = 3) approaches.   results all procedures were carried out without serious complications and were followed by normalisation of the platelet count, decrease in splenic size and disappearance of bleeding. recanalisation of the occluded portal vein with a stent was possible in one child and partial stent recanalisation was possible in another child. transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (tips) with partly extrahepatic, intraperitoneal route was created in one patient. all children were scheduled for follow-up. during the observation time of 22 months (5 - 46 months), additional balloon dilation and placement of new stents were necessary in two children.   conclusion interventional procedures are valuable in the treatment of children with symptoms secondary to pvo. treatment should be customized and scheduled follow-ups of the patients are necessary.
what is the daily practice of mechanical ventilation in pediatric intensive care units? a multicenter study in a retrospective chart review of cases of adult respiratory distress syndrome in our pediatric intensive care unit from 1987 to 1990, we attempted to identify the physiologic variables predictive of death. we identified 44 children with adult respiratory distress syndrome; the mortality rate was 75%. we found significant differences between survivors and nonsurvivors in intrapulmonary venous admixture (qsp/qt), mean airway pressure (paw), alveolar-arterial oxygen tension difference (p(a-a)o2), oxygenation index, and peak inspirator pressure; qsp/qt greater than 0.5, paw greater than 23 cm h2o, and p(a-a)o2 greater than 470 mm hg were 93%, 90%, and 81% predictive of death, respectively, in this study population. sensitivity and specificity were enhanced when we linked multiple predictors, but this linkage was seldom successful because few patients had more than one positive predictor. we propose to use the individual predictors that we have identified as randomization criteria in a future trial of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for pediatric cases of adult respiratory distress syndrome.
factors affecting unmet need for family planning in southern nations, nationalities and peoples region, ethiopia the southern nations, nationalities, and people's region of ethiopia (snnpr) is home to 11 million people constituting more than 45 language and ethnic groups, most of whom live in extremely poor rural communities. data for currently married, fecund women aged 15-49 from demographic surveys conducted in the snnpr in 1990 and 1997 are used to investigate contraceptive knowledge and communication, and the use and future need for family planning services in this population. this study focuses on how these processes are affected by household organization and women's status, and on their implications for population policies and programs. considerations of the implications of these results for understanding the fertility transition of a highly diverse african population under severe stress are presented. although household extension and polygamy characterize one-third of the women sampled, they do not affect the women's contraceptive behavior. women's literacy and autonomy are, by far, the most significant forces in the movement toward lower fertility in the region.
assessment of lead ecotoxicity in water using the amphibian larvae (xenopus laevis) and preliminary study of its immobilization in meat and bone meal combustion residues pickerel frogs (rana palustris) and bullfrogs (rana catesbeiana) were exposed from the egg stage to lead-contaminated surface water from a trap and skeet range. seven experimental treatments were employed: 25, 50, 75 and 100% range water, 100% range water plus a chelating agent (sodium citrate), control water and control water plus chelating agent. total lead concentrations in 100% range water treatments varied from 840-3150 microg litre(-1), with the filterable form accounting for approximately 4-5% of the total. hatching was not affected in either species (p > 0.2). there were highly significant differences in mortality among treatments for r. palustris (p = 0.0001), with tadpoles exhibiting 100 and 98% mortality after 10 d of exposure to 100 and 75% range water, respectively. mortality in the 100% range water + citrate treatment was similar to controls (p > 0.05). there were no significant differences in mortality among treatments for r. catesbeiana after 10 d of exposure (p = 0.7119). exposure to lead in the range water did not adversely affect the growth of surviving r. palustris or r. catesbeiana tadpoles after 14 weeks and 10 weeks, respectively. in both species, the intestinal mucosa in tadpoles exposed to range water was reduced in thickness. scanning electron micrographs of r. palustris tadpoles that died in 100% range water revealed stunted tail growth, incurvation of the spine, hydropsy and generally reduced body size.
the role of mtor signaling in the regulation of protein synthesis and muscle mass during immobilization in mice non‐technical summary  chronic mechanical loading (cml) of skeletal muscle induces growth and this effect can be blocked by the drug rapamycin. rapamycin is considered to be a highly specific inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor), and thus, many have concluded that mtor plays a key role in cml‐induced growth. however, direct evidence that mtor confers the cml‐induced activation of growth promoting events such as hypertrophy, hyperplasia and ribosome biogenesis is lacking. this study addressed that gap in knowledge by using a specialized line of transgenic mice. surprisingly, the results indicate that only a few of the growth promoting events induced by cml are fully dependent on mtor signalling (e.g. hypertrophy). these results advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate skeletal muscle mass and should help future studies aimed at identifying targets for therapies that can prevent the loss of muscle mass during conditions such as bedrest, immobilization, and ageing.
the effect of dietary fat intake on hepatic gene expression in lg/j and sm/j mice objective to examine the differential response of obesity- and diabetes-related traits to a high- or low-fat diet in lg/j and sm/j mice. we also examined food consumption in these strains.   research methods and procedures mice were placed on a high- or low-fat diet after weaning. animals were weighed once per week and subjected to glucose tolerance tests at 20 weeks. at sacrifice, fat pads and internal organs were removed along with serum samples. for food consumption, lg/j and sm/j mice of each sex were assigned to a high-fat or low-fat diet after reaching maturity. mice were weighed three times per week, and food consumed was determined by subtraction.   results lg/j animals consume more total food, but sm/j animals consume more food per gram of body weight. lg/j mice grow faster to 10 weeks but slower from 10 to 20 weeks, have higher cholesterol and free fatty acid levels, and have lower basal glucose levels and better response to a glucose challenge than sm/j mice. for most traits, sm/j mice respond more strongly to a high-fat diet than lg/j mice, including body weight and growth, basal glucose levels, organ weights, fat distribution, and circulating triglycerides and cholesterol levels.   discussion obesity-related phenotypes, as well as response to increased dietary fat, differ genetically between lg/j and sm/j and can, therefore, be mapped. this study indicates that the cross of sm/j and lg/j mice would be an excellent model system for the study of gene-by-diet interaction in obesity.

enhanced hybrid model for electricity load forecast through artificial neural network and jaya algorithm artificial neural network (ann) has been used for many years in sectors and disciplines like medical science, defence industry, robotics, electronics, economy, forecasts, etc. the learning property of ann in solving nonlinear and complex problems called for its application to forecasting problems. this report present the development of an ann based short-term load forecasting model for the 132/33kv sub- station, kano, nigeria. the recorded daily load profile with a lead time of 1-24 hours for the year 2005 was obtained from the utility company. the levenberg-marquardt optimization technique which has one of the best learning rates was used as a back propagation algorithm for the multilayer feed forward ann model using matlab ® r2008b ann toolbox. experiences gained during the development of the model regarding the selection of the input variables, the ann structure, and the training parameters are described. the forecasted next day 24 hourly peak loads are obtained based on the stationary output of the ann with a performance mean squared error (mse) of ૞.ૡ૝ࢋ ૟ and compares favorably with the actual power utility data. the results have shown that the proposed technique is robust in forecasting future load demands for the daily operational planning of power system distribution sub-stations in nigeria.
adipose-derived stem cells differentiate into a schwann cell phenotype and promote neurite outgrowth in vitro ©2005 british editorial society of bone and joint surgery doi:10.1302/0301-620x.87b10. 16700 $2.00 j bone joint surg [br] 2005;87-b:1309-19. peripheral nerve injuries, particularly in the upper limb, may have devastating consequences. the outcome of injury is determined by the amount of cellular damage, and by variables which include the site of the lesion, the degree of disruption of the connective-tissue sheaths that surround the nerve, the extent of associated injuries, particularly vascular injuries (fig. 1), and the age and health of the patient. meticulous surgical repair cannot guarantee full functional recovery because the surgeon does not control the ‘biological battlefield’ which rages inside a damaged nerve. 1 therapeutic manipulation of the response to injury at the molecular level has the potential to keep more neurones alive, encourage their axons to cross longer interstump gaps, to maximise the accuracy of target re-innervation and to manage neuropathic pain. for now, these objectives remain aspirational – they are predicated on a more detailed understanding of the way in which the peripheral nervous system responds to injury than is presently available. this brief update on the peripheral arm of the response to injury in the peripheral nervous system highlights areas where translational research may prove to be beneficial, for information on axotomy-related central phenomena, the reader is referred to earlier reviews. 2-4
abnormal insula functional network is associated with episodic memory decline in amnestic mild cognitive impairment alzheimer's disease (ad) is a neurodegenerative disorder that prominently affects cerebral connectivity. assessing the functional connectivity at rest, recent functional mri (fmri) studies reported on the existence of resting-state networks (rsns). rsns are characterized by spatially coherent, spontaneous fluctuations in the blood oxygen level-dependent signal and are made up of regional patterns commonly involved in functions such as sensory, attention, or default mode processing. in ad, the default mode network (dmn) is affected by reduced functional connectivity and atrophy. in this work, we analyzed functional and structural mri data from healthy elderly (n = 16) and patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (amci) (n = 24), a syndrome of high risk for developing ad. two questions were addressed: (i) are any rsns altered in amci? (ii) do changes in functional connectivity relate to possible structural changes? independent component analysis of resting-state fmri data identified eight spatially consistent rsns. only selected areas of the dmn and the executive attention network demonstrated reduced network-related activity in the patient group. voxel-based morphometry revealed atrophy in both medial temporal lobes (mtl) of the patients. the functional connectivity between both hippocampi in the mtls and the posterior cingulate of the dmn was present in healthy controls but absent in patients. we conclude that in individuals at risk for ad, a specific subset of rsns is altered, likely representing effects of ongoing early neurodegeneration. we interpret our finding as a proof of principle, demonstrating that functional brain disorders can be characterized by functional-disconnectivity profiles of rsns.
pediatric visceral leishmaniasis in northwest of iran bacterial superinfection is one of the major complications leading to death in patients with visceral leishmaniasis. we studied the frequency and type of bacterial infection in 54 patients admitted to hospital with visceral leishmaniasis. the patients were children who ranged in age from 3 1/2 months to 7 years. bacterial infections were found in 22 (41%) of the patients. bacteria were isolated in patients with pneumonia, septicaemia, otitis media, urinary tract infections and skin infections. enterobacteriaceae were the most common bacterial agents isolated. in infants with visceral leishmaniasis, fatal bacterial infections can be accompanied by nonspecific signs and symptoms. thus, it is important to initiate antibiotic treatment early.
rab5-family guanine nucleotide exchange factors bind retromer and promote its recruitment to endosomes sorting nexins are a large family of evolutionarily conserved phosphoinositide-binding proteins that have fundamental roles in orchestrating cargo sorting through the membranous maze that is the endosomal network. one ancient group of complexes that contain sorting nexins is the retromer. here we discuss how retromer complexes regulate endosomal sorting, and describe how this is generating exciting new insight into the central role played by endosomal sorting in development and homeostasis of normal tissues.
age-associated and cell-type-specific neurofibrillary pathology in transgenic mice expressing the human midsized neurofilament subunit a lambda gtii expression library was prepared from rat brain and screened with a polyclonal antiserum, which recognizes both nf-h and nf- m. an nf-m cdna clone (pnf-m3c = 1.6 kb) was isolated and characterized. the fusion protein of nf-m3c, when used as an affinity matrix for the anti-neurofilament serum, isolated a subpopulation of antibodies specific for nf-m. northern analysis demonstrates a single band of approximately 3000 nt and a constant message level for nf-m during postnatal development from postnatal day 0 (po) to adulthood. using pnf-m3c as a probe, a second cdna clone was isolated from a lambda gtii rat brain expression library (pnf-m2d = 2.7 kb). the 2 clones were sequenced and pnf-m2d was found to encode the entire rat nf- m protein. the calculated molecular weight is 95,600, which is only 65% of the molecular weight determined by sds-page. the amino acid sequence of rat nf-m shows the conserved rod segment present in all intermediate filament proteins. the molecule also contains an unusual c-terminal extension with stretches of glutamic acid, which could contribute to the anomalous migration of this protein on sds-page and the fact that nf-m does not readily assemble into filaments. the pnf-m2d clone was transcribed and translated in vitro utilizing a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. the resulting radiolabeled translation products were unexpectedly shown to comigrate with purified rat nf-m on 1- and 2- dimensional gels, even though the translated protein is not phosphorylated.
sparc/osteonectin, an endogenous mechanism for targeting albumin to the blood–cerebrospinal fluid interface during brain development osteonectin (sparc, culture shock protein, bm-40) is a widely distributed glycoprotein which binds calcium and several extracellular matrix proteins, including interstitial collagens and thrombospondin, but whose physiologic role remains undefined. in the present studies, we have demonstrated that immunoreactive osteonectin is present in the distal cortical tubule and medullary tubules of murine kidney. we surveyed the renal epithelial cell lines llc-pk1, mdck, and ok for the expression of mrna encoding osteonectin. we found that osteonectin mrna is expressed by llc-pk1 and ok cells but not by mdck cells, as well as by adult kidney from several species. calcitonin and vasopressin, agents which increase camp in these cells, were found to decrease steady-state osteonectin mrna concentrations. we found that llc-pk1 cells produced osteonectin protein, that the protein was localized to intracellular granules, and that the protein bound hydroxyapatite in vitro. pulse-chase analysis revealed that osteonectin was secreted from the cell layer to the medium after a lag time of four to six hours and was secreted preferentially from the basolateral domain of the cell. the preferential secretion of the calcium-binding protein osteonectin from the renal epithelial cell is consistent with several possible functions, including a structural extracellular matrix protein, a participant in transepithelial ion transport, and an inhibitor of extracellular calcification.
mycobacterial ocular inflammation: delay in diagnosis and other factors impacting morbidity. intraocular manifestations of tuberculosis (tb) are rare, but tb infection is common worldwide, especially in developing economies, and in immigrant populations and immunocompromised patients in developed nations. the current review focuses on the clinical characteristics and diagnostic modalities useful in the diagnosis of intraocular tb. specifically, ifn-γ release assays (igras), antigen-detection assays, and polymerase chain reactions will be discussed. clinical management of tb patients includes counseling and testing for hiv infection. the use of corticosteroids along with anti-tuberculous medications and special therapeutic considerations in immunocompromised patients are discussed.
type 2 rhinovirus infection of cultured human tracheal epithelial cells: role of ldl receptor. we have previously reported that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) enhances expression of interleukin-6, collagenase, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and basic fibroblast growth factor genes in human omental microvascular endothelial (home) cells in culture. in this study, we found that treatment of home cells with tnf-alpha or interleukin-1 (il-1) caused enhanced expression of low density lipoprotein (ldl) receptor. a few-fold increase in both ldl binding activity and the receptor mrna levels was observed when home cells were treated with either tnf-alpha or il-1. northern blot analysis showed that cellular expression of ldl receptor gene was significantly increased 12-24 h after exposure to tnf-alpha. no significant changes in the life-span of ldl receptor mrna were observed in untreated and tnf-alpha-treated cells. scatchard analysis showed an increased receptor number for ldl in tnf-alpha-treated cells. parallel to increased ldl binding activity, internalization and degradation of ldl were also increased in home cells treated with tnf-alpha or il-1. tnf-alpha-induced enhancement of ldl receptor gene expression was not observed when cycloheximide was present. cellular mrna level of sp-1 gene was increased about 3-4-fold at 12 h after treatment with tnf-alpha. nuclear run-on assays showed increased transcription of ldl receptor gene as well as sp-1 gene by tnf-alpha. gel retardation assay with the sp-1 consensus fragment showed that sp-1 binding activity was increased about 4-5-fold 12-24 h after treatment with tnf-alpha. nf-kb binding activity was also dramatically increased, but there is no nf-kb motif on the promoter for ldl receptor gene. the induction of ldl receptor by tnf might be mediated through a transcription factor, sp-1.
predictors of postprandial hypotension in elderly patients with de novo parkinson’s disease postprandial hypotension was first recognized as a clinical problem in 1977 in a patient with parkinson disease [1]. however, the hypotensive effect of meal ingestion has been appreciated for a longer time. in 1935, gladstone [2] described a hypertensive patient who had had a postprandial decrease in blood pressure from 185/120 mm hg to 145/80 mm hg. in 1953, smirk [3] observed a decrease in blood pressure after patients with autonomic failure ingested food. robertson and colleagues [4] confirmed these results in patients with chronic autonomic failure and found an average decrease in systolic blood pressure of 49 6 mm hg after a meal [4]. since lipsitz and colleagues [5] first described it in nursing home residents a decade ago, postprandial hypotension has become recognized as a common disorder of blood pressure regulation in the elderly [5]. our current understanding of postprandial hypotension is limited by the lack of a standardized, clinically meaningful definition. analogous to orthostatic hypotension, postprandial hypotension is commonly defined in the literature as a decrease in systolic blood pressure of 20 mm hg or more within 2 hours of the start of a meal. postprandial hypotension also develops when the absolute level of systolic blood pressure after a meal decreases to less than 90 mm hg and when the systolic blood pressure before a meal is greater than 100 mm hg. in addition, if a meal-related decrease in systolic blood pressure exceeds the threshold for cerebral autoregulation, patients may become symptomatic when the absolute systolic blood pressure level exceeds 90 mm hg or when the postprandial systolic blood pressure decreases to less than 20 mm hg. the frequent absence of symptoms associated with this decrease in blood pressure after meal ingestion makes the value of this definition uncertain. in addition, the morbidity and mortality related to postprandial hypotension are unknown. a potential cumulative effect of multiple hypotensive stresses, such as posture change or administration of medication at the time of meal ingestion, makes assessment of the clinical relevance of individual blood pressure responses to a meal even more difficult. although it can be exacerbated by posture change, postprandial hypotension is a distinct entity that differs from orthostatic hypotension. we have reviewed the current knowledge of the epidemiology, clinical symptoms and significance, pathophysiology, and management of postprandial hypotension. we hope to make the practicing physician more aware of this common abnormality in blood pressure regulation and to stimulate new research of its mechanisms and management. methods through a medline search, we identified all articles on postprandial hypertension published between 1966 and 1994. we also used the bibliographies of relevant articles. all articles and case reports describing meal-related hypotension in the elderly and in patients with autonomic failure were included for analysis. epidemiology and associated conditions during the past decade, hypotension in response to ingestion of a mixed meal or oral glucose has been shown in healthy elderly persons [6-14]; young and elderly persons with hypertension [10, 15-21]; elderly patients in nursing homes [5, 22-25]; and patients with postprandial syncope [26, 27], autonomic insufficiency [4, 28-36], parkinson disease [1, 37-39], paraplegia [40], diabetes mellitus [28, 38, 41], cardiovascular disease [42, 43], and renal failure treated with hemodialysis [44, 45]. however, the epidemiology of postprandial hypotension has not been thoroughly studied. mild, meal-induced decreases in blood pressure are common in healthy older persons [6-11], but the prevalence of these decreases is unknown. the presence of multiple illnesses in elderly persons may further impair cardiovascular adaptation to meal ingestion and result in marked postprandial decreases in blood pressure. investigations of elderly persons living in nursing homes have shown that nearly all persons experience some decrease in blood pressure [24, 25]. in 24% to 36% of these patients, systolic blood pressure decreases more than 20 mm hg within 75 minutes of eating a meal [24, 25]. it has been difficult to dissociate the effects of physiologic aging on postprandial blood pressure regulation from those of age-associated illnesses. the elevation in blood pressure associated with aging can profoundly influence postprandial blood pressure. in a study of 82 healthy persons aged 19 to 79 years, meal-related reductions in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly correlated. however, when the data were corrected for baseline blood pressure, this correlation was no longer seen [46]. older hypertensive persons have greater reductions in blood pressure after ingesting food or oral glucose than do age-matched normotensive persons [7, 9, 10, 17-20]. postprandial decreases in systolic blood pressure ranging from 17 to 25 mm hg have been found in hypertensive elderly patients older than age 65 years who did not have other overt cardiovascular diseases [9, 10, 17, 18]. in these patients, diastolic blood pressure may decrease as much as 15 mm hg. however, because hypertensive middle-aged and young persons also have postprandial decreases in blood pressure [10, 16], this phenomenon may be primarily caused by blood pressure elevation rather than by aging itself. profound postprandial hypotension has been observed in patients with autonomic failure [1, 4, 28-36, 47, 48]. the first case report described a 65-year-old man who had dizziness and visual disturbance associated with large decreases in blood pressure after almost every meal [1]. robertson and colleagues [4] found a marked postprandial decrease in sitting systolic blood pressure (range, 22 to 98 mm hg) in 10 patients with autonomic failure. hoeldtke and associates [28, 47] studied patients with multiple-system atrophy (the shy-drager syndrome) and pure autonomic failure and found that the decrease in the mean sitting postprandial arterial blood pressure ranged from 62 to 83 mm hg [28, 47]. all of these patients had blurred vision and dizziness after the meal [47]. postprandial hypotension is also commonly found in patients with peripheral neuropathy caused by diabetes mellitus or other disorders [28, 33, 38, 41] as well as by parkinson disease [1, 37-39]. hypotension is a common side effect of antiparkinsonian drugs such as levodopa. in patients with renal failure, symptomatic postprandial hypotension has been seen during hemodialysis [44, 45]. this appears to be relevant primarily in uremic patients who have autonomic dysfunction. determining the prevalence and clinical implications of postprandial hypotension is complicated not only by different diseases and drugs in the populations studied but also by methodologic inconsistencies among studies. first, the body's position while the meal is being consumed probably affects food-induced changes in blood pressure. postprandial hypotension occurs both in the sitting and supine positions. although the sitting position is more physiologic, orthostatic changes in blood pressure during prolonged sitting might contribute to the postprandial decrease in blood pressure. second, no studies have addressed the variability of postprandial blood pressure. previous studies have shown that orthostatic blood pressure measurements in the elderly vary considerably from day to day [49]. this could also be true for postprandial hypotension. third, the nutrient composition of meals affects the magnitude of the decrease in postprandial blood pressure [12, 13, 15, 50]. carbohydrates and, more specifically, glucose have been found to play a significant role [10, 29]. however, conflicting data have been reported about the influence of fat or protein on postprandial blood pressure [12, 13, 15, 51, 52]. fourth, postprandial hypotension depends on the temperature of the meal [53]. after cold glucose solutions are ingested, blood pressure remains unchanged, whereas glucose solutions served warm or at room temperature cause a decrease in blood pressure. finally, the time at which blood pressure is measured after a meal may influence the detection of this phenomenon. postprandial hypotension can be found at all meal times [14] and is almost immediately apparent after a meal. blood pressure usually reaches a nadir within 30 to 60 minutes. in nursing home residents, the systolic blood pressure nadir occurred as early as 15 minutes after the meal in 13% to 17% of the patients and as late as 75 minutes after the meal in 11% to 13% of the patients [24, 25]. clinical symptoms and significance in elderly persons or patients with autonomic failure, postprandial reductions in blood pressure may result in syncope, falls, angina pectoris, weakness, dizziness, nausea, lightheadedness, or black spots in the visual field [1, 5, 22, 24-26, 29, 39, 46] (table 1). in addition, case reports have described elderly patients with large postprandial reductions in blood pressure who developed angina pectoris or transient ischemic attacks that resolved as blood pressure returned to normal [24, 54]. however, data on the frequency of postprandial hypotension and its potential symptoms are scarce. in one recent study, half of a group of patients with unexplained syncope had postprandial hypotension [27]. table 1. clinical symptoms associated with postprandial hypotension the cerebral symptoms probably depend on the extent to which cerebral perfusion is compromised. accumulation of age- and disease-related conditions that threaten cerebral blood flow or reduce oxygen content in the blood may bring cerebral oxygen delivery near the threshold needed to maintain consciousness [55]. therefore, even small changes in blood pressure may reduce cerebral oxygen delivery to below the critical threshold and thus result in ischemic symptoms. the potential for postprandial cerebral ischemia may be greater in elderly p
ultrasonographic and magnetic resonance imaging diagnosis of an oropharyngeal wood penetrating injury in a dog. objective the purpose of this study was to identify the characteristic imaging features of wooden foreign bodies.   materials and methods the imaging studies of 12 patients with surgically confirmed wooden foreign bodies were retrospectively reviewed. the study group consisted of seven females and five males, 10-65 years old (mean age, 36 years). all patients underwent radiography. nine patients were evaluated with sonography, eight with mr imaging, three with ct, and one with ct arthrography. gadolinium-enhanced mr imaging was performed in six patients. three patients presented with a draining sinus and nine with painful swelling. only three patients presented with a history of penetrating injury.   results lesions were located in the foot (n = 4), hand (n = 3), thigh (n = 2), calf (n = 2), and elbow (n = 1). radiographs failed to reveal the retained foreign bodies in all patients. with mr imaging, wooden foreign bodies displayed a variable signal intensity that was equal to or less than that of skeletal muscle on both t1- and t2-weighted images. mr imaging showed the surrounding inflammatory response in all patients. ct showed the retained wood as linear cylindric foci of increased attenuation. wood was highly echogenic and revealed pronounced acoustic shadowing on sonography. arthrography in one patient showed an associated reactive synovitis.   conclusion the imaging appearance of wooden foreign bodies is variable; however, imaging can be quite specific, and when taken in the appropriate clinical setting, the imaging should reliably suggest the diagnosis. sonography is frequently underused but proved most useful for the evaluation of retained wooden foreign bodies.
enigmatic orthology relationships between hox clusters of the african butterfly fish and other teleosts following ancient whole-genome duplication changes in ploidy occurred early in the diversification of some animal and plant lineages and represent an ongoing phenomenon in others. while the prevalence of polyploid lineages indicates that this phenomenon is a common and successful evolutionary transition, whether polyploidization itself has a significant effect on patterns and rates of diversification remains an open question. here we review evidence for the creative role of polyploidy in evolution. we present new estimates for the incidence of polyploidy in ferns and flowering plants based on a simple model describing transitions between odd and even base chromosome numbers. these new estimates indicate that ploidy changes may represent from 2 to 4% of speciation events in flowering plants and 7% in ferns. speciation via polyploidy is likely to be one of the more predominant modes of sympatric speciation in plants, owing to its potentially broad-scale effects on gene regulation and developmental processes, effects that can produce immediate shifts in morphology, breeding system, and ecological tolerances. theoretical models support the potential for increased adaptability in polyploid lineages. the evidence suggests that polyploidization can produce shifts in genetic systems and phenotypes that have the potential to result in increased evolutionary diversification, yet conclusive evidence that polyploidy has changed rates and patterns of diversification remains elusive.
towards a universal data provenance framework using dynamic instrumentation a provenance-aware storage system (pass) is a storage system that automatically collects and maintains provenance or lineage, the complete history or ancestry of an item. we discuss the advantages of treating provenance as meta-data collected and maintained by the storage system, rather than as manual annotations stored in a separately administered database. we describe a pass implementation, discussing the challenges it presents, performance cost it incurs, and the new functionality it enables. we show that with reasonable overhead, we can provide useful functionality not available in today's file systems or provenance management systems.
linking microbial community composition to function in a tropical soil abstract biolog gn plates are increasingly used to characterize microbial communities by determining the ability of the communities to oxidize various carbon sources. studies were done to determine whether the biolog gn plate assay accurately reflects the catabolic potential of the inoculum used. to gain insight into which populations of microbial communities contribute to the biolog patterns, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (tgge) were used to assess the diversity of ribotypes in the inocula and individual wells of biolog plates following incubation. these studies were done with microbial communities from the rhizosphere of potatoes and an activated sludge reactor fed with glucose and peptone. tgge analyses of biolog wells inoculated with cell suspensions from the potato rhizosphere revealed that, compared with the inoculum, there was a decrease in the number of 16s rrna gene fragments obtained from various wells, as well as a concomitant loss of populations that had been numerically dominant in the inoculum. the dominant fragments in tgge gels could be assigned to the γ subclass of the classproteobacteria, suggesting that fast-growing bacteria adapted to high substrate concentrations were numerically dominant in the wells and may have been primarily responsible for the patterns of substrate use that were observed. similarly, the community structure changed in wells inoculated with cells from activated sludge; one or more populations were enriched, but all dominant populations of the inoculum could be detected in at least one well. this study showed that carbon source utilization profiles obtained with biolog gn plates do not necessarily reflect the functional potential of the numerically dominant members of the microbial community used as the inoculum.
association of the breast cancer antiestrogen resistance protein 1 (bcar1) and bcar3 scaffolding proteins in cell signaling and antiestrogen resistance* the adapter molecule p130cas (cas) plays a role in cellular processes such as proliferation, survival, cell adhesion, and migration. the ability of cas to promote migration has been shown to be dependent upon its carboxyl terminus, which contains a bipartite binding site for the protein tyrosine kinase c-src (src). the association between src and cas enhances src kinase activity, and like cas, src plays an important role in cell proliferation and migration. in this study, we show that src and cas function cooperatively to promote cell migration in a manner that depends upon kinase-active src. another carboxyl-terminal binding partner of cas, and-34/bcar3 (and-34), functions synergistically with cas to enhance src activation and cell migration. the carboxyl-terminal guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain of and-34, as well as the activity of its putative target rap1, contribute to these events. a mechanism through which and-34 may regulate cas-dependent cell migration is suggested by the finding that cas becomes redistributed from focal adhesions to lamellipodia located at the leading edge of and-34 overexpressing cells. these data thus provide insight into how cas and and-34 may function together to stimulate src signaling pathways and promote cell migration.
communication about congenital adrenal hyperplasia: perspective of filipino families summarythe success of blood spot newborn screening in the usa led to early screening efforts in parts of the asia pacific region in the mid-1960s. while there were early screening leaders in the region, many of the countries with depressed and developing economies are only now beginning organized screening efforts. four periods of screening growth in the asia pacific region were identified. beginning in the 1960s, blood spot screening began in new zealand and australia, followed by japan and a cord blood screening programme for g6pd deficiency in singapore. in the 1980s, established programmes added congenital hypothyroidism and new programmes developed in taiwan, hong kong, china (shanghai), india and malaysia. programmes developing in the 1990s built on the experience of others developing more rapidly in korea, thailand and the philippines. in the 2000s, with limited funding support from the international atomic energy agency, there has been screening programme development around detection of congenital hypothyroidism in indonesia, mongolia, sri lanka, myanmar and pakistan. palau has recently contracted with the philippine newborn screening programme. there is little information available on newborn screening activities in nepal, cambodia, laos and the other pacific island nations, with no organized screening efforts apparent. since approximately half of the births in the world occur in the asia pacific region, it is important to continue the ongoing implementation and expansion efforts so that these children can attain the same health status as children in more developed parts of the world and their full potential can be realized.
metrics calculation for deployment process as the development and use of component-based software becomes increasingly pervasive, the need arises for tools that support the controlled evolution of independently developed components—both at development and at deployment time. traditionally, such tools have been separate: configuration management tools are used during the development of a software product and deployment tools are used to install, update, and reconfigure a software product once it is out in the field. this position paper first presents an argument why this separation is inadequate for component-based software. then, it presents a set of requirements for an integrated system that intimately combines configuration management and software deployment functionality to support the evolution of component-based software in a unified manner.
arabidopsis ttg2 regulates try expression through enhancement of activator complex-triggered activation[c][w] trichome patterning in arabidopsis rosette leaves serves as a model system to study how individual cells are determined in a regular spacing pattern from initially equivalent cells. a conserved gene cassette regulates this spacing pattern. bhlh, myb, and wd40 factors are positive regulators of trichome development that are inhibited by r3 single-repeat myb proteins. one positive regulator, the wd40-protein, and the negative regulators are mobile and are transported in opposite directions: the wd40 factor moves to the negative regulators away from trichome initials. this movement behavior and the genetic and molecular interactions between the contributing genes and proteins make it very difficult to derive the mechanistic core behind pattern formation. attempts to develop mathematical models toward this end are critically discussed.
phylogeographical patterns shed light on evolutionary process in south america the making of amazonian diversity the biodiversity of the amazon basin is legendary, but the processes by which it has been generated have been debated. in the late 20th century the prevalent view was that the engine of diversity was repeated contraction and expansion of forest refugia during the past 3 million years or so. hoorn et al. (p. 927) analyze findings from a diverse range of disciplines, including molecular phylogeny, ecology, sedimentology, structural geology, and palaeontology, to offer an overview of the entire history of this region during the cenozoic era (66 million years ago). the uplift of the andes was a pivotal event in the evolution of amazonian landscapes because it continually altered river drainage patterns, which in turn put a variety of pressures on organisms to adapt to changing conditions in a multiplicity of ways. hence, the diversity of the modern biota of the amazon has more ancient origins than previously thought. the amazonian rainforest is arguably the most species-rich terrestrial ecosystem in the world, yet the timing of the origin and evolutionary causes of this diversity are a matter of debate. we review the geologic and phylogenetic evidence from amazonia and compare it with uplift records from the andes. this uplift and its effect on regional climate fundamentally changed the amazonian landscape by reconfiguring drainage patterns and creating a vast influx of sediments into the basin. on this “andean” substrate, a region-wide edaphic mosaic developed that became extremely rich in species, particularly in western amazonia. we show that andean uplift was crucial for the evolution of amazonian landscapes and ecosystems, and that current biodiversity patterns are rooted deep in the pre-quaternary.
examination of college student achievement within an ecological framework previous authors (e.g., b. r. sarason, shearin, pierce, & sarason, 1987) have found that perceived social support can affect the emotional well-being of an individual. consequently, the effective assessment of social supports is a key issue in both research and clinical practice. the multidimensional scale of perceived social support (mspss; zimet, dahlem, zimet, & farley, 1988) divides perceived social support into 3 distinct constructs-that derived from family members, from friends, and from significant others. this study is the first to assess the mspss using confirmatory factor analysis in both a college student (n = 549) and psychiatric outpatient (n = 156) sample. based on several goodness-of-fit indicators, a 3-factor model for the mspss was supported in both samples, as was a single, higher order domain of global social support. the perceived social support factors of family and friends consistently had the strongest associations with symptomatology. these results support the use of the mspss as a brief instrument for assessing the hierarchical structure of perceived social support in a variety of samples.
biomarkers for melanoma diagnosis and the technologies used to identify them during the past several decades, there has been a substantial increase in the incidence of cutaneous melanoma among all caucasian populations. the number of deaths due to cutaneous malignant melanoma has also increased in most fair‐skinned populations throughout the world in the past few decades. trends in melanoma incidence worldwide are examined. the most recent data on the mortality from cutaneous melanoma are reported. the role of different environmental, genetic and host factors in the aetiology of melanoma is discussed.
advances in functional magnetic resonance imaging of the human brainstem the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (csf) through the aqueduct was studied with an echoplanar imaging technique. images (1024) of a slice perpendicular to the aqueduct were acquired with a repetition time of 107 msec and a flip angle of 90°. this imaging technique is very sensitive for flow into the selected slice, although a quantitative assessment of flow velocities is not possible. simultaneously with the image data acquisition, data from a pulse oximeter and a respiration belt were recorded. for each data point, a delay time to the preceding cardiac pulse was determined from the recorded pulse wave. the signal intensities could then be assigned to the cardiac cycle. each cardiac interval was assigned to one of eight respiratory phases, and an average signal curve during the cardiac interval was calculated for each respiration phase. the evaluation showed to signal maxima within the cardiac interval, which could be identified as a downward flow at 10% and an upward flow at 80% of the cardiac pulse interval by measurements with additional saturation pulses. in examinations of 22 healthy volunteers, an influence of respiration on the flow through the aqueduct was found. in spite of interindividual variability, comparable effects could be observed in all volunteers. in the late expiration phase the caudally directed flow was at its maximum, whereas the cranially directed flow was maximal in the post‐inspiration phase. j. magn. reson. imaging 2000;11:438–444. © 2000 wiley‐liss, inc.
determination of oxycodone and its major metabolites noroxycodone and oxymorphone by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in plasma and urine: application to real cases oxycodone is an opioid agonist largely prescribed for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. variability in analgesic efficacy could be explained by inter-subject variations in plasma levels of parent drug and its active metabolite, oxymorphone. for this purpose it is necessary to develop and validate a sensitive and selective analytical method for the quantification of oxycodone and its major metabolites, noroxycodone and oxymorphone, in human plasma. the analytical method consisted of a liquid-liquid extraction procedure followed by a high performance liquid chromatography with heated assisted electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (hplc-hesi-ms/ms). the chromatographic separation was achieved using gradient elution with a mobile phase consisting of ethanol and 10mm ammonium acetate on a synergi max-rp analytical column (150×2mm, 4μm) protected by a security guard cartridge (c12 4×2mm) at a flow rate of 300μl/min.the calibration functions are linear in the range of 300-50,000pg/ml for oxycodone and noroxycodone and 50 to 10 000pg/ml for oxymorphone. intra- and inter-day relative standard deviations are less than 5.5% and 6.4%, respectively for all analytes. the limit of detection was 30pg/ml for all analytes. we introduce a new hplc-hesi-ms/ms sensitive and specific analytical method capable to simultaneously quantify oxycodone, noroxycodone and oxymorphone, in human plasma, and suitable for the conduct of pharmacokinetic studies after a single dose administration of the parent compound.
skeletal muscle myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic protein synthesis rates are affected differently by altitude-induced hypoxia in native lowlanders to test the hypothesis that the increased sympathetic tonus elicited by chronic hypoxia is needed to match o2 delivery with o2 demand at the microvascular level eight male subjects were investigated at 4559 m altitude during maximal exercise with and without infusion of atp (80 μg (kg body mass)−1 min−1) into the right femoral artery. compared to sea level peak leg vascular conductance was reduced by 39% at altitude. however, the infusion of atp at altitude did not alter femoral vein blood flow (7.6 ± 1.0 versus 7.9 ± 1.0 l min−1) and femoral arterial oxygen delivery (1.2 ± 0.2 versus 1.3 ± 0.2 l min−1; control and atp, respectively). despite the fact that with atp mean arterial blood pressure decreased (106.9 ± 14.2 versus 83.3 ± 16.0 mmhg, p < 0.05), peak cardiac output remained unchanged. arterial oxygen extraction fraction was reduced from 85.9 ± 5.3 to 72.0 ± 10.2% (p < 0.05), and the corresponding venous o2 content was increased from 25.5 ± 10.0 to 46.3 ± 18.5 ml l−1 (control and atp, respectively, p < 0.05). with atp, leg arterial–venous o2 difference was decreased (p < 0.05) from 139.3 ± 9.0 to 116.9 ± 8.4−1 and leg was 20% lower compared to the control trial (1.1 ± 0.2 versus 0.9 ± 0.1 l min−1) (p= 0.069). in summary, at altitude, some degree of vasoconstriction is needed to match o2 delivery with o2 demand. peak cardiac output at altitude is not limited by excessive mean arterial pressure. exercising leg is not limited by restricted vasodilatation in the altitude‐acclimatized human.
women-specific hiv/aids services: identifying and defining the components of holistic service delivery for women living with hiv/aids specialized substance abuse treatment programs have been developed for women within the past two decades. this article presents the results of a secondary analysis of a regional database of drug abuse treatment programs that compared the characteristics of women-only (wo) and mixed-gender (mg) programs across three treatment modalities. in general, wo programs differed from mg programs in their policies regarding fees, sources of payment, special populations served, services offered, and treatment capacity, process, and duration. the differences in program characteristics reflect broader societal gender differences, including women's generally lower economic status and primary responsibility for child-rearing.
does neighborhood belonging matter? examining school and neighborhood belonging as protective factors for latino adolescents. normed and nonnormed fit indexes are frequently used as adjuncts to chi-square statistics for evaluating the fit of a structural model. a drawback of existing indexes is that they estimate no known population parameters. a new coefficient is proposed to summarize the relative reduction in the noncentrality parameters of two nested models. two estimators of the coefficient yield new normed (cfi) and nonnormed (fi) fit indexes. cfi avoids the underestimation of fit often noted in small samples for bentler and bonett's (1980) normed fit index (nfi). fi is a linear function of bentler and bonett's non-normed fit index (nnfi) that avoids the extreme underestimation and overestimation often found in nnfi. asymptotically, cfi, fi, nfi, and a new index developed by bollen are equivalent measures of comparative fit, whereas nnfi measures relative fit by comparing noncentrality per degree of freedom. all of the indexes are generalized to permit use of wald and lagrange multiplier statistics. an example illustrates the behavior of these indexes under conditions of correct specification and misspecification. the new fit indexes perform very well at all sample sizes.
efficacy and safety of enoxaparin in japanese patients undergoing curative abdominal or pelvic cancer surgery: results from a multicenter, randomized, open-label study. consecutive patients undergoing knee arthroplasty or tibial osteotomy at four participating hospitals received either enoxaparin, 30 mg subcutaneously every 12 h (n = 66) or an identical-appearing placebo (n = 65). all study medications started the morning after the operation and were continued up to a maximum of 14 days. patients underwent surveillance with 125i-fibrinogen leg scanning and impedance plethysmography. bilateral contrast venography was performed routinely at day 14 or at time of discharge, if sooner. deep vein thrombosis was detected by venography in 35 of 54 patients (65%) in the placebo group and in 8 of 41 patients in the enoxaparin group (19%), a risk reduction of 71%, p less than 0.0001. for the entire study group, deep vein thrombosis was detected by either venography of non-invasive tests in 37 of 64 patients (58%) in the placebo group and in 11 of 65 patients (17%) in the enoxaparin group, a risk reduction of 71%, p less than 0.0001. proximal vein thrombosis was found in 19% of the placebo patients and in none of the enoxaparin patients, a risk reduction of 100%, p less than 0.001. bleeding complications occurred in 5 of 65 patients (8%) in the placebo group and in 4 of 66 patients (6%) in the enoxaparin group, p = 0.71. there were no differences in the amount of blood loss, minimum hemoglobin levels and number of units of packed red cells given between the two treatment groups. we conclude that a fixed dose regimen of enoxaparin, started post-operatively, is an effective and safe regimen for reducing the frequency of deep vein thrombosis after major knee surgery.
optimized linear, quadratic and cubic interpolators for elementary function hardware implementations describes a table compression method employing finite-precision linear interpolation in reciprocal tables. the interpolation method employs a compressed look-up table and a small-sized multiplier to yield an output reciprocal as a simple direct operation. the leading bits of the arbitrarily precise input are used to index the table, and a limited number of succeeding fractional bits are used to interpolate on the table employing a multiply/add operation. the low-order bits of the product are rounded off so that the output reciprocals are guaranteed to be correct to a unit in the last place and provide a round-to-nearest reciprocal for over 90% of arbitrarily precise input arguments. the interpolation method generates 2k-bit faithful reciprocals employing a k-bits-in, (2k+2)-bits-out table and a (k+3)/spl times/(k+3)-bit multiplier. a single-precision faithful reciprocal can be generated employing a table of size 13 kbytes and a 15/spl times/15-bit multiplier, compared to a table size of 46 mbytes for conventional reciprocal tables. the table and dedicated small multiplier efficiently characterize a functional reciprocator unit with, at most, a 2-cycle latency.
clostridium difficile heterogeneously impacts intestinal community architecture but drives stable metabolome responses defining the functional status of host-associated microbial ecosystems has proven challenging owing to the vast number of predicted genes within the microbiome and relatively poor understanding of community dynamics and community–host interaction. metabolomic approaches, in which a large number of small molecule metabolites can be defined in a biological sample, offer a promising avenue to ‘fingerprint’ microbiota functional status. here, we examined the effects of the human gut microbiota on the fecal and urinary metabolome of a humanized (hum) mouse using an optimized ultra performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry-based method. differences between hum and conventional mouse urine and fecal metabolomic profiles support host-specific aspects of the microbiota’s metabolomic contribution, consistent with distinct microbial compositions. comparison of microbiota composition and metabolome of mice humanized with different human donors revealed that the vast majority of metabolomic features observed in donor samples are produced in the corresponding hum mice, and individual-specific features suggest ‘personalized’ aspects of functionality can be reconstituted in mice. feeding the mice a defined, custom diet resulted in modification of the metabolite signatures, illustrating that host diet provides an avenue for altering gut microbiota functionality, which in turn can be monitored via metabolomics. using a defined model microbiota consisting of one or two species, we show that simplified communities can drive major changes in the host metabolomic profile. our results demonstrate that metabolomics constitutes a powerful avenue for functional characterization of the intestinal microbiota and its interaction with the host.
characterization of transcription factor networks involved in umbilical cord blood cd34+ stem cells-derived erythropoiesis gene-distal enhancers are critical for tissue-specific gene expression, but their genomic determinants within a specific lineage at different stages of development are unknown. here we profile chromatin state maps, transcription factor occupancy, and gene expression profiles during human erythroid development at fetal and adult stages. comparative analyses of human erythropoiesis identify developmental stage-specific enhancers as primary determinants of stage-specific gene expression programs. we find that erythroid master regulators gata1 and tal1 act cooperatively within active enhancers but confer little predictive value for stage specificity. instead, a set of stage-specific coregulators collaborates with master regulators and contributes to differential gene expression. we further identify and validate irf2, irf6, and myb as effectors of an adult-stage expression program. thus, the combinatorial assembly of lineage-specific master regulators and transcriptional coregulators within developmental stage-specific enhancers determines gene expression programs and temporal regulation of transcriptional networks in a mammalian genome.
oncogenes and tumor suppressors the cytidine deaminase apobec 3 family is subject to transcriptional regulation by p 53 the fundamental biological importance of the tp53 gene family is highlighted by its evolutionary conservation for more than one billion years dating back to the earliest multicellular organisms. the tp53 protein provides essential functions in the cellular response to diverse stresses and safeguards maintenance of genomic integrity, and this is manifest in its critical role in tumor suppression. the importance of tp53 in tumor prevention is exemplified in human cancer where it is the most frequently detected genetic alteration. this is confirmed in animal models, in which a defective tp53 gene leads inexorably to cancer development, whereas reinstatement of tp53 function results in regression of established tumors that had been initiated by loss of tp53. remarkably, despite extensive investigation, the specific mechanisms by which tp53 acts as a tumor suppressor are yet to be fully defined. we review the history and current standing of efforts to understand these mechanisms and how they complement each other in tumor suppression.
reciprocal regulation of microrna-99a and insulin-like growth factor i receptor signaling in oral squamous cell carcinoma cells background: microrna-99a markedly decreases in hcc. results: microrna-99a expression correlates with hcc patients' survival, and microrna-99a restoration suppresses hcc growth in vitro and in vivo by targeting igf-1r and mtor. conclusions: microrna-99a could be prognosis predictor and tumor suppressor for hcc. significance: reveal the important role of microrna-99a in hcc development and provide prognosis predictor and therapeutic approach for hcc. in our in-depth analysis carried out by the illumina solexa massive parallel signature sequencing, microrna-99a (mir-99a) was found to be the sixth abundant microrna in the mirnome of normal human liver but was markedly down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). compelling evidence has suggested the important roles of micrornas in hcc development. however, the biological function of mir-99a deregulation in hcc remains unknown. in this study, we found that mir-99a was remarkably decreased in hcc tissues and cell lines. importantly, lower mir-99a expression in hcc tissues significantly correlated with shorter survival of hcc patients, and mir-99a was identified to be an independent predictor for the prognosis of hcc patients. furthermore, restoration of mir-99a dramatically suppressed hcc cell growth in vitro by inducing the g1 phase cell cycle arrest. intratumoral injection of cholesterol-conjugated mir-99a mimics significantly inhibited tumor growth and reduced the α-fetoprotein level in hcc-bearing nude mice. insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (igf-1r) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) were further characterized as the direct targets of mir-99a. furthermore, protein levels of igf-1r and mtor were found to be inversely correlated with mir-99a expression in hcc tissues. mir-99a mimics inhibited igf-1r and mtor pathways and subsequently suppressed expression of cell cycle-related proteins, including cyclin d1 in hcc cells. conclusively, mir-99a expression was frequently down-regulated in hcc tissues and correlates with the prognosis of hcc patients, thus proposing mir-99a as a prospective prognosis predictor of hcc. mir-99a suppresses hcc growth by inducing cell cycle arrest, suggesting mir-99a as potential tumor suppressor for hcc therapeutics.
colorectal screening is associated with reduced colorectal cancer risk: a case–control study within the population-based ontario familial colorectal cancer registry in the united states, colorectal carcinoma (crc) is the fourth most frequently diagnosed and the second most common cause of cancer-specific death for both men and women (1). the lifetime risk of developing crc is approximately 6% (2), and treatment costs nearly $6 billion annually (3). as for most epithelial cancers, crc age-specific incidence increases continuously with biologic aging, with the greatest risk occurring in those individuals aged 80 years or older (2) (fig. 1). of the more than 148 000 estimated new crc cases in the year 2002 (4), approximately 40% are expected to die within 5 years (2). death from crc is especially unfortunate, given that crc prevention often can be achieved through screening (5). crc screening affords the opportunity to identify and remove precursor lesions (e.g., preinvasive adenomatous polyps or adenomas) (6). indeed, direct, longitudinal observation of, and intervention in, the long-term, multi-step process of colorectal carcinogenesis—partially represented by the adenomato-carcinoma sequence in fig. 2 (7,8)—can be achieved with existing endoscopic technologies (6,9,10). although efficacy has been demonstrated in this regard, only 44% of u.s. adults aged 50 years or older have recently had any type of crc screening (11). to address these and other concerns, the national cancer institute (nci) convened a workshop in march 2001 to review 1) routine and emerging crc screening technologies; 2) valid endpoints (or targets) for crc screening, particularly with regard to comparative evaluations of new and existing technologies; and 3) barriers to screening. this document with commentary from the authors summarizes the nci workshop proceedings. appendices a and b provide a complete listing of speakers and attendees.
abt-414, an antibody–drug conjugate targeting a tumor-selective egfr epitope objective: to compile evidence from randomized controlled trials, case series, and case reports to identify the effectiveness of various therapeutic agents for the treatment and prevention of dermatologie effects secondary to epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor (egfri) administration. data sources: literature was accessed through pubmed (2002–may 2009) and scopus (2002–march 2009), using the terms epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor, cetuximab, erlotinib, gefilinib, panitumumab, management, skin toxicity, and cutaneous effects. in addition, reference citations from publications identified were reviewed. study selection and data extraction: an evaluation of published clinical trials, case series, case reports, and clinical management guidelines that studied the treatment options for egfri-induced skin toxicities was performed. studies that reported dosing regimens and treatment outcomes were included in this review. data synthesis: management of egfri-induced skin toxicities has been documented in 2 randomized controlled trials, 3 case series, and 10 case reports in a total of 156 patients. there is strong evidence for the use of topical antibiotics to manage egfri skin toxicities. controversy exists regarding the use of corticosteroids and retinoids for the management of egfri-induced rash. several variables are noted among the number of case series and case reports, such as follow-up duration of the intervention, making any comparisons difficult. conclusions: overall, antibiotics are the most common treatment option and have the potential to reduce the severity of skin rash. well-designed clinical studies with proper recording of relevant data on the management of egfri-induced dermatologie effects are needed to properly evaluate the use of various therapeutic agents. apart from randomized controlled trials, comprehensive case reports are also important for clinical evaluation on a case-by-case basis.
transdisciplinary teamwork: the experience of clinicians at a functional restoration program primary health care is undergoing significant organizational change, including the development of interdisciplinary health care teams. understanding how teams function effectively in primary care will assist training programs in teaching effective interprofessional practices. this study aimed to explore the views of members of primary health care teams regarding what constitutes a team, team effectiveness and the factors that affect team effectiveness in primary care. focus group consultations from six teams in the department of family medicine at queen's university were recorded and transcribed and qualitative analysis was used to identify themes. twelve themes were identified that related to the impact of dual goals/obligations of education and clinical/patient practice on team relationships and learners; the challenges of determining team membership including nonattendance of allied health professionals except nurses; and facilitators and barriers to effective team function. this study provides insight into some of the challenges of developing effective primary care teams in an academic department of family medicine. clear goals and attention to teamwork at all levels of collaboration is needed if effective interprofessional education is to be achieved. future research should clarify how best to support the changes required for increasingly effective teamwork.
guanine quadruplex structures localize to heterochromatin telomeres are specialized nucleoprotein complexes that provide protection to the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. telomeric dna consists of tandemly repeated g-rich sequences that terminate with a 3′ single-stranded overhang, which is important for telomere extension by the telomerase enzyme. this structure, as well as most of the proteins that specifically bind double and single-stranded telomeric dna, are conserved from yeast to humans, suggesting that the mechanisms underlying telomere identity are based on common principles. the telomeric 3′ overhang is generated by different events depending on whether the newly synthesized strand is the product of leading- or lagging-strand synthesis. here, we review the mechanisms that regulate these processes at saccharomyces cerevisiae and mammalian telomeres.
plant-produced asialo-erythropoietin restores pancreatic beta-cell function by suppressing mammalian sterile-20-like kinase (mst1) and caspase-3 activation manipulation of the hippo signaling pathway with a reversible and selective small-molecule inhibitor of hippo kinase mst1/2 provides a therapeutic option for tissue injury and repair. drug-induced regeneration popping a pill to repair an organ may eventually become reality. turning away from conventional scaffolds, materials, and cell-based regenerative medicine strategies, fan and colleagues sought a small molecule that could specifically target a critical signaling molecule in the hippo pathway. loss of kinases in this pathway, mst1/2, increases cell proliferation during development; thus, the authors hypothesized that inhibiting their activity in mature organs could help repair any damage. they discovered a drug, xmu-mp-1, that blocked mst1/2 activity and found that it promoted liver repair and regeneration in four different mouse models of acute and chronic injuries, including acetaminophen-induced injury, which is a common cause of liver failure worldwide. such a pharmacological strategy could make tissue regeneration easier for many, compared to complex biomaterial and cell therapies. tissue repair and regenerative medicine address the important medical needs to replace damaged tissue with functional tissue. most regenerative medicine strategies have focused on delivering biomaterials and cells, yet there is the untapped potential for drug-induced regeneration with good specificity and safety profiles. the hippo pathway is a key regulator of organ size and regeneration by inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis. kinases mst1 and mst2 (mst1/2), the mammalian hippo orthologs, are central components of this pathway and are, therefore, strong target candidates for pharmacologically induced tissue regeneration. we report the discovery of a reversible and selective mst1/2 inhibitor, 4-((5,10-dimethyl-6-oxo-6,10-dihydro-5h-pyrimido[5,4-b]thieno[3,2-e][1,4]diazepin-2-yl)amino)benzenesulfonamide (xmu-mp-1), using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay–based high-throughput biochemical assay. the cocrystal structure and the structure-activity relationship confirmed that xmu-mp-1 is on-target to mst1/2. xmu-mp-1 blocked mst1/2 kinase activities, thereby activating the downstream effector yes-associated protein and promoting cell growth. xmu-mp-1 displayed excellent in vivo pharmacokinetics and was able to augment mouse intestinal repair, as well as liver repair and regeneration, in both acute and chronic liver injury mouse models at a dose of 1 to 3 mg/kg via intraperitoneal injection. xmu-mp-1 treatment exhibited substantially greater repopulation rate of human hepatocytes in the fah-deficient mouse model than in the vehicle-treated control, indicating that xmu-mp-1 treatment might facilitate human liver regeneration. thus, the pharmacological modulation of mst1/2 kinase activities provides a novel approach to potentiate tissue repair and regeneration, with xmu-mp-1 as the first lead for the development of targeted regenerative therapeutics.
optimal study design for pioglitazone in septic pediatric patients growth and development can be investigated using readily observable demographic factors such as weight and age. size is the primary covariate and can be referenced to a 70-kg person with allometry using a coefficient of 0.75 for clearance and 1 for volume. the use of these coefficients is supported by fractal geometric concepts and observations from diverse areas in biology. fat free mass (ffm) might be expected to do better than total body weight when there are wide variations in fat affecting body composition. clearance pathways develop in the fetus before birth. the use of postnatal age as a descriptor of maturation is unsatisfactory because birth may occur prematurely; therefore postmenstrual age is a superior predictor of elimination function. a sigmoid e(max) model (hill equation) describes gradual maturation of clearance in early life leading to a mature adult clearance achieved at a later age.
mendelian randomization: new applications in the coming age of hypothesis-free causality. objectives the purpose of this study was to estimate the effect of long-term exposure to lower plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c) on the risk of coronary heart disease (chd).   background ldl-c is causally related to the risk of chd. however, the association between long-term exposure to lower ldl-c beginning early in life and the risk of chd has not been reliably quantified.   methods we conducted a series of meta-analyses to estimate the effect of long-term exposure to lower ldl-c on the risk of chd mediated by 9 polymorphisms in 6 different genes. we then combined these mendelian randomization studies in a meta-analysis to obtain a more precise estimate of the effect of long-term exposure to lower ldl-c and compared it with the clinical benefit associated with the same magnitude of ldl-c reduction during treatment with a statin.   results all 9 polymorphisms were associated with a highly consistent reduction in the risk of chd per unit lower ldl-c, with no evidence of heterogeneity of effect (i(2) = 0.0%). in a meta-analysis combining nonoverlapping data from 312,321 participants, naturally random allocation to long-term exposure to lower ldl-c was associated with a 54.5% (95% confidence interval: 48.8% to 59.5%) reduction in the risk of chd for each mmol/l (38.7 mg/dl) lower ldl-c. this represents a 3-fold greater reduction in the risk of chd per unit lower ldl-c than that observed during treatment with a statin started later in life (p = 8.43 × 10(-19)).   conclusions prolonged exposure to lower ldl-c beginning early in life is associated with a substantially greater reduction in the risk of chd than the current practice of lowering ldl-c beginning later in life.
a metapopulation modelling framework for gonorrhoea and other sexually transmitted infections in heterosexual populations spatial distribution of repeat and singly occurring gonorrhea in baltimore, maryland, was examined to identify clusters of core transmitters. gonorrhea reported between 2001 and 2002 was geocoded and mapped. those with more than one gonorrhea infection separated by more than 14 days during the 2-year period were considered repeaters. other cases were treated as isolated events. six definitions of core transmission were examined by census tracts with the highest quintiles of 1) cases for 2001, 2) cases for 2002, 3) rates for 2001, 4) rates for 2002, 5) counts of repeaters over the 2-year period, and 6) proportion of total cases that were repeaters. of the 6,108 gonorrhea cases analyzed, 9% were repeaters. repeaters were more likely to be female and younger. core areas identified by definitions based on overall disease burden agreed well with each other but had poor agreement with definitions based upon repeat infections. repeaters clustered to a greater extent at smaller distances than did singly occurring gonorrhea cases. repeat gonorrhea infections are prevalent in baltimore and likely represent behavior consistent with core transmission. census tracts of core transmission defined by geographic distribution of repeat infections may indicate foci of highest risk sexual behaviors and high transmission.
phishing detection based associative classification data mining building fast and accurate classifiers for large-scale databases is an important task in data mining. there is growing evidence that integrating classification and association rule mining together can produce more efficient and accurate classifiers than traditional classification techniques. in this paper, the problem of producing rules with multiple labels is investigated. we propose a new associative classification approach called multi-class, multi-label associative classification (mmac). this paper also presents three measures for evaluating the accuracy of data mining classification approaches to a wide range of traditional and multi-label classification problems. results for 28 different datasets show that the mmac approach is an accurate and effective classification technique, highly competitive and scalable in comparison with other classification approaches.
pet imaging of cholinergic deficits in rats using [18f]fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol ([18f]feobv) background: little is known about alzheimer disease at advanced ages, although its incidence continues to increase at least through the ninth decade of life. objective: to examine the effects of age on the relationship between clinical dementia severity and neuropathologic hallmarks in a large sample spanning the full age range. methods: the authors assessed 81 subjects during life for dementia severity, and examined their brains. they analyzed plaque and tangle burden, as well as the activities of the cholinergic marker enzymes acetylcholinesterase (ache) and choline acetyltransferase (chat), in relation to age at death and the clinical severity of dementia. results: dementia severity was strongly related to plaque and tangle burden in relatively young patients (aged <75 years), but this correlation diminished with age and disappeared in the ninth decade of life. among the oldest patients studied, there was no difference in plaque and tangle load between the mild and severe dementia cases. this interaction (p < 0.0001 for plaque density) was not observed for the cholinergic markers chat and ache. conclusion: the nature or expression of alzheimer disease may be different in severely demented older patients, who have equal cholinergic deficits but significantly lower plaque and tangle burden. if confirmed in a prospective study, these findings have diagnostic and therapeutic implications.
analysis of two genomes from the mitochondrion-like organelle of the intestinal parasite blastocystis: complete sequences, gene content, and genome organization this study was prompted by the paradox of strong presence of mitochondria in an anaerobic protozoan, recently reclassified from the yeasts. stemming from publication in 1911 to 1912, blastocystis hominis has been generally accepted as a harmless intestinal yeast of humans, with short standardized textbook (parasitology) descriptions, even to the present day. reports since 1967 have changed the classification of b. hominis from yeast to protozoan (sarcodina), and this has been followed by interest in b. hominis-caused disease, resulting in documentation of disease in humans and other primates. in this study of b. hominis, the basic ultrastructure of the mitochondria was shown by thin-section electron microscopy to be identical to that of an archetypical mitochondrion. there were hundreds of them in large b. hominis cells (100 to 200 microns in diameter). mitochondria were confined to a peripheral ring of cytoplasm bounded by the outer cell membrane (there is no cell wall) and the membrane of the large, spherical, organelle-free central body that constitutes 75% of the cell's volume. mitochondria tended to surround the cell's usual two to four nuclei. rhodamine 123 stained the mitochondria selectively, visualized by fluorescence microscopy. the cell was devoid of cytochromes. addition of 0.1% cytochrome c to the growth medium increased utilization of glucose by 34% and that of lactate by 17%. furthermore, it markedly increased the number of mitochondrion-filled cells. at higher concentrations, cytochrome c inhibited the growth of the cells. despite the presence of large numbers of mitochondria, activities of the mitochondrial enzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, isocitrate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, and cytochrome c oxidase were absent. thus, the function of the mitochondria in b. hominis remains unknown. considerable activities of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were found. aldolase activity was prominent. pyruvate decarboxylase was present. diaphorase and lactate dehydrogenase were detectable but in suspect quantities. other missing enzymes were gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase (a lysosomal marker), and creatine kinase isoenzymes.
biomarkers for melanoma diagnosis and the technologies used to identify them during the past several decades, there has been a substantial increase in the incidence of cutaneous melanoma among all caucasian populations. the number of deaths due to cutaneous malignant melanoma has also increased in most fair‐skinned populations throughout the world in the past few decades. trends in melanoma incidence worldwide are examined. the most recent data on the mortality from cutaneous melanoma are reported. the role of different environmental, genetic and host factors in the aetiology of melanoma is discussed.
design, data, and theory regarding a digital hand inclinometer: a portable device for studying slant perception a dramatic failure of orientation constancy is documented in the perception of downhill slopes. contrary to naïve expectation, steep downhill slopes look shallower from the edge than they do from back from the edge. three experiments document and quantify this failure of constancy for real and virtual surfaces using a variety of dependent measures. two additional studies document overestimation of both non-visually perceived head pitch and perceived gaze declination. a model of orientation constancy failure is fit to the data that combine exaggerations in perceived gaze declination with exaggerated scaling of perceived optical slant. these findings support a functional scale-expansion model of error in slope perception.
ion channels and tranporters in cancer . 2 . ion channels and the control of cancer cell migration the activation of ion channels is crucial during cell movement, including glioblastoma cell invasion in the brain parenchyma. in this context, we describe for the first time the contribution of intermediate conductance ca(2+)-activated k (ik(ca)) channel activity in the chemotactic response of human glioblastoma cell lines, primary cultures, and freshly dissociated tissues to cxc chemokine ligand 12 (cxcl12), a chemokine whose expression in glioblastoma has been correlated with its invasive capacity. we show that blockade of the ik(ca) channel with its specific inhibitor 1-[(2-chlorophenyl) diphenylmethyl]-1h-pyrazole (tram-34) or ik(ca) channel silencing by short hairpin rna (shrna) completely abolished cxcl12-induced cell migration. we further demonstrate that this is not a general mechanism in glioblastoma cell migration since epidermal growth factor (egf), which also activates ik(ca) channels in the glioblastoma-derived cell line gl15, stimulate cell chemotaxis even if the ik(ca) channels have been blocked or silenced. furthermore, we demonstrate that both cxcl12 and egf induce ca(2+) mobilization and ik(ca) channel activation but only cxcl12 induces a long-term upregulation of the ik(ca) channel activity. furthermore, the ca(2+)-chelating agent bapta-am abolished the cxcl12-induced, but not the egf-induced, glioblastoma cell chemotaxis. in addition, we demonstrate that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk)1/2 pathway is only partially implicated in the modulation of cxcl12-induced glioblastoma cell movement, whereas the phosphoinositol-3 kinase (pi3k) pathway is not involved. in contrast, egf-induced glioblastoma migration requires both erk1/2 and pi3k activity. all together these findings suggest that the efficacy of glioblastoma invasiveness might be related to an array of nonoverlapping mechanisms activated by different chemotactic agents.
plant essential oils synergize and antagonize toxicity of different conventional insecticides against myzus persicae (hemiptera: aphididae) in recent years, the use of essential oils (eos) derived from aromatic plants as low-risk insecticides has increased considerably owing to their popularity with organic growers and environmentally conscious consumers. eos are easily produced by steam distillation of plant material and contain many volatile, low-molecular-weight terpenes and phenolics. the major plant families from which eos are extracted include myrtaceae, lauraceae, lamiaceae, and asteraceae. eos have repellent, insecticidal, and growth-reducing effects on a variety of insects. they have been used effectively to control preharvest and postharvest phytophagous insects and as insect repellents for biting flies and for home and garden insects. the compounds exert their activities on insects through neurotoxic effects involving several mechanisms, notably through gaba, octopamine synapses, and the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. with a few exceptions, their mammalian toxicity is low and environmental persistence is short. registration has been the main bottleneck in putting new products on the market, but more eos have been approved for use in the united states than elsewhere owing to reduced-risk processes for these materials.
sensitivity improvement of no-back-plate mems microphone using polysilicon trench-refilled process this study reports a cmos-mems condenser microphone implemented using the standard thin film stacking of 0.35 μm umc cmos 3.3/5.0 v logic process, and followed by post-cmos micromachining steps without introducing any special materials. the corrugated diaphragm for the microphone is designed and implemented using the metal layer to reduce the influence of thin film residual stresses. moreover, a silicon substrate is employed to increase the stiffness of the back-plate. measurements show the sensitivity of microphone is −42 ± 3 dbv/pa at 1 khz (the reference sound-level is 94 db) under 6 v pumping voltage, the frequency response is 100 hz–10 khz, and the s/n ratio >55 db. it also has low power consumption of less than 200 μa, and low distortion of less than 1% (referred to 100 db).
a locally constrained statistical shape model for robust nasal cavity segmentation in computed tomography level set methods have been widely used in image processing and computer vision. in conventional level set formulations, the level set function typically develops irregularities during its evolution, which may cause numerical errors and eventually destroy the stability of the evolution. therefore, a numerical remedy, called reinitialization, is typically applied to periodically replace the degraded level set function with a signed distance function. however, the practice of reinitialization not only raises serious problems as when and how it should be performed, but also affects numerical accuracy in an undesirable way. this paper proposes a new variational level set formulation in which the regularity of the level set function is intrinsically maintained during the level set evolution. the level set evolution is derived as the gradient flow that minimizes an energy functional with a distance regularization term and an external energy that drives the motion of the zero level set toward desired locations. the distance regularization term is defined with a potential function such that the derived level set evolution has a unique forward-and-backward (fab) diffusion effect, which is able to maintain a desired shape of the level set function, particularly a signed distance profile near the zero level set. this yields a new type of level set evolution called distance regularized level set evolution (drlse). the distance regularization effect eliminates the need for reinitialization and thereby avoids its induced numerical errors. in contrast to complicated implementations of conventional level set formulations, a simpler and more efficient finite difference scheme can be used to implement the drlse formulation. drlse also allows the use of more general and efficient initialization of the level set function. in its numerical implementation, relatively large time steps can be used in the finite difference scheme to reduce the number of iterations, while ensuring sufficient numerical accuracy. to demonstrate the effectiveness of the drlse formulation, we apply it to an edge-based active contour model for image segmentation, and provide a simple narrowband implementation to greatly reduce computational cost.
melorheostosis of the thumb and trapezium bone melorheostosis can be associated with various soft tissue lesions of the affected limb. a case is presented in which a severe carpal tunnel syndrome developed in a middle-aged woman with melorheostosis of the right upper limb since childhood.
on the security of mq cryptographic systems for constructing secure internet of medical things cryptographic systems refer to a set of algorithms needed to implement a particular form of encryption, decryption, signature and verification, which have practical applications in engineering area. among cryptographic systems, multivariate public key cryptography (mpkc) is one of the most popular post-quantum candidates since it has the potential to resist quantum computer attacks. mpkc must be protected against a wide range of attacks, including side-channel attack, which is any attack based on information gained from the physical implementation of cryptographic systems. however, there are few side-channel attacks on mpkc schemes. in this paper, we present techniques to exploit differential power analysis and fault analysis attacks for analyzing the effectiveness of side-channel attacks on mpkc schemes. we propose a general model of side-channel attacks on enhanced tame transformation signature (entts) scheme, which is one of the representative mpkc schemes. we implement a naive entts scheme on application specific integrated circuits and propose a successful side-channel attack on the implementation. experimental results show that our attack successfully obtains all the pieces from the private keys of the entts scheme and they clearly demonstrate the importance of protecting mpkc against side-channel attacks.
complete genomic sequence and an infectious bac clone of feline herpesvirus-1 (fhv-1). improving the accuracy of prediction of gene starts is one of a few remaining open problems in computer prediction of prokaryotic genes. its difficulty is caused by the absence of relatively strong sequence patterns identifying true translation initiation sites. in the current paper we show that the accuracy of gene start prediction can be improved by combining models of protein-coding and non-coding regions and models of regulatory sites near gene start within an iterative hidden markov model based algorithm. the new gene prediction method, called genemarks, utilizes a non-supervised training procedure and can be used for a newly sequenced prokaryotic genome with no prior knowledge of any protein or rrna genes. the genemarks implementation uses an improved version of the gene finding program genemark.hmm, heuristic markov models of coding and non-coding regions and the gibbs sampling multiple alignment program. genemarks predicted precisely 83.2% of the translation starts of genbank annotated bacillus subtilis genes and 94.4% of translation starts in an experimentally validated set of escherichia coli genes. we have also observed that genemarks detects prokaryotic genes, in terms of identifying open reading frames containing real genes, with an accuracy matching the level of the best currently used gene detection methods. accurate translation start prediction, in addition to the refinement of protein sequence n-terminal data, provides the benefit of precise positioning of the sequence region situated upstream to a gene start. therefore, sequence motifs related to transcription and translation regulatory sites can be revealed and analyzed with higher precision. these motifs were shown to possess a significant variability, the functional and evolutionary connections of which are discussed.
fetal somatic growth trajectory differs by type of congenital heart disease pre-eclampsia (pree) is a multifaceted complication found uniquely in the pregnant patient and one that has puzzled scientists for years. pree is not a single disorder, but a complex syndrome that is produced by various pathophysiological triggers and mechanisms affecting about 5% of obstetrical patients. pree is a major cause of premature delivery and maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. pree is characterized by de novo development of hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation and affects nearly every organ system, with the most severe consequences being eclampsia, pulmonary edema, intrauterine growth restriction, and thrombocytopenia. pree alters the intrauterine environment by modulating the pattern of hormonal signals and activating the detrimental cellular signaling that has been transported to the fetus. the fetus has to adapt to this intrauterine environment with detrimental signals. the adaptive changes increase the risk of disease later in life. this review defines the predisposition and causes of pree and the cellular signaling detrimental to maternal health during pree. moreover, the risk factors for diseases that are transmitted to the offspring have been addressed in this review. the detrimental signaling molecules that have been overexpressed in pree patients raises the possibility that those signals could be therapeutically blocked one day.
examination of college student achievement within an ecological framework previous authors (e.g., b. r. sarason, shearin, pierce, & sarason, 1987) have found that perceived social support can affect the emotional well-being of an individual. consequently, the effective assessment of social supports is a key issue in both research and clinical practice. the multidimensional scale of perceived social support (mspss; zimet, dahlem, zimet, & farley, 1988) divides perceived social support into 3 distinct constructs-that derived from family members, from friends, and from significant others. this study is the first to assess the mspss using confirmatory factor analysis in both a college student (n = 549) and psychiatric outpatient (n = 156) sample. based on several goodness-of-fit indicators, a 3-factor model for the mspss was supported in both samples, as was a single, higher order domain of global social support. the perceived social support factors of family and friends consistently had the strongest associations with symptomatology. these results support the use of the mspss as a brief instrument for assessing the hierarchical structure of perceived social support in a variety of samples.
finite element modeling of short-wavelength folding on venus: implications for the plume hypothesis for crustal plateau formation crustal plateaus on venus constitute one of that planet’s most intriguing tectonic features. they host so-called “tessera” terrain, or deformed crust exhibiting two or more sets of intersecting tectonic lineaments, which comprises»8% of venus’ surface. major questions surrounding crustal plateaus and tessera terrain include: (1) what is the nature of crustal plateau deformation? what structures are present, and what are their spatial and temporal relations? (2) what is the global distribution of tessera terrain? does it form a global layer under the regional plains, cropping out in crustal plateaus, or is it confined to crustal plateaus? and (3) what are the implications of (1) and (2) for understanding the processes responsible for formation and deformation of crustal plateaus? structural and kinematic analyses reveal that deformation at ovda regio, venus largest crustal plateau, is characterized by linear shallow steep-sided troughs (ribbons), long arcuate long-wavelength folds, short mid-wavelength folds, and wide complex graben. temporal relations between structures lead to a three-phase regional strain history consisting of (1) layer-normal flattening of a thin competent membrane resulting in radially oriented, distributed extension (ribbon formation); (2) modest contraction of a thicker layer (concentric folding at plateau margins, interference folding in the plateau interior); and (3) limited extension localized at fold crests (graben formation). wavelength analysis of ribbons and folds places limits on the thickness of the competent layer during each stage of deformation and reflects an early shallow brittle‐ductile transition (bdt) that deepened with time. ovda’s deformation, topography, and gravity are all spatially correlated, strongly suggesting a genetic relationship between surface deformation and processes causing crustal thickening and plateau uplift. thus tessera terrain at ovda regio is likely confined to the topographically high plateau and does not extend beneath the surrounding regional plains. similar patterns persist at other crustal plateaus, indicating that tessera terrain is in general confined to crustal plateaus and does not form a globally continuous layer. ovda’s structures, their spatial and temporal relations, the resulting strain history, and the behavior of the bdt through time support a model of mantle plume upwelling in a thin lithospheric regime for crustal plateau formation and contradict previous downwelling models. similarities between structural and kinematic trends at ovda regio and other crustal plateaus lend support to this idea. c ∞ 1999 academic press
turnover rate of the γ-aminobutyric acid transporter gat1 intracellular recordings were made from ca1 pyramidal cells in the rat hippocampal slice to study the processes that influence the time course of inhibitory post‐synaptic potentials (i.p.s.p.s) mediated by gamma‐aminobutyric acid (gaba), and conductance changes evoked by ionophoretically applied gaba. the gaba‐uptake inhibitors, nipecotic acid and cis‐4‐oh‐nipecotic acid (1 mm), greatly prolonged conductance increases associated with both hyperpolarizing and depolarizing responses to ionophoretically applied gaba. in contrast to their effects on gaba‐evoked conductances, uptake inhibitors only slightly prolonged antidromically evoked i.p.s.p.s. their primary effect occurred after the i.p.s.p. had decayed to 5‐30% of its peak. 4‐oh‐isonipecotic acid, a nipecotic acid analogue that does not inhibit gaba uptake, did not prolong i.p.s.p.s or ionophoretically evoked conductance changes. sodium pentobarbitone (100 microm), a drug that prolongs the open time of gaba‐activated chloride channels, potentiated both i.p.s.p.s and responses to ionophoretically applied gaba. whereas pentobarbitone also prolonged i.p.s.p.s, it did not prolong responses to ionophoretically applied gaba. the prolongation of i.p.s.p.s by pentobarbitone occurred equally in both the early and late phases of the i.p.s.p., in contrast to the effects of gaba‐uptake inhibitors. i.p.s.p.s did not usually decay exponentially. the observation that uptake inhibitors prolonged the late but not the early decay phase of the i.p.s.p., together with the previous finding that the conductance change persists for the duration of the i.p.s.p., indicate that gaba is present in the synapse throughout much of the i.p.s.p. these data suggest that diffusion of gaba out of the synapse, a non‐exponential process, is an important determinant of the i.p.s.p. decay time course. increasing the extracellular potassium concentration from 3.5 to 8.5 mm resulted in spontaneously occurring, synchronous burst firing of pyramidal cells. cis‐4‐oh‐nipecotic acid significantly reduced the number and amplitude of extracellularly recorded population spikes within each burst. we conclude that diffusion, channel open time and gaba uptake all influence the time course of gaba‐mediated i.p.s.p.s. the time course of a single, brief i.p.s.p. is determined predominantly by post‐synaptic channel kinetics and diffusion of gaba out of the synapse, whereas the inhibition produced by prolonged synaptic bursts or relatively long application of exogenous gaba can be markedly influenced by gaba uptake.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
effects of polyploidy and reproductive mode on life history trait expression chromosome evolution in flowering plants is often punctuated by polyploidy, genome duplication events that fundamentally alter dna content, chromosome number, and gene dosage. polyploidy confers postzygotic reproductive isolation and is thought to drive ecological divergence and range expansion. the adaptive value of polyploidy, however, remains uncertain; ecologists have traditionally relied on observational methods that cannot distinguish effects of polyploidy per se from genic differences that accumulate after genome duplication. here i use an experimental approach to test how polyploidy mediates ecological divergence in achillea borealis (asteraceae), a widespread tetraploid plant with localized hexaploid populations. in coastal california, tetraploids and hexaploids occupy mesic grassland and xeric dune habitats, respectively. using field transplant experiments with wild-collected plants, i show that hexaploids have a fivefold fitness advantage over tetraploids in dune habitats. parallel experiments with neohexaploids—first-generation mutants screened from a tetraploid genetic background—reveal that a 70% fitness advantage is achieved via genome duplication per se. these results suggest that genome duplication transforms features of a. borealis in a manner that confers adaptation to a novel environment.
testing mendelian inheritance from field-collected parasites: revealing duplicated loci enables correct inference of reproductive mode and mating system. abstract.reproduction is essential to all organisms if they are to contribute to the next generation. there are various means and ways of achieving this goal. this review focuses on the role of asexual reproduction for eukaryotic organisms and how its integration in a life cycle can influence their population genetics and evolution. an important question for evolutionary biologists as to why some organisms reproduce sexually, as opposed to asexually, is addressed. we also discuss the economic and medical importance of asexual organisms.
a comparison of standard and compositional data analysis in studies addressing group differences in sedentary behavior and physical activity the associations between time spent in sleep, sedentary behaviors (sb) and physical activity with health are usually studied without taking into account that time is finite during the day, so time spent in each of these behaviors are codependent. therefore, little is known about the combined effect of time spent in sleep, sb and physical activity, that together constitute a composite whole, on obesity and cardio-metabolic health markers. cross-sectional analysis of nhanes 2005–6 cycle on n = 1937 adults, was undertaken using a compositional analysis paradigm, which accounts for this intrinsic codependence. time spent in sb, light intensity (lipa) and moderate to vigorous activity (mvpa) was determined from accelerometry and combined with self-reported sleep time to obtain the 24 hour time budget composition. the distribution of time spent in sleep, sb, lipa and mvpa is significantly associated with bmi, waist circumference, triglycerides, plasma glucose, plasma insulin (all p<0.001), and systolic (p<0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (p<0.003), but not hdl or ldl. within the composition, the strongest positive effect is found for the proportion of time spent in mvpa. strikingly, the effects of mvpa replacing another behavior and of mvpa being displaced by another behavior are asymmetric. for example, re-allocating 10 minutes of sb to mvpa was associated with a lower waist circumference by 0.001% but if 10 minutes of mvpa is displaced by sb this was associated with a 0.84% higher waist circumference. the proportion of time spent in lipa and sb were detrimentally associated with obesity and cardiovascular disease markers, but the association with sb was stronger. for diabetes risk markers, replacing sb with lipa was associated with more favorable outcomes. time spent in mvpa is an important target for intervention and preventing transfer of time from lipa to sb might lessen the negative effects of physical inactivity.
improved analysis of long-term monitoring data demonstrates marked regional declines of bat populations in the eastern united states white-nose syndrome (wns) is a condition associated with an unprecedented bat mortality event in the northeastern united states. since the winter of 2006*2007, bat declines exceeding 75% have been observed at surveyed hibernacula. affected bats often present with visually striking white fungal growth on their muzzles, ears, and/or wing membranes. direct microscopy and culture analyses demonstrated that the skin of wns-affected bats is colonized by a psychro-philic fungus that is phylogenetically related to geomyces spp. but with a conidial morphology distinct from characterized members of this genus. this report characterizes the cutaneous fungal infection associated with wns.
use of daptomycin to treat infections with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus isolates having vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations of 1.5 to 2 µg/ml abstract there is growing concern that vancomycin has diminished activity for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) infections, with vancomycin mics at the high end of the clsi susceptibility range. despite this growing concern, there are limited clinical data to support this notion. to better elucidate this, a retrospective cohort study was conducted among patients with mrsa bloodstream infections who were treated with vancomycin between january 2005 and may 2007. the inclusion criteria were as follows: at least 18 years old, nonneutropenic, with an mrsa culture that met the cdc criteria for bloodstream infection, had received vancomycin therapy within 48 h of the index blood culture, and survived >24 h after vancomycin administration. failure was defined as 30-day mortality, bacteremia ≥10 days on vancomycin therapy, or a recurrence of mrsa bacteremia within 60 days of vancomycin discontinuation. classification and regression tree (cart) analysis identified the vancomycin mic breakpoint associated with an increased probability of failure. during the study period, 92 patients met the inclusion criteria. the vancomycin mic breakpoint derived by cart analysis was ≥1.5 mg/liter. the 66 patients with vancomycin mics of ≥1.5 mg/liter had a 2.4-fold increase in failure compared to patients with mics of ≤1.0 mg/liter (36.4% and 15.4%, respectively; p = 0.049). in the poisson regression, a vancomycin mic of ≥1.5 mg/liter was independently associated with failure (adjusted risk ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 5.4; p = 0.01). these data strongly suggest that patients with mrsa bloodstream infections with vancomycin mics of ≥1.5 mg/liter respond poorly to vancomycin. alternative anti-mrsa therapies should be considered for these patients.
ultrasonic vocalization in the common marmoset ( callithrix jacchus ) the general concept of animal welfare embraces a continuum between negative/bad welfare and positive/good welfare. early approaches to defining animal welfare were mainly based on the exclusion of negative states, neglecting the fact that during evolution animals optimised their ability to interact with and adapt to their environment(s). an animal's welfare status might best be represented by the adaptive value of the individual's interaction with a given environmental setting but this dynamic welfare concept has significant implications for practical welfare assessments. animal welfare issues cannot simply be addressed by means of objective biological measurements of an animal's welfare status under certain circumstances. in practice, interpretation of welfare status and its translation into the active management of perceived welfare issues are both strongly influenced by context and, especially, by cultural and societal values. in assessing whether or not a given welfare status is morally acceptable, animal welfare scientists must be aware that scientifically based, operational definitions of animal welfare will necessarily be influenced strongly by a given society's moral understanding.
‘ballroom itself can either make you or break you’ – black gbt youths’ psychosocial development in the house ball community objectives i incorporated qualitative methods to explore how hiv-related stigma functions in new york city's house and ball community (hbc).   methods from january through march 2009, i conducted 20 in-depth 1-on-1 interviews with a diverse sample of new york city hbc members. interviews addressed perceptions of hiv-related stigma, the treatment of hiv-positive members in the community, and the potential impact of hiv-related stigma on risk behaviors.   results hiv-related stigma contributes to a loss of moral experience for hbc members. moral experience (i.e., threats to what really matters in a community) disrupts established social connections and hinders the attainment of "ball status" (i.e., amassing social recognition) in the local world of these individuals.   conclusions my recommendations address hiv-related stigma in the new york city hbc from the vantage of moral experience and highlight the need for longitudinal studies of individual house members and for the implementation of stigma-focused interventions in the community that utilize the unique ball status hierarchy and hbc network to influence social norms surrounding the treatment of hiv-positive community members.

platelet-activating factor and oxidized phosphatidylcholines do not suppress endotoxin-induced pro-inflammatory signaling among human myeloid and endothelial cells three lines of evidence are presented that low density lipoproteins gently extracted from human and rabbit atherosclerotic lesions (lesion ldl) greatly resembles ldl that has been oxidatively modified in vitro. first, lesion ldl showed many of the physical and chemical properties of oxidized ldl, properties that differ from those of plasma ldl: higher electrophoretic mobility, a higher density, higher free cholesterol content, and a higher proportion of sphingomyelin and lysophosphatidylcholine in the phospholipid fraction. a number of lower molecular weight fragments of apo b were found in lesion ldl, similar to in vitro oxidized ldl. second, both the intact apo b and some of the apo b fragments of lesion ldl reacted in western blots with antisera that recognize malondialdehyde-conjugated lysine and 4-hydroxynonenal lysine adducts, both of which are found in oxidized ldl; plasma ldl and ldl from normal human intima showed no such reactivity. third, lesion ldl shared biological properties with oxidized ldl: compared with plasma ldl, lesion ldl produced much greater stimulation of cholesterol esterification and was degraded more rapidly by macrophages. degradation of radiolabeled lesion ldl was competitively inhibited by unlabeled lesion ldl, by ldl oxidized with copper, by polyinosinic acid and by malondialdehyde-ldl, but not by native ldl, indicating uptake by the scavenger receptor(s). finally, lesion ldl (but not normal intimal ldl or plasma ldl) was chemotactic for monocytes, as is oxidized ldl. these studies provide strong evidence that atherosclerotic lesions, both in man and in rabbit, contain oxidatively modified ldl.
the fate of brca1-related germline mutations in triple-negative breast tumors. although brca1 function is essential for maintaining genomic integrity in all cell types, it is unclear why increased risk of cancer in individuals harbouring deleterious mutations in brca1 is restricted to only a select few tissues. here we show that human mammary epithelial cells (hmecs) from brca1-mutation carriers (brca1mut/+) exhibit increased genomic instability and rapid telomere erosion in the absence of tumour-suppressor loss. furthermore, we uncover a novel form of haploinsufficiency-induced senescence (his) specific to epithelial cells, which is triggered by prb pathway activation rather than p53 induction. his and telomere erosion in hmecs correlate with misregulation of sirt1 leading to increased levels of acetylated prb as well as acetylated h4k16 both globally and at telomeric regions. these results identify a novel form of cellular senescence and provide a potential molecular basis for the rapid cell- and tissue- specific predisposition of breast cancer development associated with brca1 haploinsufficiency.
specialization of binaural responses in ventral auditory cortices the acoustical cues for sound location are generated by spatial- and frequency-dependent filtering of propagating sound waves by the head and external ears. although rats have been a common model system for anatomy, physiology, and psychophysics of localization, there have been few studies of the acoustical cues available to rats. here, directional transfer functions (dtfs), the directional components of the head-related transfer functions, were measured in six adult rats. the cues to location were computed from the dtfs. in the frontal hemisphere, spectral notches were present for frequencies from approximately 16 to 30 khz; in general, the frequency corresponding to the notch increased with increases in source elevation and in azimuth toward the ipsilateral ear. the maximum high-frequency envelope-based interaural time differences (itds) were 130 mus, whereas low-frequency (<3.5 khz) fine-structure itds were 160 mus; both types of itds were larger than predicted from spherical head models. interaural level differences (ilds) strongly depended on location and frequency. maximum ilds were <10 db for frequencies <8 khz and were as large as 20-40 db for frequencies >20 khz. removal of the pinna eliminated the spectral notches, reduced the acoustic gain and ilds, altered the acoustical axis, and reduced the itds.
effect of clove and holybasil essential oil on sensory and microbiological quality of fresh chicken sausages meat is frequently associated with a "negative" health image due to its "high" fat content and in the case of red meat is seen as a cancer-promoting food. therefore, a low meat intake, especially red meat is recommended to avoid the risk of cancer, obesity and metabolic syndrome. however, this discussion overlooks the fact, that meat is an important source for some of micronutrients such as iron, selenium, vitamins a, b12 and folic acid. these micronutrients are either not present in plant derived food or have poor bioavailability. in addition, meat as a protein rich and carbohydrate "low" product contributes to a low glycemic index which is assumed to be "beneficial" with respect to overweight, the development of diabetes and cancer (insulin resistance hypothesis). taken together meat is an important nutrient for human health and development. as an essential part of a mixed diet, meat ensures adequate delivery of essential micronutrients and amino acids and is involved in regulatory processes of energy metabolism.
investigating genome wide patterns of natural selection in eukaryotes the distribution of fitness effects of new mutations is a fundamental parameter in genetics. here we present a new method by which the distribution can be estimated. the method is fairly robust to changes in population size and admixture, and it can be corrected for any residual effects if a model of the demography is available. we apply the method to extensively sampled single-nucleotide polymorphism data from humans and estimate the distribution of fitness effects for amino acid changing mutations. we show that a gamma distribution with a shape parameter of 0.23 provides a good fit to the data and we estimate that >50% of mutations are likely to have mild effects, such that they reduce fitness by between one one-thousandth and one-tenth. we also infer that <15% of new mutations are likely to have strongly deleterious effects. we estimate that on average a nonsynonymous mutation reduces fitness by a few percent and that the average strength of selection acting against a nonsynonymous polymorphism is ∼9 × 10−5. we argue that the relaxation of natural selection due to modern medicine and reduced variance in family size is not likely to lead to a rapid decline in genetic quality, but that it will be very difficult to locate most of the genes involved in complex genetic diseases.
value of exercise tolerance testing in evaluation of diabetic patients presented with atypical chest discomfort aggressive medical therapy can be justified in most patients with diabetes, but there may be some higher-risk asymptomatic patients who could benefit from revascularization and/or medical therapy for myocardial ischemia. silent myocardial ischemia (smi) might be used to identify these high-risk individuals. in this review we define smi as objective evidence of ischemia from any noninvasive test occurring in an asymptomatic patient. we outline what is known about asymptomatic coronary heart disease (chd) in diabetes and how this relates to smi. we examine how smi predicts angiographic chd and chd events, and we describe the changing role of chd screening as reflected by various guidelines. we identify the recent research suggesting that there may be substantial numbers of high-risk asymptomatic patients who have diabetes with undiagnosed chd and who could benefit from more-active intervention; however, with the recent advances in medical therapy, and the uncertain benefits of screening, current guidelines strongly discourage this practice, except in limited clinical situations, such as before major surgery. carefully conducted clinical trails using state-of-the-art investigations and therapy in well-characterized patients with diabetes are urgently required to inform physicians on when and how to intervene.
number of days required to estimate habitual activity using wrist-worn geneactiv accelerometer: a cross-sectional study purpose to examine sources of variance in objective measures of physical activity in a group of healthy adults (n = 92) participating in a physical activity measurement study.   methods physical activity was assessed for up to 21 consecutive days using the computer science applications (csa) accelerometer. day-of-the-week effects were evaluated for activity counts (ct.min(-1).d(-1), ct.d(-1)) and time (min.d(-1)) spent in inactivity (0-499 ct), moderate-1 (500-1951 ct), and moderate-2-vigorous activity (> or =1952 ct). random effects models were employed to estimate variance components for subject, day of the week, and residual error from which the number of days of assessment required to achieve 80% reliability were estimated.   results physical inactivity was lower on weekend days, and saturday was the least inactive day of the week for both men and women. inter-individual variation, or differences between subjects, was proportionally the largest source of variance (55-60% of total) in accelerometer counts and time spent in moderate to vigorous activity. differences within subjects (intra-individual variation) accounted for 30-45% of the overall variance, and day-of-the-week effects accounted for 1-8%. for activity counts, and time spent in moderate to vigorous activity, at least 3-4 d of monitoring were required to achieve 80% reliability. reliable measures of physical inactivity required at least 7 d of monitoring.   conclusion these findings provide insight for understanding the behavioral variability in the activity patterns of adults and suggest that reliable measures of activity behaviors require at least 7 d of monitoring.
contribution of prior semantic knowledge to new episodic learning in amnesia the present study examined how younger and older adults remember price information. participants studied grocery items that were priced at market value or were well above or below market value. although younger adults displayed better recall performance for unrealistic prices than older adults, there was no age difference for realistic prices, and both groups were equally accurate at remembering the general price range of the items. the results suggest that when older adults can rely on prior knowledge and schematic support, and tasks involve naturalistic materials, memory for associative information can be as good as that of younger adults.
predictors of caregiver burden in primary caregivers of chronic patients the purpose of this study was to provide an in-depth description of taking care, one of the phases of a grounded theory (the labor of caregiving) of caregiving for families experiencing life-threatening illnesses such as cancer and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids). in-depth interviews were conducted with 26 family caregivers of persons with cancer and aids during a 4-month period. grounded theory methodology served as the basis for data collection and analysis. data were analyzed in terms of the strategies, consequences, and interactions involved in the caregiving experience. the strategies of taking care included these data themes: managing the illness, facing and preparing for dying, and managing the environment. the consequences of taking care included the data themes coming to know one's own strength, and personal suffering. interactions that occurred as a result of taking care included responding to family relationship issues, and struggling with the health care system. findings from this research reveal that family caregivers dedicate an enormous portion of their lives to caring for their ill family members. they experience their own form of suffering as they watch their loved one die. some also find personal meaning in the experience and an awakening of their own strengths. one of the implications from these findings is the need for a partnership between health care professionals and the families providing care.
ultrasonographic and magnetic resonance imaging diagnosis of an oropharyngeal wood penetrating injury in a dog. objective the purpose of this study was to identify the characteristic imaging features of wooden foreign bodies.   materials and methods the imaging studies of 12 patients with surgically confirmed wooden foreign bodies were retrospectively reviewed. the study group consisted of seven females and five males, 10-65 years old (mean age, 36 years). all patients underwent radiography. nine patients were evaluated with sonography, eight with mr imaging, three with ct, and one with ct arthrography. gadolinium-enhanced mr imaging was performed in six patients. three patients presented with a draining sinus and nine with painful swelling. only three patients presented with a history of penetrating injury.   results lesions were located in the foot (n = 4), hand (n = 3), thigh (n = 2), calf (n = 2), and elbow (n = 1). radiographs failed to reveal the retained foreign bodies in all patients. with mr imaging, wooden foreign bodies displayed a variable signal intensity that was equal to or less than that of skeletal muscle on both t1- and t2-weighted images. mr imaging showed the surrounding inflammatory response in all patients. ct showed the retained wood as linear cylindric foci of increased attenuation. wood was highly echogenic and revealed pronounced acoustic shadowing on sonography. arthrography in one patient showed an associated reactive synovitis.   conclusion the imaging appearance of wooden foreign bodies is variable; however, imaging can be quite specific, and when taken in the appropriate clinical setting, the imaging should reliably suggest the diagnosis. sonography is frequently underused but proved most useful for the evaluation of retained wooden foreign bodies.
rna polymerase elongation factors. the universal bacterial transcription elongation factor nusa mediates elongation activities of rna polymerase. by itself, nusa induces transcription pausing and facilitates intrinsic termination, but nusa also is a cofactor of antiterminators that antagonize pausing and prevent termination. we show that nusa is required for lambda-related phage 82 antiterminator q(82) to construct a stable complex in which rna-based termination mechanisms have restricted access to the emerging transcript; this result suggests a locale for both q(82) and nusa near the beta flap domain of rna polymerase. furthermore, as nusa is not required for the antipausing activity of q(82) in vitro, we distinguish two distinct activities of antiterminators, namely antipausing and rna occlusion, and discuss their roles in q(82) function.
herg k+ channel-associated cardiac effects of the antidepressant drug desipramine the diamidine pentamidine is used to treat leishmaniasis, trypanosomiasis, and pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. treatment may be accompanied by prolongation of the qt interval of the electrocardiogram and torsades de pointes tachycardias. up to now, it has been thought that therapeutic compounds causing qt prolongation are associated with direct block of the cardiac potassium channel human ether a-go-go-related gene (herg), which encodes the α subunit of cardiac ikr currents. we show that pentamidine has no acute effects on currents produced by herg, kvlqt1/mink, kv4.3, or scna5. cardiac calcium currents and the guinea pig cardiac action potential were also not affected. after overnight exposure, however, pentamidine reduced herg currents and inhibited trafficking and maturation of herg with ic50 values of 5 to 8 μm similar to therapeutic concentrations. surface expression determined in a chemiluminescence assay was reduced on exposure to 10, 30, and 100 μm pentamidine by about 30, 40, and 70%, respectively. these effects were specific for herg since expression of hkv1.5, kvlqt1/mink, and kv4.3 was not altered. in isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes, 10 μm pentamidine prolonged action potential duration apd90 from 374.3 ± 57.1 to 893.9 ± 86.2 ms on overnight incubation. ikr tail current density was reduced from 0.61 ± 0.09 to 0.39 ± 0.04 pa/pf. we conclude that pentamidine prolongs the cardiac action potential by block of herg trafficking and reduction of the number of functional herg channels at the cell surface. we propose that pentamidine, like arsenic trioxide, produces qt prolongation and torsades de pointes in patients by inhibition of herg trafficking.
high doses of medroxyprogesterone as the cause of disappearance of adherence of the zona pellucida to an oocyte the nuclei of spermatozoa leaving the testies are transcritionally inactivated and are structurally stabilised by extensive association of sperm dna with protamines, highly basic proteins that replace somatic histones during spermiogenesis. during sperm matureation within teh epididymis, protamine–sh is oxidised to -ss-(bedford & calvin, 1974).
cyclosporin a disrupts notch signaling and vascular lumen maintenance the notch and calcineurin/nfat pathways have both been implicated in control of keratinocyte differentiation. induction of the p21(waf1/cip1) gene by notch 1 activation in differentiating keratinocytes is associated with direct targeting of the rbp-jkappa protein to the p21 promoter. we show here that notch 1 activation functions also through a second calcineurin-dependent mechanism acting on the p21 tata box-proximal region. increased calcineurin/nfat activity by notch signaling involves downregulation of calcipressin, an endogenous calcineurin inhibitor, through a hes-1-dependent mechanism. besides control of the p21 gene, calcineurin contributes significantly to the transcriptional response of keratinocytes to notch 1 activation, both in vitro and in vivo. in fact, deletion of the calcineurin b1 gene in the skin results in a cyclic alopecia phenotype, associated with altered expression of notch-responsive genes involved in hair follicle structure and/or adhesion to the surrounding mesenchyme. thus, an important interconnection exists between notch 1 and calcineurin-nfat pathways in keratinocyte growth/differentiation control.
hmga proteins promote atm expression and enhance cancer cell resistance to genotoxic agents the high mobility group hmga1 protein belongs to a family of architectural factors that play a role in chromosomal organisation and gene transcription regulation. hmga1 overexpression represents a common feature of human malignant tumours and is causally associated with neoplastic transformation and metastatic progression. recently, hmga1 expression has been correlated with the presence of chromosomal rearrangements and suggested to promote genomic instability. here, we report a novel interaction between hmga1 protein and the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (atm) kinase, the major key player in the cellular response to dna damage caused by several agents such as ionising radiation (ir). we identified an sq motif on hmga1, which is effectively phosphorylated by atm in vitro and in vivo. interestingly, confocal microscopy revealed that hmga1 colocalises with the activated form of atm (atm s1981p). moreover, hmga1 ectopic expression decreases cell survival following exposure to ir as assessed by clonogenic survival in mcf-7 cells, further supporting the hypothesis that hmga1 might act as a downstream target of the atm pathway in response to dna damage.
bioremediation strategies for removal of residual atrazine in the boreal groundwater zone the following study evaluated the diversity and biogeography of 83 new atrazine-degrading bacteria and the composition of their atrazine degradation genes. these strains were isolated from 13 agricultural soils and grouped according to rep-pcr genomic fingerprinting into 11 major clusters, which showed biogeographic patterns. three clusters (54 strains) belonged to the genus arthrobacter, seven clusters (28 strains) were similar to the genus nocardioides and only one strain was a gram-negative from the genus ancylobacter. pcr assays for the detection of the genes atza, b, c, d, e, f and trzn conducted with each of the 83 strains revealed that 82 strains (all gram positive) possessed trzn, 74 of them possessed the combination of trzn, atzb and atzc, while only the gram-negative strain had atza. a similar pcr assay for the two analogous genes, atza and trzn, responsible for the first step of atrazine degradation, was performed with dna extracted directly from the enrichment cultures and microcosms spiked with atrazine. in these assays, the gene trzn was detected in each culture, while atza was detected in only six out of 13 soils. these results raise an interesting hypothesis on the evolutionary ecology of the two atrazine chlorohydrolase genes (i.e. atza and trzn) and about the biogeography of atrazine-degrading bacteria.
reproducibility of in vivo corneal confocal microscopy using an automated analysis program for detection of diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy objective we aimed to determine the corneal confocal microscopy (ccm) parameter that best identifies diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy (dsp) in type 1 diabetes and to describe its performance characteristics. research design and methods concurrent with clinical and electrophysiological examination for classification of dsp, ccm was performed on 89 type 1 diabetic and 64 healthy subjects to determine corneal nerve fiber length (cnfl), density, tortuosity, and branch density. area under the curve (auc) and optimal thresholds for dsp identification in those with diabetes were determined by receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve analysis. results dsp was present in 33 (37%) subjects. with the exception of tortuosity, ccm parameters were significantly lower in dsp case subjects. in roc curve analysis, auc was greatest for cnfl (0.88) compared with fiber density (0.84, p = 0.0001), branch density (0.73, p < 0.0001), and tortuosity (0.55, p < 0.0001). the threshold value that optimized sensitivity and specificity for ruling in dsp was a cnfl of ≤14.0 mm/mm2 (sensitivity 85%, specificity 84%), associated with positive and negative likelihood ratios of 5.3 and 0.18. an alternate approach that used separate threshold values maximized sensitivity (threshold value ≥15.8 mm/mm2, sensitivity 91%, negative likelihood ratio 0.16) and specificity (≤11.5 mm/mm2, specificity 93%, positive likelihood ratio 8.5). conclusions among ccm parameters, cnfl best discriminated dsp cases from control subjects. a single threshold offers clinically acceptable operating characteristics, although a strategy that uses separate thresholds to respectively rule in and rule out dsp has excellent performance while minimizing unclassified subjects. we hypothesize that values between these thresholds indicate incipient nerve injury that represents those individuals at future neuropathy risk.

μ opiate receptor gene dose effects on different morphine actions: evidence for differential in vivo μ receptor reserve the μ opioid receptor is thought to be the cellular target of opioid narcotics such as morphine and heroin, mediating their effects in both pain relief and euphoria. its involvement is also implicated in a range of diverse biological processes. using a mouse model in which the receptor gene was disrupted by targeted homologous recombination, we explored the involvement of this receptor in a number of physiological functions. mice homozygous for the disrupted gene developed normally, but their motor function was altered. drug-naive homozygotes displayed reduced locomotor activity, and morphine did not induce changes in locomotor activity observed in wild-type mice. unexpectedly, lack of a functional receptor resulted in changes in both the host defense system and the reproductive system. we observed increased proliferation of granulocyte-macrophage, erythroid, and multipotential progenitor cells in both bone marrow and spleen, indicating a link between hematopoiesis and the opioid system, both of which are stress-responsive systems. unexpected changes in sexual function in male homozygotes were also observed, as shown by reduced mating activity, a decrease in sperm count and motility, and smaller litter size. taken together, these results suggest a novel role of the μ opioid receptor in hematopoiesis and reproductive physiology, in addition to its known involvement in pain relief.
her2 protein overexpression and gene amplification in upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma-an analysis of 171 patients. cells are continuously exposed to diverse stimuli ranging from soluble endocrine and paracrine factors, to signaling molecules on neighboring cells. it is of great importance that these extracellular signals are correctly interpreted by the cell, in order to achieve an appropriate developmental or proliferative response. receptors of the tyrosine kinase family play pivotal roles in this process. by binding to specific peptide ligands they are able to integrate these external stimuli with internal signal transduction pathways, contributing in this fashion to the ability of the cell to respond correctly to its environment. in this review, we will concentrate on the role of erbb receptors as normal signal transducers and their contribution to the process of malignant transformation during tumor development.  erbb proteins belong to subclass i of the superfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases (rtks). there are four members of the erbb family: epidermal growth factor (egf) receptor (also termed erbb1/her1), erbb2/neu/her2, erbb3/her3 and erbb4/her4. we will refer to them, henceforth, as the erbb receptors. all family members have in common an extracellular ligand‐binding domain, a single membrane‐spanning region and a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase domain. a family of ligands, the egf‐related peptide growth factors, bind the extracellular domain of erbb receptors leading to the formation of both homo‐ and heterodimers. dimerization consequently stimulates the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the receptors and triggers autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain. these phosphorylated residues serve as docking sites for signaling molecules involved in the regulation of intracellular signaling cascades. ultimately, downstream effects on gene expression determine the biological response to receptor activation.  erbb receptors are expressed in a variety of tissues of epithelial, mesenchymal and neuronal origin, where they play fundamental roles in development, proliferation and differentiation. moreover, deregulated expression of erbb receptors, in particular erbb1 and erbb2, has …

influence of β-tricalcium phosphate granule size and morphology on tissue reaction in vivo. the regeneration of bone remains an elusive yet important goal in the field of orthopaedic surgery. despite its limitations, autogenous cancellous bone grafting continues to the most effective means by which bone healing is enhanced clinically. biosynthetic bone grafts currently are being developed as an alternative to autogenous bone grafting. these grafts generally contain one or more of three critical components: (1) osteoprogenitor cells; (2) an osteoconductive matrix; and (3) osteoinductive growth factors. the importance of each of these components based on preclinical data supports their use in biosynthetic bone grafts. the use of growth factors such as bone morphogenetic proteins, transforming growth factor, platelet derived growth factor, and fibroblastic growth factor is reviewed in preclinical long bone defect and spinal fusion models. the use of bone marrow in preclinical and clinical settings is presented with specific emphasis given to the use of bone marrow as a source of osteoprogenitor cells and how the use of these cells can be enhanced with the use of bone morphogenetic protein-2. these data support the concept that although products that contain only one of the three key components of a bone graft may regenerate bone successfully, composites of the three key components will be more successful clinically.
elastic stabilisation of proximal humeral fractures with a new percutaneous angular stable fixation device (buttonfix®): a preliminary report objective reduction and fixation of displaced fractures of the humeral head by percutaneous methods. early functional postoperative management.   indications simple subcapital fractures of the humerus, ao 11a2, a3. multifragmentary fractures of the proximal humerus, ao 11b1, b2, c1, (c2).   contraindications head split fractures. fracture dislocations. severe osteoporosis.   surgical technique the head fragment, generally impacted in valgus, is lifted by means of an elevator inserted percutaneously. the head is brought into the correct position and fixed to the shaft with two crossed kirschner wires. the kirschner wires are clamped into a locking device attached to the lateral cortex of the humerus by one screw to prevent slippage. displaced tubercles are also reduced percutaneously by the aid of small bone hooks and are stabilized by insertion of cannulated screws.   postoperative management shoulder bandage for 3 weeks. depending on the stability achieved during operation gentle exercising can be commenced from the 1st postoperative day with the arm bandaged.   results 200 patients (78 men, 122 women) were followed up at least 2 years (24-81 months) postoperatively. the average age was 61.6 years (14-103 years). the average constant score for four-part fractures was 87%. 24% of the patients had to be operated on a second time (shortening of the wires or reosteosyntheses). in 8.5% secondary change of management was necessary. in 3% clinically relevant avascular head necrosis occurred, and pseudarthrosis in 3%.

physical constraints on the evolution of cooperation a model is presented to account for the natural selection of what is termed reciprocally altruistic behavior. the model shows how selection can operate against the cheater (non-reciprocator) in the system. three instances of altruistic behavior are discussed, the evolution of which the model can explain: (1) behavior involved in cleaning symbioses; (2) warning cries in birds; and (3) human reciprocal altruism. regarding human reciprocal altruism, it is shown that the details of the psychological system that regulates this altruism can be explained by the model. specifically, friendship, dislike, moralistic aggression, gratitude, sympathy, trust, suspicion, trustworthiness, aspects of guilt, and some forms of dishonesty and hypocrisy can be explained as important adaptations to regulate the altruistic system. each individual human is seen as possessing altruistic and cheating tendencies, the expression of which is sensitive to developmental variables that were selected to set the tendencies at a balance appropriate to the local social and ecological environment.
neuronal α-bungarotoxin receptors are α7 subunit homomers it has recently been demonstrated that alpha-bungarotoxin receptors, which behave as functional nicotinic receptors, are present in chick cns. in this paper, we report the purification and characterization of a functional alpha-bungarotoxin receptor from chick cerebellum, a nervous tissue in which a clear inhibition of induced nicotine effects has been reported in vivo. this receptor contains at least three subunits of apparent mol. wt 52,000, 57,000 and 67,000. the use of monoclonal antibodies specific for the alpha 7 subunit demonstrated that 75% of the molecules present in our purified preparation belong to the alpha 7 subtype and that this antibody labels the 57,000 band in western blot, thus indicating that this is the toxin binding subunit. reconstruction experiments in planar lipid bilayers show that this alpha-bungarotoxin receptor forms a cation selective channel whose opening is blocked by d-tubocurarine. binding experiments on immobilized receptors over an alpha-bungarotoxin-sepharose affinity column show that the ligand binding subunit is present in vivo in two copies per receptor. immunological, pharmacological and functional experiments show that this purified receptor is very similar, but not identical, to the previously characterized chick optic lobe receptor, thus indicating the heterogeneity of these alpha-bungarotoxin receptors in the cns.
arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities show low resistance and high resilience to wildfire disturbance invasions by non-native plants can alter ecosystem functions and reduce native plant diversity, but relatively little is known about their effect on belowground microbial communities. we show that invasions by knapweed (centaurea stoebe) and leafy spurge (euphorbia esula, hereafter spurge)—but not cheatgrass (bromus tectorum)—support a higher abundance and diversity of symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (amf) than multi-species native plant communities. the higher amf richness associated with knapweed and spurge is unlikely due to a co-invasion by amf, because a separate sampling showed that individual native forbs hosted a similar amf abundance and richness as exotic forbs. native grasses associated with fewer amf taxa, which could explain the reduced amf richness in native, grass-dominated communities. the three invasive plant species harbored distinct amf communities, and analyses of co-occurring native and invasive plants indicate that differences were partly driven by the invasive plants and were not the result of pre-invasion conditions. our results suggest that invasions by mycotrophic plants that replace poorer hosts can increase amf abundance and richness. the high amf richness in monodominant plant invasions also indicates that the proposed positive relationship between above and belowground diversity is not always strong. finally, the disparate responses among exotic plants and consistent results between grasses and forbs suggest that amf respond more to plant functional group than plant provenance.
a mitochondria-anchored isoform of the actin-nucleating spire protein regulates mitochondrial division masterminding mitochondrial fission mitochondria are highly dynamic and undergo fusion and fission and they move in cells. defects in mitochondrial dynamics are implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases. recent findings have suggested that mitochondrial fission occurs preferentially at endoplasmic reticulum (er) contact sites, with er circumscribing mitochondria and possibly promoting the constriction of mitochondria during fission. korobova et al. (p. 464) now suggest that an er-localized formin, inf2, is required for mitochondrial fission and that inf2-mediated actin polymerization facilitates mitochondrial constriction. actin filaments between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria promote mitochondrial fission. mitochondrial fission is fundamentally important to cellular physiology. the dynamin-related protein drp1 mediates fission, and interaction between mitochondrion and endoplasmic reticulum (er) enhances fission. however, the mechanism for drp1 recruitment to mitochondria is unclear, although previous results implicate actin involvement. here, we found that actin polymerization through er-localized inverted formin 2 (inf2) was required for efficient mitochondrial fission in mammalian cells. inf2 functioned upstream of drp1. actin filaments appeared to accumulate between mitochondria and inf2-enriched er membranes at constriction sites. thus, inf2-induced actin filaments may drive initial mitochondrial constriction, which allows drp1-driven secondary constriction. because inf2 mutations can lead to charcot-marie-tooth disease, our results provide a potential cellular mechanism for this disease state.
the presence of clustered circulating tumor cells (ctcs) and circulating cytokines define an aggressive phenotype in metastatic colorectal cancer transforming growth factor-β (tgf-β) ligand is a multifunctional growth factor that regulates various cell behavior, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis. because tgf-β is a potent growth inhibitor, abnormalities in tgf-β signaling result in carcinogenesis. in addition to tumor suppressor function, tgf-β acts as an oncogenic factor. in particular, tgf-β signaling plays an important role during metastasis of breast cancer. recently, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (emt) has been shown to confer malignant properties such as cell motility and invasiveness to cancer cells and plays crucial roles during cancer metastasis. moreover, breast stem-like cells exhibit emt properties. because tgf-β is a potent regulator of emt as well as cell stemness, tgf-β signaling might play a crucial role in the regulation of breast cancer stem cells.
ho x observations over west africa during amma: impact of isoprene and no x the measurement of oh reactivity, the inverse of the oh lifetime, provides a powerful tool to investigate atmospheric photochemistry. a new airborne oh reactivity instrument was designed and deployed for the first time on the nasa dc-8 aircraft during the second phase of inter- continental chemical transport experiment-b (intex-b) campaign, which was focused on the asian pollution out- flow over pacific ocean and was based in hawaii and alaska. the oh reactivity was measured by adding oh, generated by photolyzing water vapor with 185 nm uv light in a moveable wand, to the flow of ambient air in a flow tube and mea- suring the oh signal with laser induced fluorescence. as the wand was pulled back away from the oh detector, the oh signal decay was recorded; the slope of 1ln(signal)/1 time was the oh reactivity. the overall absolute uncer- tainty at the 2 confidence levels is about 1 s 1 at low al- titudes (for decay about 6 s 1 ), and 0.7 s 1 at high altitudes (for decay about 2 s 1 ). from the median vertical profile obtained in the second phase of intex-b, the measured oh reactivity (4.0±1.0 s 1 ) is higher than the oh reactiv-
car t cells targeting podoplanin reduce orthotopic glioblastomas in mouse brains the cancer genome atlas network recently cataloged recurrent genomic abnormalities in glioblastoma multiforme (gbm). we describe a robust gene expression-based molecular classification of gbm into proneural, neural, classical, and mesenchymal subtypes and integrate multidimensional genomic data to establish patterns of somatic mutations and dna copy number. aberrations and gene expression of egfr, nf1, and pdgfra/idh1 each define the classical, mesenchymal, and proneural subtypes, respectively. gene signatures of normal brain cell types show a strong relationship between subtypes and different neural lineages. additionally, response to aggressive therapy differs by subtype, with the greatest benefit in the classical subtype and no benefit in the proneural subtype. we provide a framework that unifies transcriptomic and genomic dimensions for gbm molecular stratification with important implications for future studies.
dialog intent structure: a hierarchical schema of linked dialog acts this paper summarizes the latest, final version of iso standard 24617-2 ``semantic annotation framework, part 2: dialogue acts"""". compared to the preliminary version iso dis 24617-2:2010, described in bunt et al. (2010), the final version additionally includes concepts for annotating rhetorical relations between dialogue units, defines a full-blown compositional semantics for the dialogue act markup language diaml (resulting, as a side-effect, in a different treatment of functional dependence relations among dialogue acts and feedback dependence relations); and specifies an optimally transparent xml-based reference format for the representation of diaml annotations, based on the systematic application of the notion of `ideal concrete syntax'. we describe these differences and briefly discuss the design and implementation of an incremental method for dialogue act recognition, which proves the usability of the iso standard for automatic dialogue annotation.
the genetics and neuropathology of alzheimer’s disease a second member of the original family with the valine to isoleucine substitution at codon 717 of the amyloid precursor protein died after the clinical diagnosis of alzheimer's disease had been made in life. neuropathological examination of the brain revealed not only severe alzheimer type pathology, with senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, but also lewy bodies both in the cortex and brainstem. lewy bodies also occurred in our first case, thus showing striking similarities in these two members of the same family. the possibility exists that the occurrence of lewy bodies may not be coincidental, but could be genetically determined: the same genetic abnormality which determines the deposition of beta a4 protein, thus triggering of a chain of events leading to alzheimer's disease, may result in, or predispose to lewy body formation.
identification of leptospiral 3-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydrogenase released in the urine of infected hamsters abstract the current batch potency test for leptospira interrogans serovar canicola vaccines requires the use of a large number of hamsters and has severe effects (i.e., hepatic and renal failure resulting in death); while this vaccine is effective, a safer, cheaper, more ethical replacement is desired. the aim of this study was to analyze vaccine proteomes and identify target molecules common to all l. interrogans serovar canicola vaccines which could be used to design an in vitro potency test. initial analysis of l. interrogans serovar canicola vaccines (a to e) from different manufacturers, using the limulus amebocyte lysate assay and silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels, indicated that lipopolysaccharide was not present in all vaccines, preventing it from being a suitable target molecule. the protein contents of vaccines a to e were therefore determined by two-dimensional liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ([2d-lc/ms] 221 ± 31, 9 ± 8, 34 ± 4, 21 ± 5, and 34 ± 17 proteins [mean ± 1 standard deviation] found, respectively). the outer membrane protein lipl32 was established to be common to all and to be present at a significantly higher (p ≤ 0.05) relative spectral abundance in a batch of vaccine which passed the in vivo potency test than in one which had failed. further analysis using multiple reaction monitoring revealed that the concentration of the n terminus of lipl32 was significantly lower (p ≤ 0.01) in failed batches (n = 2) of vaccine than in passed batches (n = 2); the concentration of the c terminus between the two batches was approximately the same. an in vitro leptospira vaccine potency test, based on n-terminal amino acid quantification of lipl32, was subsequently developed.
reciprocal regulation of microrna-99a and insulin-like growth factor i receptor signaling in oral squamous cell carcinoma cells background: microrna-99a markedly decreases in hcc. results: microrna-99a expression correlates with hcc patients' survival, and microrna-99a restoration suppresses hcc growth in vitro and in vivo by targeting igf-1r and mtor. conclusions: microrna-99a could be prognosis predictor and tumor suppressor for hcc. significance: reveal the important role of microrna-99a in hcc development and provide prognosis predictor and therapeutic approach for hcc. in our in-depth analysis carried out by the illumina solexa massive parallel signature sequencing, microrna-99a (mir-99a) was found to be the sixth abundant microrna in the mirnome of normal human liver but was markedly down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). compelling evidence has suggested the important roles of micrornas in hcc development. however, the biological function of mir-99a deregulation in hcc remains unknown. in this study, we found that mir-99a was remarkably decreased in hcc tissues and cell lines. importantly, lower mir-99a expression in hcc tissues significantly correlated with shorter survival of hcc patients, and mir-99a was identified to be an independent predictor for the prognosis of hcc patients. furthermore, restoration of mir-99a dramatically suppressed hcc cell growth in vitro by inducing the g1 phase cell cycle arrest. intratumoral injection of cholesterol-conjugated mir-99a mimics significantly inhibited tumor growth and reduced the α-fetoprotein level in hcc-bearing nude mice. insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (igf-1r) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) were further characterized as the direct targets of mir-99a. furthermore, protein levels of igf-1r and mtor were found to be inversely correlated with mir-99a expression in hcc tissues. mir-99a mimics inhibited igf-1r and mtor pathways and subsequently suppressed expression of cell cycle-related proteins, including cyclin d1 in hcc cells. conclusively, mir-99a expression was frequently down-regulated in hcc tissues and correlates with the prognosis of hcc patients, thus proposing mir-99a as a prospective prognosis predictor of hcc. mir-99a suppresses hcc growth by inducing cell cycle arrest, suggesting mir-99a as potential tumor suppressor for hcc therapeutics.
optical coherence tomography angiography in retinal vein occlusions purpose this study evaluates the retinal hemodynamics using optical coherence tomography angiography (octa) before and after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) therapy in patients with macular edema associated with retinal vein occlusion (rvo).   methods twelve patients (23 eyes; mean age, 64 years) were included (eight eyes with branch rvo, four with central rvo, and 11 unaffected fellow eyes. the best-corrected visual acuity (bcva) and central retinal thickness (crt) were measured before and 6 months after treatment. the foveal avascular zone (faz), nonperfused areas (npas), and flow area were evaluated with octa before and after treatment.   results the bcva and crt improved significantly after treatment. in eyes with rvo, the baseline faz in the retinal deep capillary layer was larger than in fellow eyes and enlarged in the retinal superficial and deep capillary layers after therapy; npas decreased after therapy, especially in the retinal deep capillary layer; and the baseline flow area was smaller than in fellow eyes and improved after therapy, especially in the retinal deep capillary layer.   conclusions optical coherence tomography angiography can evaluate the retinal hemodynamics in patients with rvos. anti-vegf therapy reduced the npa size and improved retinal blood flow, especially in the retinal deep layer. the current results suggested that anti-vegf therapy might improve retinal deep ischemia in patients with rvo in the retinal deep layer, which is abundant in capillaries.
understanding compliance to privacy guidelines using text-and video-based scenarios studies have repeatedly shown that users are increasingly concerned about their privacy when they go online. in response to both public interest and regulatory pressures, privacy policies have become almost ubiquitous. an estimated 77% of websites now post a privacy policy. these policies differ greatly from site to site, and often address issues that are different from those that users care about. they are in most cases the users' only source of information.this paper evaluates the usability of online privacy policies, as well as the practice of posting them. we analyze 64 current privacy policies, their accessibility, writing, content and evolution over time. we examine how well these policies meet user needs and how they can be improved. we determine that significant changes need to be made to current practice to meet regulatory and usability requirements.
dorsolateral striatum is critical for the expression of surprise‐induced enhancements in cue associability the dorsal striatum plays a key role in the learning and expression of instrumental reward associations that are acquired through direct experience. however, not all learning about instrumental actions require direct experience. instead, humans and other animals are also capable of acquiring instrumental actions by observing the experiences of others. in this study, we investigated the extent to which human dorsal striatum is involved in observational as well as experiential instrumental reward learning. human participants were scanned with fmri while they observed a confederate over a live video performing an instrumental conditioning task to obtain liquid juice rewards. participants also performed a similar instrumental task for their own rewards. using a computational model-based analysis, we found reward prediction errors in the dorsal striatum not only during the experiential learning condition but also during observational learning. these results suggest a key role for the dorsal striatum in learning instrumental associations, even when those associations are acquired purely by observing others.
independent and additive effects of glutamic acid and methionine on yeast longevity we cloned gdh2, the gene that encodes the nad-linked glutamate dehydrogenase in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, by purifying the enzyme, making polyclonal antibodies to it, and using the antibodies to screen a lambda gt11 yeast genomic library. a yeast strain with a deletion-disruption allele of gdh2 which replaced the wild-type gene grew very poorly with glutamate as a nitrogen source, but growth improved significantly when the strain was also provided with adenine or other nitrogenous compounds whose biosynthesis requires glutamine. our results indicate that the nad-linked glutamate dehydrogenase catalyzes the major, but not sole, pathway for generation of ammonia from glutamate. we also isolated yeast mutants that lacked glutamate synthase activity and present evidence which shows that normally nad-linked glutamate dehydrogenase is not involved in glutamate biosynthesis, but that if the enzyme is overexpressed, it may function reversibly in intact cells.
hepatocytes produce tnf-α following hypoxia-reoxygenation and liver ischemia-reperfusion in a nadph oxidase- and c-src-dependent manner. reactive oxygen species are ubiquitous signaling molecules in biological systems. four members of the nadph oxidase (nox) enzyme family are important sources of reactive oxygen species in the vasculature: nox1, nox2, nox4, and nox5. signaling cascades triggered by stresses, hormones, vasoactive agents, and cytokines control the expression and activity of these enzymes and of their regulatory subunits, among which p22phox, p47phox, noxa1, and p67phox are present in blood vessels. vascular nox enzymes are also regulated by rac, clc-3, poldip2, and protein disulfide isomerase. multiple nox subtypes, simultaneously present in different subcellular compartments, produce specific amounts of superoxide, some of which is rapidly converted to hydrogen peroxide. the identity and location of these reactive oxygen species, and of the enzymes that degrade them, determine their downstream signaling pathways. nox enzymes participate in a broad array of cellular functions, including differentiation, fibrosis, growth, proliferation, apoptosis, cytoskeletal regulation, migration, and contraction. they are involved in vascular pathologies such as hypertension, restenosis, inflammation, atherosclerosis, and diabetes. as our understanding of the regulation of these oxidases progresses, so will our ability to alter their functions and associated pathologies.
referential choices in a collaborative storytelling task: discourse stages and referential complexity matter in this study, children, young adults and elderly adults were tested in production and comprehension tasks assessing referential choice. our aims were (1) to determine whether speakers egocentrically base their referential choice on the preceding linguistic discourse or also take into account the perspective of a hypothetical listener and (2) whether the possible impact of perspective taking on referential choice changes with increasing age, with its associated changes in cognitive capacity. in the production task, participants described picture-based stories featuring two characters of the same gender, making it necessary to use unambiguous forms; in the comprehension task, participants interpreted potentially ambiguous pronouns at the end of similar orally presented stories. young adults (aged 18–35) were highly sensitive to the informational needs of hypothetical conversational partners in their production and comprehension of referring expressions. in contrast, children (aged 4–7) did not take into account possible conversational partners and tended to use pronouns for all given referents, leading to the production of ambiguous pronouns that are unrecoverable for a listener. this was mirrored in the outcome of the comprehension task, where children were insensitive to the shift of discourse topic marked by the speaker. the elderly adults (aged 69–87) behaved differently from both young adults and children. they showed a clear sensitivity to the other person's perspective in both production and comprehension, but appeared to lack the necessary cognitive capacities to keep track of the prominence of discourse referents, producing more potentially ambiguous pronouns than young adults, though fewer than children. in conclusion then, referential choice seems to depend on perspective taking in language, which develops with increasing linguistic experience and cognitive capacity, but also on the ability to keep track of the prominence of discourse referents, which is gradually lost with older age.
pet imaging of cholinergic deficits in rats using [18f]fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol ([18f]feobv) background: little is known about alzheimer disease at advanced ages, although its incidence continues to increase at least through the ninth decade of life. objective: to examine the effects of age on the relationship between clinical dementia severity and neuropathologic hallmarks in a large sample spanning the full age range. methods: the authors assessed 81 subjects during life for dementia severity, and examined their brains. they analyzed plaque and tangle burden, as well as the activities of the cholinergic marker enzymes acetylcholinesterase (ache) and choline acetyltransferase (chat), in relation to age at death and the clinical severity of dementia. results: dementia severity was strongly related to plaque and tangle burden in relatively young patients (aged <75 years), but this correlation diminished with age and disappeared in the ninth decade of life. among the oldest patients studied, there was no difference in plaque and tangle load between the mild and severe dementia cases. this interaction (p < 0.0001 for plaque density) was not observed for the cholinergic markers chat and ache. conclusion: the nature or expression of alzheimer disease may be different in severely demented older patients, who have equal cholinergic deficits but significantly lower plaque and tangle burden. if confirmed in a prospective study, these findings have diagnostic and therapeutic implications.
proving bounds on real-valued functions with computations pocklington certificates are known to provide short proofs of primality. we show how to perform this in the framework of formal, mechanically checked, proofs. we present an encoding of certificates for the proof system coq which yields radically improved performances by relying heavily on computations inside and outside of the system (two-level approach).
multi-period classification: learning sequent classes from temporal domains multi-label classification methods are increasingly required by modern applications, such as protein function classification, music categorization, and semantic scene classification. this article introduces the task of multi-label classification, organizes the sparse related literature into a structured presentation and performs comparative experimental results of certain multilabel classification methods. it also contributes the definition of concepts for the quantification of the multi-label nature of a data set.
the association between metabolic abnormality and endometrial cancer: a large case-control study in china. obesity is an independent risk factor for breast cancer, and obese breast cancer patients exhibit a higher risk for larger tumor burden and increased metastasis. obesity, as associated with metabolic syndrome, results in an increase in circulating insulin-like growth factor (igf), which acts as a mitogen. in addition, higher plasma level of adipocytokine leptin is associated with obesity. in the present study, we show that cotreatment with leptin and igf-i significantly increases proliferation as well as invasion and migration of breast cancer cells. we found a novel bidirectional crosstalk between leptin and igf-i signaling; igf-i induced phosphorylation of leptin receptor (ob-rb) and leptin induced phosphorylation of igf-i receptor (igf-ir), whereas cotreatment induced synergistic phosphorylation and association of ob-rb and igf-ir along with activation of downstream effectors, akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. leptin increased phosphorylation of igf signaling molecules insulin-receptor substrate (irs)-1 and irs-2. interestingly, we found that leptin and igf-i cotreatment synergistically transactivated epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr), depending on the proteolytic release of egfr ligands, as the broad-spectrum matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor gm6001 could inhibit this effect. using clinically relevant egfr inhibitors, erlotinib and lapatinib, we found that inhibition of egfr activation effectively inhibited leptin- and igf-i-induced invasion and migration of breast cancer cells. taken together, these data suggest a novel bidirectional crosstalk between leptin and igf-i signaling that transactivates egfr and promotes the metastatic properties as well as invasion and migration of breast cancer cells. our findings indicate the possibility of using egfr inhibitors erlotinib and lapatinib to counter the procancerous effects of leptin and igf-i in breast cancers.
atp hydrolysis provides functions that promote rejection of pairings between different copies of long repeated sequences ideally, self-assembly should rapidly and efficiently produce stable correctly assembled structures. we study the tradeoff between enthalpic and entropic cost in self-assembling systems using reca-mediated homology search as an example. earlier work suggested that reca searches could produce stable final structures with high stringency using a slow testing process that follows an initial rapid search of ∼9-15 bases. in this work, we will show that as a result of entropic and enthalpic barriers, simultaneously testing all ∼9-15 bases as separate individual units results in a longer overall searching time than testing them in groups and stages.
early metazoan divergence was about 830 million years ago previously we suggested that four proteins including aldolase and triose phosphate isomerase (tpi) evolved with approximately constant rates over long periods covering the whole animal phyla. the constant rates of aldolase and tpi evolution were reexamined based on three different models for estimating evolutionary distances. it was shown that the evolutionary rates remain essentially unchanged in comparisons not only between different classes of vertebrates but also between vertebrates and arthropods and even between animals and plants, irrespective of the models used. thus these enzymes might be useful molecular clocks for inferring divergence times of animal phyla. to know the divergence time of parazoa and eumetazoa and that of cephalochordata and vertebrata, the aldolase cdnas from ephydatia fluviatilis, a freshwater sponge, and the tpi cdnas from ephydatia fluviatilis and branchiostoma belcheri, an amphioxus, have been cloned and se-quenced. comparisons of the deduced amino acid sequences of aldolase and tpi from the freshwater sponge with known sequences revealed that the parazoa-eumetazoa split occurred about 940 million years ago (ma) as determined by the average of two proteins and three models. similarly, the aldolase and tpi clocks suggest that vertebrates and amphioxus last shared a common ancestor around 700 ma and they possibly diverged shortly after the divergence of deuterostomes and protostomes.
determinants of preference for lesser-known species among cabinet-makers in oyo and osun states, nigeria olivia has extensive forests. many of these forests have been mined for three species of timber: mahogany (swietenia macrophylla), spanish cedar (cedrela odorata), and south american oak (amburana cearensis). extraction of these timber species has helped the bolivian economy generate foreign exchange and cope with past economic crises. however, the sector is now faced with a new challenge: the forests of boliviaareunable tosupply international markets with traditional species due to previous high levels of extraction. the forestry sector needs to utilize more of the “other” timber species. if products utilizing these species are not developed, bolivia’s forestland will likely be converted to other uses, and the potential for bolivia to remain a major tropical wood producer will be lost.
targeted degradation of pseudo-response regulator5 by an scfztl complex regulates clock function and photomorphogenesis in arabidopsis thaliana[w] in arabidopsis thaliana, the transcripts of the aprr1/toc1 family genes each start accumulating after dawn rhythmically and one after another at intervals in the order of aprr9-->aprr7-->aprr5-->aprr3-->aprr1/toc1 under continuous light. except for the well-characterized aprr1/toc1, however, no evidence has been provided that other aprr1/toc1 family genes are indeed implicated in the mechanisms underlying circadian rhythms. we here attempted to provide such evidence by characterizing transgenic plants that constitutively express the aprr5 gene. the resulting aprr5-overexpressing (aprr5-ox) plants showed intriguing properties with regard to not only circadian rhythms, but also control of flowering time and light response. first, the aberrant expression of aprr5 in such transgenic plants resulted in a characteristic phenotype with regard to transcriptional events, in which free-running rhythms were considerably altered for certain circadian-regulated genes, including cca1, lhy, aprr1/toc1, other aprr1/toc1 members, gi and cab2, although each rhythm was clearly sustained even after plants were transferred to continuous light. with regard to biological events, aprr5-ox plants flowered much earlier than wild-type plants, more or less, in a manner independent of photoperiodicity (or under short-day conditions). furthermore, aprr5-ox plants showed an srl (short-hypocotyls under red light) phenotype that is indicative of hypersensitiveness to red light in early photomorphogenesis. both aprr1-ox and aprr9-ox plants also showed the same phenotype. therefore, aprr5 (together with aprr1/toc1 and aprr9) must be taken into consideration for a better understanding of the molecular links between circadian rhythms, control of flowering time through the photoperiodic long-day pathway, and also light signaling-controlled plant development.
brain’s alpha activity is highly reduced in euthymic bipolar disorder patients recent reports show that the capability of neural networks supporting high-frequency synchronization is reduced in the brain of schizophrenia patients. specifically, deficits in gamma activity have been shown in schizophrenia patients during perception and simple cognitive tasks. however little is known about alterations in gamma responses during complex and higher cognitive processing. the main objective of this study was to investigate modulation of event-related gamma responses in tasks varying working memory (wm) load in schizophrenia patients (n=10) and healthy controls (n=10). gamma amplitude values were obtained for a simple choice reaction task, a low wm demand task, and a high wm demand task. during all three tasks schizophrenia patients showed significantly slower reaction times and higher error rates than controls. a gradual increase of gamma amplitudes after stimulus onset was associated with increase of wm load in controls. in contrast, high amplitude gamma oscillations remained constant regardless of task difficulty in patients. these results suggest that healthy subjects used various cognitive strategies depending on task difficulty, while schizophrenia patients needed to initiate complex cognitive processes similar to those used during processing of novel contexts or stimuli even for the simple choice reaction task with low cognitive demand.
species-specific responses to community density in an unproductive perennial plant community the trophic dynamics of the yukon boreal forest have been under investigation at the kluane lake research station since 1973. we monitored and conducted experiments on the major species in this ecosystem, except the large mammals (for logistic reasons). the central problem has been to determine the causes of the 9 – 10 year cycle of snowshoe hares, and to achieve this we carried out several large-scale experiments manipulating food supplies, predator pressure, and soil nutrient availability to test hypotheses that food, predation, or habitat quality regulate populations. the hare cycle is driven top-down by predators, and most hares die because they are killed by predators. predators also cause stress in female hares, and the stress response seems to be responsible for the loss of reproductive potential in the decline and low phases of the hare cycle. many of the specialist predators and some herbivores in this ecosystem fluctuate with the hare cycle. arctic ground squirrels do, but red squirrels do not, being linked closely to white spruce seed masting years. small rodents fluctuate in numbers in two patterns. red-backed voles and four species of microtus voles have a 3 – 4 year cycle that seems to be driven by food supplies and social behaviour. deer mice, in contrast, have fluctuated dramatically in the 38 years we have monitored them, but not cyclically. white spruce seed production varies with temperature and rainfall, but was not affected by adding nutrients in fertilizer. global warming and reduced hare browsing in the last 20 years have helped to increase the abundance of shrubs in these forests. it will be challenging to predict how this system will change as climatic warming proceeds, because even closely related species in the same trophic level respond differently to perturbations. we recommend continued monitoring of the major species in these boreal forests.
the effect of hydro-alcoholic celery (apiumgraveolens) leaf extract on cardiovascular parameters and lipid profile in animal model of hypertension induced by fructose to determine whether insulin resistance is responsible for the development of hypertension, we examined whether blood pressure changes in an insulin-resistant animal that was given a fructose solution as their drinking water. wistar kyoto rats that drank a 10% fructose solution for 10 weeks showed significant increases not only in plasma triglyceride and insulin levels but also in systolic blood pressure. the decrease in blood glucose in response to the intraperitoneal injection of insulin (0.2-1.0 u/kg) was slight in these fructose-drinking rats. to confirm whether insulin resistance contributes to the observed hypertension, we examined the effect of pioglitazone, an insulin sensitizer, on blood pressure in rats given a 10% fructose solution. when pioglitazone was administered to the rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks from 12 weeks of age, plasma triglyceride and insulin levels and systolic blood pressure decreased, and blood glucose reduction in response to insulin was normalized. these results suggest that insulin resistance is responsible for the development of hypertension in fructose-drinking rats.
markers of lutein and zeaxanthin status in two age groups of men and women: dietary intake, serum concentrations, lipid profile and macular pigment optical density age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in the elderly, is a degenerative condition of the macula characterized by death or dysfunction of the photoreceptors. with the aging population growing, the incidence of age-related macular degeneration is expected to increase. this raises concern about the future of visual dysfunction related falls and the resulting injuries in the elderly population. lutein and zeaxanthin are macular pigments that may play a role in reducing the development and progression of age-related macular degeneration. evidence is accumulating on the consumption of lutein and zeaxanthin (in whole food or supplemental form), the resulting concentrations in the serum, and tissue distribution throughout the body, particularly in the retina. lutein and zeaxanthin intake increases serum concentrations which in turn increases macular pigment density. existing literature focuses on factors affecting macular pigment density, functions of lutein and zeaxanthin as blue-light filters and antioxidants, and risk factors associated with age-related macular degeneration. few studies have focused on the impact of dietary lutein and zeaxanthin on retinal function and the potential to preserve vision and prevent further degeneration. this presents an opportunity for further research to determine an effective dose that delays the progression of age-related macular degeneration.
safety and efficacy of topiramate in neonates with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy treated with hypothermia (neonati) topiramate (tpm) is a structurally novel broad spectrum anticonvulsant known to have a negative modulatory effect on the α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazole propionic acid (ampa)/kainate subtypes of glutamate receptors and some types of voltage‐gated na+ and ca2+ channels, and a positive modulatory effect on some types of γ‐aminobutyric acida (gabaa) receptors and at least one type of k+ channels in neurons. in an earlier work, we showed that the negative modulatory effect of tpm (100 μm) on ampa/kainate receptors in neurons is dependent on tpm modulation of the phosphorylation state of these receptors. in this work, we investigated the effect of tpm on ampa‐induced intracellular calcium ([ca2+]i) responses in cultured rat cortical astrocytes, with special interest in intracellular mechanisms. here, we report that the ability of tpm (1–100 μm) to inhibit ampa‐induced accumulation of ca2+ in astrocytes is inversely related to the level of protein kinase a (pka) ‐mediated phosphorylation of channels activated by ampa. the level of receptor phosphorylation was further determined with western blot using phosphorylation specific antibodies that recognize the glutamate receptor 1 (glur1) subunit phosphorylated on ser845. these results demonstrated that, even in cultured cortical astrocytes, tpm significantly reduced the phophorylation level of glur1 subunits. furthermore, it was shown that tpm binds to ampa receptors in the dephosphorylated state and thereby exerts an allosteric modulatory effect on the ion channel.
optimal study design for pioglitazone in septic pediatric patients growth and development can be investigated using readily observable demographic factors such as weight and age. size is the primary covariate and can be referenced to a 70-kg person with allometry using a coefficient of 0.75 for clearance and 1 for volume. the use of these coefficients is supported by fractal geometric concepts and observations from diverse areas in biology. fat free mass (ffm) might be expected to do better than total body weight when there are wide variations in fat affecting body composition. clearance pathways develop in the fetus before birth. the use of postnatal age as a descriptor of maturation is unsatisfactory because birth may occur prematurely; therefore postmenstrual age is a superior predictor of elimination function. a sigmoid e(max) model (hill equation) describes gradual maturation of clearance in early life leading to a mature adult clearance achieved at a later age.
biodegradation in contaminated aquifers: incorporating microbial/molecular methods. stable isotope fractionation analysis of an aquifer heavily contaminated with benzene (up to 850 mg l(-1)) and toluene (up to 50 mg l(-1)) at a former hydrogenation plant in zeitz (saxonia, germany) has suggested that significant biodegradation of toluene was occurring. however, clear evidence of benzene biodegradation has been lacking at this site. determining the fate of benzene is often a determining factor in regulatory approval of a risk-based management strategy. the objective of the work described here was the demonstration of a new tool that can be used to provide proof of biodegradation of benzene or other organics by indigenous microorganisms under actual aquifer conditions. unique in situ biotraps containing bio-sep beads, amended with 13c-labeled or 12c nonlabeled benzene and toluene, were deployed at the zeitz site for 32 days in an existing groundwater monitoring well and used to collect and enrich microbial biofilms. lipid biomarkers or remaining substrate was extracted from the beads and analyzed by mass spectrometry and molecular methods. isotopic analysis of the remaining amounts of 13c-labeled contaminants (about 15-18% of the initial loading) showed no alteration of the 12c/13c ratio during incubation. therefore, no measurable exchange of labeled compounds in the beads by the nonlabeled compounds in the aquifer materials occurred. isotopic ratio analysis of microbial lipid fatty acids (as methyl ester derivatives) from labeled benzene- and toluene-amended biotraps showed 13c enrichment in several fatty acids of up to delta (13c) 13400%o, clearly verifying benzene and toluene biodegradation and the transformation of the labeled carbon into biomass by indigenous organisms under aquifer conditions. fatty acid profiles of total lipid fatty acids and the phospholipid fatty acid fraction and their isotopic composition showed significant differences between benzene- and toluene-amended biotraps, suggesting that different microbial communities were involved in the biodegradation of the two compounds.
the mind in the machine: anthropomorphism increases trust in an autonomous vehicle anthropomorphism describes the tendency to imbue the real or imagined behavior of nonhuman agents with humanlike characteristics, motivations, intentions, or emotions. although surprisingly common, anthropomorphism is not invariant. this article describes a theory to explain when people are likely to anthropomorphize and when they are not, focused on three psychological determinants--the accessibility and applicability of anthropocentric knowledge (elicited agent knowledge), the motivation to explain and understand the behavior of other agents (effectance motivation), and the desire for social contact and affiliation (sociality motivation). this theory predicts that people are more likely to anthropomorphize when anthropocentric knowledge is accessible and applicable, when motivated to be effective social agents, and when lacking a sense of social connection to other humans. these factors help to explain why anthropomorphism is so variable; organize diverse research; and offer testable predictions about dispositional, situational, developmental, and cultural influences on anthropomorphism. discussion addresses extensions of this theory into the specific psychological processes underlying anthropomorphism, applications of this theory into robotics and human-computer interaction, and the insights offered by this theory into the inverse process of dehumanization.
rheumatologic emergencies background: primary cns vasculitis (pcnsv) is an uncommon disease in which lesions are limited to the brain and spinal cord. our objective was to evaluate the frequency, clinical features, and outcome of spinal cord involvement in pcnsv. methods: we retrospectively identified 101 consecutive patients with pcnsv. spinal cord involvement was documented for five. clinical findings, laboratory studies, and outcomes of patients with spinal cord involvement were assessed and compared with those without spinal cord manifestations. results: spinal cord symptoms developed before cerebral symptoms in one patient, concurrently in two, and after cerebral symptoms in two. cns biopsy specimens showed necrotizing vasculitis in three patients and granulomatous vasculitis in two. mri of the spinal cord showed enhanced thoracic lesions in all five. cerebral angiograms from four patients had normal findings. one patient had a fatal clinical course. the other four had relapses during follow-up but responded well to therapy and had favorable overall outcomes. at the last follow-up (median, 19 months after diagnosis), the four patients had recovered with slight or moderate residual disability. no significant differences in clinical and laboratory features were observed when comparing patients with or without spinal cord involvement. cerebral angiograms with evidence of vasculitis were significantly more frequent for patients without spinal cord involvement (p = 0.002). conclusion: spinal cord involvement was documented in 5% of patients with primary cns vasculitis. the thoracic cord was the predominantly affected site. other than myelopathy, clinical characteristics were similar to those of the patients without spinal cord involvement. glossary: atm = acute transverse myelitis; esr = erythrocyte sedimentation rate; nd = no data; pcnsv = primary cns vasculitis; wbc = white blood cells.
lysis of autologous tumor cells by blood lymphocytes tested at the time of surgery summaryperipheral blood lymphocytes (pbl) of melanoma patients were sensitized in vitro with lymphocytes of a single donor or with a pool of lymphocytes of 5–20 different donors. after 6–7 days, the cytotoxic activity of the sensitized pbl was tested against cultured autologous tumor cells and lymphocytes in a 51cr-release assay. tumor lysis was observed in 13 of 16 cases in which patients' pbl (pt-pbl) were stimulated by a pool of allogeneic lymphocytes and in five out of seven cases when single sensitization was performed. in no case was lysis of autologous normal lymphocytes or blasts seen. cultivation of pt-pbl with irradiated autologous tumor cells never led to the induction of lymphocytes cytotoxic to melanoma cells. lysability by pool-activated autologous pt-pbl of fresh cryopreserved tumor cells was compared to that of short-term cultured tumor cells, and no significant differences were observed. cold-target inhibition experiments indicated that the cytotoxicity of pt-pbl was tumor-restricted since only autologous melanoma cells but not lymphocytes were able to inhibit the reaction. these results indicate that activation of pt-pbl is necessary in order to elicit or amplify their antitumor activity.
gender differences in deception abstract we study a double auction with two-sided private information and preplay communication, for which myerson and satterthwaite (1983, j. econ. theory 28, 265–281) showed that all equilibria are inefficient and the chatterjee–samuleson linear equilibrium is most efficient. like several others, we find that players use communication to surpass equilibrium levels of efficiency, especially when the communication is face-to-face. our main contribution is an analysis of how communication helps the parties achieve such high levels of efficiency. we find that when preplay communication is allowed, efficiency above equilibrium levels is a result of what we call “dyadic” strategies that allow the parties to coordinate on a single price that reflects both parties' valuations. journal of economic literature classification numbers: c78, d82.
ebf factors drive expression of multiple classes of target genes governing neuronal development neuronal specification is often seen as a multistep process: earlier regulators confer broad neuronal identity and are followed by combinatorial codes specifying neuronal properties unique to specific subtypes. however, it is still unclear whether early regulators are re-deployed in subtype-specific combinatorial codes, and whether early patterning events act to restrict the developmental potential of postmitotic cells. here, we use the differential peptidergic fate of two lineage-related peptidergic neurons in the drosophila ventral nerve cord to show how, in a feedforward mechanism, earlier determinants become critical players in later combinatorial codes. amongst the progeny of neuroblast 5–6 are two peptidergic neurons: one expresses fmrfamide and the other one expresses nplp1 and the dopamine receptor dopr. we show the hlh gene collier functions at three different levels to progressively restrict neuronal identity in the 5–6 lineage. at the final step, collier is the critical combinatorial factor that differentiates two partially overlapping combinatorial codes that define fmrfamide versus nplp1/dopr identity. misexpression experiments reveal that both codes can activate neuropeptide gene expression in vast numbers of neurons. despite their partially overlapping composition, we find that the codes are remarkably specific, with each code activating only the proper neuropeptide gene. these results indicate that a limited number of regulators may constitute a potent combinatorial code that dictates unique neuronal cell fate, and that such codes show a surprising disregard for many global instructive cues.
study of camelpox virus pathogenesis in athymic nude mice this study reports the first conclusive evidence of zoonotic camelpox virus (cmlv) infection in humans associated with outbreaks in dromedarian camels (camelus dromedaries) in northwest region of india during 2009. cmlv infection is usually restricted to camels and causes localised skin lesions but occasionally leads to generalised form of disease. however, the present outbreak involved camel handlers and attendants with clinical manifestations such as papules, vesicles, ulceration and finally scabs over fingers and hands. in camels, the pock-like lesions were distributed over the hairless parts of the body. on the basis of clinical and epidemiological features coupled with serological tests and molecular characterization of the causative agent, cmlv zoonosis was confirmed in three human cases. clinical samples such as skin scabs/swabs and blood collected from affected animals and humans were analysed initially, for the presence of cmlv-specific antigen and antibodies by counter immunoelectrophoresis (cie); serum neutralization test (snt); plaque-reduction neutralization test (prnt) and indirect immunoperoxidase test which was later confirmed by amplification of cmlv-specific ankyrin repeat protein (c18l) gene. virus isolation was successful only from samples collected from camels. further, sequence analyses based on three full-length envelope protein genes (a27l, h3l and d8l) revealed 95.2-99.8% and 93.1-99.3% homology with other orthopoxviruses at nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. phylogram of the three genes revealed a close relationship of cmlv with variola virus (varv). considering the emerging and re-emerging nature of the virus, its genetic relatedness to varv, zoonotic potential and productivity losses in camels; the control measures are imperative in curtailing economic and public health impact of the disease. this is the first instance of laboratory confirmed camelpox zoonosis in india.
alternative interventions to prevent oxidative damage following ischemia/reperfusion oxidative stress is considered a major contributor to etiology of both “normal” senescence and severe pathologies with serious public health implications. mitochondria generate reactive oxygen species (ros) that are thought to augment intracellular oxidative stress. mitochondria possess at least nine known sites that are capable of generating superoxide anion, a progenitor ros. mitochondria also possess numerous ros defense systems that are much less studied. studies of the last three decades shed light on many important mechanistic details of mitochondrial ros production, but the bigger picture remains obscure. this review summarizes the current knowledge about major components involved in mitochondrial ros metabolism and factors that regulate ros generation and removal. an integrative, systemic approach is applied to analysis of mitochondrial ros metabolism, which is now dissected into mitochondrial ros production, mitochondrial ros removal, and mitochondrial ros emission. it is suggested that mitochondria augment intracellular oxidative stress due primarily to failure of their ros removal systems, whereas the role of mitochondrial ros emission is yet to be determined and a net increase in mitochondrial ros production in situ remains to be demonstrated.
infection avoidance behavior: viral exposure reduces the motivation to forage in female drosophila melanogaster interactions between immune systems, nervous systems, and behavior are well established in vertebrates. a comparative examination of these interactions in other animals will help us understand their evolution and present adaptive functions. insects show immune-behavioral interactions similar to those seen in vertebrates, suggesting that many of them may have a highly conserved function. activation of an immune response in insects results in illness-induced anorexia, behavioral fever, changes in reproductive behavior, and decreased learning ability in a broad range of species. flight-or-fight behaviors result in a decline in disease resistance. in insects, illness-induced anorexia may enhance immunity. stress-induced immunosuppression is probably due to physiological conflicts between the immune response and those of other physiological processes. because insects occupy a wide range of ecological niches, they will be useful in examining how some immune-behavioral interactions are sculpted by an animal's behavioral ecology.
epidemiology of heart failure in germany: a retrospective database study a broad spectrum of concomitant disorders may complicate heart failure adding further morbidity and mortality risk. comorbidities may be subdivided into cardiovascular and noncardiovascular. the first group includes hypertension, coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, arrhythmias and valvular heart disease. noncardiovascular comorbidities include respiratory, endocrine, metabolic, nutritional, renal, hematopoietic, neurological as well as musculoskeletal conditions. in recent years, advances in the treatment of heart failure have not been attended by important changes in management of its comorbidities. they now seem to be major causes of the poor prognosis of heart failure patients. in this review we provide an updated summary of the epidemiological, pathophysiological and clinical characteristics of comorbidities as well as their potential impact for heart failure treatment.
improved analysis of long-term monitoring data demonstrates marked regional declines of bat populations in the eastern united states white-nose syndrome (wns) is a condition associated with an unprecedented bat mortality event in the northeastern united states. since the winter of 2006*2007, bat declines exceeding 75% have been observed at surveyed hibernacula. affected bats often present with visually striking white fungal growth on their muzzles, ears, and/or wing membranes. direct microscopy and culture analyses demonstrated that the skin of wns-affected bats is colonized by a psychro-philic fungus that is phylogenetically related to geomyces spp. but with a conidial morphology distinct from characterized members of this genus. this report characterizes the cutaneous fungal infection associated with wns.
differential function of the two atg4 homologues in the aggrephagy pathway in caenorhabditis elegans* autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved intracellular catabolic system. during caenorhabditis elegans development, autophagy plays an important role in many physiological processes, including survival under starvation conditions, modulation of life span, and regulation of necrotic cell death caused by toxic ion‐channel variants. recently, it has been demonstrated that during embryogenesis, basal levels of autophagy selectively remove a group of proteins in somatic cells, including the aggregate‐prone components of germline p granules. degradation of these protein aggregates provides a genetic model to identify essential autophagy components and also to elucidate how the autophagic machinery selectively recognizes and degrades specific targets during animal development.
oxidative stress in mouse liver caused by dietary amino acid deprivation: protective effect of methionine two-dimensional non-equilibrium ph gel electrophoresis (2d-nephge) analysis was used to evaluate the effects of dietary protein depletion on the protein composition of mouse liver cytosol. analysing the cytosol from both normal and protein depleted liver, the position in gels of more than three hundred protein spots was determined. after 5 days of protein depletion, about 20% of the spots either increased or decreased more than 2 fold. five spots of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) were recognised by specific antibodies. the glutathione s-transferase (gsts) subunits yb1, yc and yf were identified by the simultaneous analysis of both glutathione-binding cytosolic proteins and the corresponding standards. as estimated by internal optical density (iod) of spots, the changes caused by protein depletion in gapdh and gst subunit contents were similar to those obtained by other methods. by means of mass spectrometric analysis of tryptic peptides generated from spots and/or comparison of two-dimensional gel electrophoretic patterns, carbonic anhydrase iii (caiii), cu, zn superoxide dismutase (cuznsod) and a cytochrome p450 cytosolic protein (cyt p450) were identified. these three proteins, as well as gsts, are related with intracellular detoxification and free radical scavenging systems. their contents were regulated by dietary protein restriction in a manner indicative of diminished liver defence against oxidising agents.
hand function is impaired in healthy older adults at risk of parkinson’s disease in recent studies, we have found a marked increase in substantia nigra (sn) echogenicity in patients with parkinson's disease (pd) using transcranial ultrasound. because a substantial body of evidence has accumulated indicating a selective elevation of iron in the sn from patients with pd, we set out to test the hypothesis that trace metals like iron could lead to the observed increase of sn echogenicity in pd. rat brains were scanned after stereotactic injection of iron in different concentrations into the sn and after injecting ferritin, zinc and 6-ohda alone, and after the addition of desferrioxamine. the amount of iron in the sn was measured spectroscopically. for iron, and partly for 6-ohda, in different concentrations, a dose-dependent increase of sn echogenicity could be visualized, corresponding to an increase of iron measured by spectroscopy. no increase of echogenicity was visualized after the injection of ferritin and the addition of desferrioxamine to 6-ohda, though an increase of iron was measured by spectroscopy. therefore, we conclude that iron not bound to these proteins may lead to an increase of echogenicity of the sn.
marveld2 (dfnb49) mutations in the hearing impaired central european roma population - prevalence, clinical impact and the common origin tight junctions (tjs) are elaborate structures located on the apical region of epithelial cells that limit paracellular permeability. tricellulin is a recently discovered tj protein, which is concentrated at the structurally specialized tricellular tjs but also present at bicellular contacts between epithelial cells, namely in the stomach. interestingly, several tj proteins have been found in other than epithelial cells, as astrocytes, and tricellulin mrna expression was reported in mature dendritic cells. these findings prompted us to look for tricellulin expression in both epithelial and immune cells in the stomach, as well as in microglia, the brain resident immunocompetent cells. immunohistochemical analysis of human stomach tissue sections revealed peroxidase staining at three-corner contact sites, as well as at the contact between two adjacent epithelial cells, thus evidencing the expression of tricellulin not only at tricellullar but at bicellular junctions as well. such analysis, further revealed tricellulin immunostaining in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, scattered throughout the lamina propria. cultured rat microglia exhibited a notorious tricellulin staining, consistent with an extensive expression of the protein along the cell, which was not absolutely coincident with the lysosomal marker cd68. detection of mrna expression by real-time pcr provided supportive evidence for the expression of the tj protein in microglia. these data demonstrate for the first time that microglia express a tj protein. moreover, the expression of tricellulin both in microglia and in the stomach immune cells point to a possible role of this new tj protein in the immune system.
genomics and current genetic understanding of erwinia amylovora and the fire blight antagonist pantoea vagans iron deprivation of erwinia amylovora cfbp1430, a species causing fire blight on pomoïdeae, was shown to induce the production of siderophores of the desferrioxamine (dfo) family and two outer membrane polypeptides with apparent molecular weight of about 70 and 80 kda, respectively. cyclic dfo e was characterized as the major metabolite. phage mudiipr13 insertional mutagenesis and screening on cas-agar medium yielded three dfo non-producing and one overproducing clones. these clones failed to grow in the presence of the fe(iii) chelator eddha and were determined further as dfo and ferrioxamine transport negative mutants, respectively. the transport mutant which appeared to lack the 70 kda polypeptide in the outer membrane allowed the purification of dfo e. growth under iron limitation of dfo negative mutants was stimulated with ferrioxamine e and b but not with other ferrisiderophores tested. the host dna sequence flanking the left terminal part of the mudiipr13 prophage responsible for the transport mutation was cloned and used to probe a parental gene library by dna-dna hybridization. two recombinant cosmids restoring the transport mutation to normal were identified. both cosmids also conferred the ability to utilize ferrioxamine b and e as iron sources on a fhue1 mutant of escherichia coli. this correlated with the production of an additional polypeptide of 70 kda in the outer membrane of e. coli transconjugants, thus confirming that this protein serves the ferrioxamine receptor function (foxr) in e. amylovora.
interaction among genes influencing ethanol metabolism and sex is association with alcohol use disorders in a tibet population twin and adoption studies consistently implicate the importance of genetic influences on alcoholism risk, especially in men. heritability estimates suggest that approximately 50% to 60% of the variability in alcoholism liability is associated with genetic factors. although there has been progress in identifying specific genes that predispose toward alcoholism, we know relatively little about the nature of the genetic influence on alcoholism risk. we also know relatively little about how genetic factors combine with environmental factors to affect alcoholism risk. genotype-environment interaction models posit that alcoholism occurs when individuals both inherit a vulnerability to develop alcoholism and are reared in a provocative environment. such models hold great promise for understanding alcoholism's etiology.
piperlongumine exerts cytotoxic effects against cancer cells with mutant p53 proteins at least in part by restoring the biological functions of the tumor suppressor. this letter is being retracted owing to issues with fig. 1d and supplementary fig. 31b, and the unavailability of original data for these figures that raise concerns regarding the integrity of the figures. nature published two previous corrections related to this letter1,2. these issues in aggregate undermine the confidence in the integrity of this study. authors michael foley, monica schenone, nicola j. tolliday, todd r. golub, steven a. carr, alykhan f. shamji, andrew m. stern and stuart l. schreiber agree with the retraction. authors lakshmi raj, takao ide, aditi u. gurkar, anna mandinova and sam w. lee disagree with the retraction. author xiaoyu li did not respond.
successful nonsurgical treatment of pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, pneumoperitoneum, pneumoretroperitoneum, and subcutaneous emphysema following ercp endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp)-related perforation occurs in 0.1-1.8% of patients after therapeutic ercp. it is a serious complication with a high mortality. however, little evidence exists in the medical literature and the optimal management remains unclear. this review aims to critically evaluate the optimal management of therapeutic ercp-related perforation.
roles for substance p and gastrin-releasing peptide as neurotransmitters released by primary afferent pruriceptors. the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating histamine-independent itch in primary sensory neurons are largely unknown. itch induced by chloroquine (cq) is a common side effect of this widely used antimalarial drug. here, we show that mrgprs, a family of g protein-coupled receptors expressed exclusively in peripheral sensory neurons, function as itch receptors. mice lacking a cluster of mrgpr genes display significant deficits in itch induced by cq but not histamine. cq directly excites sensory neurons in an mrgpr-dependent manner. cq specifically activates mouse mrgpra3 and human mrgprx1. loss- and gain-of-function studies demonstrate that mrgpra3 is required for cq responsiveness in mice. furthermore, mrgpra3-expressing neurons respond to histamine and coexpress gastrin-releasing peptide, a peptide involved in itch sensation, and mrgprc11. activation of these neurons with the mrgprc11-specific agonist bam8-22 induces itch in wild-type but not mutant mice. therefore, mrgprs may provide molecular access to itch-selective neurons and constitute novel targets for itch therapeutics.
screening for body dysmorphic disorder in a dermatology outpatient setting at a tertiary care centre learning objectives: after studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. identify the diagnostic criteria and clinical features of body dysmorphic disorder. 2. describe the prevalence of body dysmorphic disorder in cosmetic populations. 3. identify appropriate treatment strategies for body dysmorphic disorder. background: body dysmorphic disorder is a relatively common psychiatric disorder among persons who seek cosmetic surgical and minimally invasive treatments. methods: this article reviews the history of the diagnosis and the current diagnostic criteria. etiologic theories, clinical and demographic characteristics, and comorbidity, including the relationship of body dysmorphic disorder to obsessive-compulsive spectrum and impulse control disorders, are discussed. the prevalence of body dysmorphic disorder in cosmetic populations is highlighted. treatments for body dysmorphic disorder, including medical, psychiatric, and psychological interventions, are reviewed. results: body dysmorphic disorder is an often severe, impairing disorder. among patients presenting for cosmetic treatments, 7 to 15 percent may suffer from the condition. retrospective outcome studies suggest that persons with body dysmorphic disorder typically do not benefit from cosmetic procedures. pharmacotherapy and cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy, in contrast, appear to be effective treatments for body dysmorphic disorder. conclusions: because of the frequency with which persons with body dysmorphic disorder pursue cosmetic procedures, providers of cosmetic surgical and minimally invasive treatments may be able to identify and refer these patients for appropriate mental health care. directions for future research are suggested.
effects of the exotic invader musculista senhousia on benthic communities of two mediterranean lagoons synopsis. non-indigenous species (nis) are increasingly conspicuous in marine and estuarine habitats throughout the world, as the number, variety, and effects of these species continue to accrue. most of these nis invasions result from anthropogenic dispersal. although the relative importance of different dispersal mechanisms varies both spatially and temporally, the global movement of ballast water by ships appears to be the largest single vector for nis transfer today, and many recent invasions have resulted from this transfer. the rate of new invasions may have increased in recent decades, perhaps due to changes in ballast water transport. estuaries have been especially common sites of invasions, accumulating from tens to hundreds of nis per estuary that include most major taxonomic and trophic groups. we now know of approximately 400 nis along the pacific, atlantic and gulf coasts of the u.s., and hundreds of marine and estuarine nis are reported from other regions of the world. although available information about invasions is limited to a few regions and underestimates the actual number of nis invasions, there are apparent differences in the frequency of nis among sites. mechanisms responsible for observed patterns among sites likely include variation in supply of nis, and perhaps variation in properties of recipient or donor communities, but the role of these mechanisms has not been tested. although our present knowledge about the extent, patterns and mechanisms of marine invasions is still in its infancy, it is clear that nis are a significant force of change in marine and especially estuarine communities globally. taxonomically diverse nis are having significant effects on many, if not most, estuaries that fundamentally alter population, community, and ecosystems processes. the impacts of most nis remain unknown, and the predictability of their direct and indirect effects remains uncertain. nonetheless, based upon the documented extent of nis invasions and scope of then* effects, studies of marine communities that do not include nis are increasingly incomplete.
human gastric cancer organizes neighboring lymphatic vessels via recruitment of bone marrow-derived lymphatic endothelial progenitor cells the extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (ha) is an abundant component of skin and mesenchymal tissues where it facilitates cell migration during wound healing, inflammation, and em- bryonic morphogenesis. both during normal tissue homeostasis and particularly after tissue injury, ha is mobilized from these sites through lymphatic vessels to the lymph nodes where it is degraded before entering the circulation for rapid uptake by the liver. currently, however, the identities of ha binding molecules which control this pathway are unknown. here we describe the first such molecule, lyve-1, which we have identified as a major receptor for ha on the lymph vessel wall. the deduced amino acid sequence of lyve-1 predicts a 322-residue type i integral membrane polypeptide 41% similar to the cd44 ha receptor with a 212-residue extracellular domain containing a single link module the prototypic ha binding domain of the link protein superfamily. like cd44, the lyve-1 molecule binds both soluble and immobilized ha. however, unlike cd44, the lyve-1 molecule colocalizes with ha on the luminal face of the lymph vessel wall and is completely absent from blood vessels. hence, lyve-1 is the first lymph-specific ha receptor to be characterized and is a uniquely powerful marker for lymph vessels themselves.
trans-splenic access for portal venous interventions in children: do benefits outweigh risks? purpose to present methods and results of interventional treatment of children with portal hypertension (ph) secondary to portal vein occlusion (pvo).   material and methods five children, four boys and one girl, 8 - 14 years old, with symptomatic ph secondary to pvo were treated. all children had one or more episodes of bleeding from oesophageal varices, enlarged spleen and thrombocytopenia. partial embolisation of the spleen was performed in four children. attempts to recanalize the occluded part of the portal vein were done in all children using transjugular (n = 4), transhepatic (n = 4) and transsplenic (n = 3) approaches.   results all procedures were carried out without serious complications and were followed by normalisation of the platelet count, decrease in splenic size and disappearance of bleeding. recanalisation of the occluded portal vein with a stent was possible in one child and partial stent recanalisation was possible in another child. transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (tips) with partly extrahepatic, intraperitoneal route was created in one patient. all children were scheduled for follow-up. during the observation time of 22 months (5 - 46 months), additional balloon dilation and placement of new stents were necessary in two children.   conclusion interventional procedures are valuable in the treatment of children with symptoms secondary to pvo. treatment should be customized and scheduled follow-ups of the patients are necessary.
weightedness and structural characterization of hierarchical simple games this book is based on the theory that the economic man attempts to maximize his share of the world's goods and services in the same way that a participant in a game involving many players attempts to maximize his winnings. the authors point out that the maximization of individual wealth is not an ordinary problem in variational calculus, because the individual does not control, and may even be ignorant of, some of the variables. the general theory of social games, in their view, offers a simplified conceptual model of economic behaviour, and a study of that theory can do much to throw light on certain basic concepts of economics, for example, that of utility.theory of games and economic behaviorby john von neumann oskar morgenstern. pp. xviii + 625.

the kisspeptin-gnrh pathway in human reproductive health and disease we report the isolation of a cdna clone named gpr54, which encodes a novel g protein‐coupled receptor (gpcr). a pcr search of rat brain cdna retrieved a clone partially encoding a gpcr. in a library screening this clone was used to isolate a cdna with an open reading frame (orf) encoding a receptor of 396 amino acids long which shared significant identities in the transmembrane regions with rat galanin receptors galr1 (45%), galr3 (45%) and galr2 (44%). northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses revealed that gpr54 is expressed in brain regions (pons, midbrain, thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, cortex, frontal cortex, and striatum) as well as peripheral regions (liver and intestine). in cos cell expression of gpr54 no specific binding was observed for 125i‐galanin. a recent blast search with the rat gpr54 orf nucleotide sequence recovered the human orthologue of gpr54 in a 3.5 mb contig localized to chromosome 19p13.3.
oxidative stress in mouse liver caused by dietary amino acid deprivation: protective effect of methionine two-dimensional non-equilibrium ph gel electrophoresis (2d-nephge) analysis was used to evaluate the effects of dietary protein depletion on the protein composition of mouse liver cytosol. analysing the cytosol from both normal and protein depleted liver, the position in gels of more than three hundred protein spots was determined. after 5 days of protein depletion, about 20% of the spots either increased or decreased more than 2 fold. five spots of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) were recognised by specific antibodies. the glutathione s-transferase (gsts) subunits yb1, yc and yf were identified by the simultaneous analysis of both glutathione-binding cytosolic proteins and the corresponding standards. as estimated by internal optical density (iod) of spots, the changes caused by protein depletion in gapdh and gst subunit contents were similar to those obtained by other methods. by means of mass spectrometric analysis of tryptic peptides generated from spots and/or comparison of two-dimensional gel electrophoretic patterns, carbonic anhydrase iii (caiii), cu, zn superoxide dismutase (cuznsod) and a cytochrome p450 cytosolic protein (cyt p450) were identified. these three proteins, as well as gsts, are related with intracellular detoxification and free radical scavenging systems. their contents were regulated by dietary protein restriction in a manner indicative of diminished liver defence against oxidising agents.
the ethics of community-based research with people who use drugs: results of a scoping review substance-using women who exchange sex for money, drugs or shelter as a means of basic subsistence (ie. survival sex) have remained largely at the periphery of hiv and harm reduction policies and services across canadian cities. this is notwithstanding global evidence of the multiple harms faced by this population, including high rates of violence and poverty, and enhanced vulnerabilities to hiv transmission among women who smoke or inject drugs. in response, a participatory-action research project was developed in partnership with a local sex work agency to examine the hiv-related vulnerabilities, barriers to accessing care, and impact of current prevention and harm reduction strategies among women in survival sex work. this paper provides a brief background of the health and drug-related harms among substance-using women in survival sex work, and outlines the development and methodology of a community-based hiv prevention research project partnership. in doing so, we discuss some of the strengths and challenges of community-based hiv prevention research, as well as some key ethical considerations, in the context of street-level sex work in an urban setting.
a set of regulatory genes co-expressed in embryonic human brain is implicated in disrupted speech development purpose:the goal of this study was to identify new candidate genes and genomic copy-number variations associated with a rare, severe, and persistent speech disorder termed childhood apraxia of speech. childhood apraxia of speech is the speech disorder segregating with a mutation in foxp2 in a multigenerational london pedigree widely studied for its role in the development of speech–language in humans.methods:a total of 24 participants who were suspected to have childhood apraxia of speech were assessed using a comprehensive protocol that samples speech in challenging contexts. all participants met clinical-research criteria for childhood apraxia of speech. array comparative genomic hybridization analyses were completed using a customized 385k nimblegen array (roche nimblegen, madison, wi) with increased coverage of genes and regions previously associated with childhood apraxia of speech.results:a total of 16 copy-number variations with potential consequences for speech–language development were detected in 12 or half of the 24 participants. the copy-number variations occurred on 10 chromosomes, 3 of which had two to four candidate regions. several participants were identified with copy-number variations in two to three regions. in addition, one participant had a heterozygous foxp2 mutation and a copy-number variation on chromosome 2, and one participant had a 16p11.2 microdeletion and copy-number variations on chromosomes 13 and 14.conclusion:findings support the likelihood of heterogeneous genomic pathways associated with childhood apraxia of speech.genet med 2012:14(11):928–936
co-expression of two sugar transporters in primary and lateral roots of etiolated glycine max seedlings* the transporters responsible for sugar uptake into non-photosynthetic sink tissues in plants, such as roots and flowers, have not been fully identified and analyzed. plants encode around 100 putative sugar transporters within the major facilitator superfamily, yet only a few have been studied. here we report the analysis of a sugar alcohol permease homolog (atplt5, at3g18830) from arabidopsis. a wide range of sugars including hexoses, pentoses, tetroses, a sugar acid, and sugar alcohols but not disaccharides induced inward currents in oocytes expressing atplt5. atplt5 expression also resulted in 14c-labeled substrate uptake in oocytes, indicating that atplt5 encodes an ion-coupled uptake transporter. k0.5 values for glucose and sorbitol were highly dependent on external ph. expression of atplt5 was found primarily in sink tissues: in the elongation zone of roots, in the inflorescence stem, and several floral structures, especially in the floral abscission zone. expression was induced by mechanical wounding and insect feeding. analysis of transport properties and expression in arabidopsis indicate that atplt5 functions to transport a wide range of sugars into specific sink tissues in the plant.
ion channel clustering enhances weak electric field detection by neutrophils: apparent roles of skf96365-sensitive cation channels and myeloperoxidase trafficking in cellular responses application of extremely low frequency pulsed dc electric fields that are frequency- and phase-matched with endogenous metabolic oscillations leads to greatly exaggerated neutrophil extension and metabolic resonance wherein oscillatory nad(p)h amplitudes are increased. in the presence of a resonant field, migrating cell length grows from 10 to approximately 40 microm, as does the overall length of microfilament assemblies. in contrast, cells stop locomotion and become spherical when exposed to phase-mismatched fields. although cellular effects were not found to be dependent on electrode type and buffer, they were sensitive to temporal constraints (phase and pulse length) and cell surface charge. we suggest an electromechanical coupling hypothesis wherein applied electric fields and cytoskeletal polymerization forces act together to overcome the surface/cortical tension of neutrophils, thus promoting net cytoskeletal assembly and heightened metabolic amplitudes. metabolic resonance enhances reactive oxygen metabolic production by neutrophils. furthermore, cellular dna damage was observed after prolonged metabolic resonance using both single cell gel electrophoresis ('comet' assay) and 3'-oh dna labeling using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. these results provide insights into transmembrane signal processing and cell interactions with weak electric fields.
economic estimation of the losses caused by surface water pollution accidents in china from the perspective of water bodies’ functions eutrophication has many known consequences, but there are few data on the environmental and health costs. we developed a new framework of cost categories that assess both social and ecological damage costs and policy response costs. these findings indicate the severe effects of nutrient enrichment and eutrophication on many sectors of the economy. we estimate the damage costs of freshwater eutrophication in england and wales to be $105-160 million yr(-1) (pound 75.0-114.3 m). the policy response costs are a measure of how much is being spent to address this damage, and these amount to $77 million yr(-1) pound 54.8 m). the damage costs are dominated by seven items each with costs of $15 million yr(-1) or more: reduced value of waterfront dwellings, drinking water treatment costs for nitrogen removal, reduced recreational and amenity value of water bodies, drinking water treatment costs for removal of algal toxins and decomposition products, reduced value of nonpolluted atmosphere, negative ecological effects on biota, and net economic losses from the tourist industry. in common with other environmental problems, it would represent net value (or cost reduction) if damage was prevented at source. a variety of effective economic, regulatory, and administrative policy instruments are available for internalizing these costs.
let the tree bloom: scalable opportunistic routing with orpl traditionally, routing in wireless sensor networks consists of two steps: first, the routing protocol selects a next hop, and, second, the mac protocol waits for the intended destination to wake up and receive the data. this design makes it difficult to adapt to link dynamics and introduces delays while waiting for the next hop to wake up. in this paper we introduce orw, a practical opportunistic routing scheme for wireless sensor networks. in a duty-cycled setting, packets are addressed to sets of potential receivers and forwarded by the neighbor that wakes up first and successfully receives the packet. this reduces delay and energy consumption by utilizing all neighbors as potential forwarders. furthermore, this increases resilience to wireless link dynamics by exploiting spatial diversity. our results show that orw reduces radio duty-cycles on average by 50% (up to 90% on individual nodes) and delays by 30% to 90% when compared to the state of the art.
evaluation of hydrologically relevant pcm climate variables and large-scale variability over the continental u.s. the land surface parameterization used with the community climate model (ccm3) and the climate system model (csm1), the national center for atmospheric research land surface model (ncar lsm1), has been modified as part of the development of the next version of these climate models. this new model is known as the community land model (clm2). in clm2, the surface is represented by five primary subgrid land cover types (glacier, lake, wetland, urban, vegetated) in each grid cell. the vegetated portion of a grid cell is further divided into patches of up to 4 of 16 plant functional types, each with its own leaf and stem area index and canopy height. the relative area of each subgrid unit, the plant functional type, and leaf area index are obtained from 1-km satellite data. the soil texture dataset allows vertical profiles of sand and clay. most of the physical parameterizations in the model were also updated. major model differences include: 10 layers for soil temperature and soil water with explicit treatment of liquid water and ice; a multilayer snowpack; runoff based on the topmodel concept; new formulation of ground and vegetation fluxes; and vertical root profiles from a global synthesis of ecological studies. simulations with ccm3 show significant improvements in surface air temperature, snow cover, and runoff for clm2 compared to lsm1. clm2 generally warms surface air temperature in all seasons compared to lsm1, reducing or eliminating many cold biases. annual precipitation over land is reduced from 2.35 mm day21 in lsm1 to 2.14 mm day21 in clm2. the hydrologic cycle is also different. transpiration and ground evaporation are reduced. leaves and stems evaporate more intercepted water annually in clm2 than lsm1. global runoff from land increases from 0.75 mm day21 in lsm1 to 0.84 mm day21 in clm2. the annual cycle of runoff is greatly improved in clm2, especially in arctic and boreal regions where the model has low runoff in cold seasons when the soil is frozen and high runoff during the snowmelt season. most of the differences between clm2 and lsm1 are attributed to particular parameterizations rather than to different surface datasets. important processes include: multilayer snow, frozen water, interception, soil water limitation to latent heat, and higher aerodynamic resistances to heat exchange from ground.
predicting domain-domain interaction based on domain profiles with feature selection and support vector machines unlabelled a number of predictive methods have been designed to predict protein interaction from sequence or expression data. on the experimental front, however, high-throughput proteomics technologies are starting to yield large volumes of protein-protein interaction data. high-quality experimental protein interaction maps constitute the natural dataset upon which to build interaction predictions. thus the motivation to develop the first interaction-based protein interaction map prediction algorithm. a technique to predict protein-protein interaction maps across organisms is introduced, the 'interaction-domain pair profile' method. the method uses a high-quality protein interaction map with interaction domain information as input to predict an interaction map in another organism. it combines sequence similarity searches with clustering based on interaction patterns and interaction domain information. we apply this approach to the prediction of an interaction map of escherichia coli from the recently published interaction map of the human gastric pathogen helicobacter pylori. results are compared with predictions of a second inference method based only on full-length protein sequence similarity - the "naive" method. the domain-based method is shown to i) eliminate a significant amount of false-positives of the naive method that are the consequences of multi-domain proteins; ii) increase the sensitivity compared to the naive method by identifying new potential interactions.   availability contact the authors.
multiplanar osteotomy with limited wide margins: a tissue preserving surgical technique for high-grade bone sarcomas background the purpose of this study was to analyze a series of patients with a high-grade metaphyseal osteosarcoma of the knee who had been treated with a transepiphyseal resection, with preservation of the distal femoral and the proximal tibial (articular) portions of the epiphysis, and an intercalary allograft reconstruction.   methods the cases of thirteen patients with a high-grade metaphyseal osteosarcoma around the knee who had transepiphyseal resection and reconstruction with an intercalary allograft were retrospectively reviewed at a mean of sixty-three months. complications, disease-free survival of the patient, final preservation of the limb and epiphysis, and functional results according to the musculoskeletal tumor society scoring system were documented at the time of the latest follow-up.   results at the final follow-up examination, eleven of the thirteen patients continued to be disease-free. one patient died of bone and pulmonary metastases with no evidence of local recurrence, and the remaining patient had no evidence of disease after resection of a local recurrence of the tumor in the soft tissues. no patient had a local recurrence in the remaining epiphysis. seven patients had complications that included a fracture (three patients), diaphyseal nonunion (two), deep infection (one), and a local recurrence in the soft tissues (one). the allograft was removed in only four of these patients. at the latest follow-up examination, twelve patients were alive with preserved limbs. in one patient, the epiphysis, which originally had been preserved, was resected because of a metaphyseal fracture, and the limb was reconstructed with an osteoarticular allograft. the patients with a preserved epiphysis had an average functional score of 27 points (maximum, 30 points).   conclusions preservation of the epiphysis in high-grade metaphyseal osteosarcoma at the knee is an alternative in carefully selected patients. crucial factors needed to obtain local tumor control and achieve an acceptable functional result are a positive response to chemotherapy, accurate preoperative assessment of tumor extension to the epiphysis, and appropriate fixation techniques for intercalary allografts.   level of evidence therapeutic study, level iv (case series [no, or historical, control group]). see instructions to authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.
cd133: a potential indicator for differentiation and prognosis of human cholangiocarcinoma although cd133 has been shown to be a marker for cancer stem cells in various tumours, its expression in pancreatic cancer has not yet been clinically reported. in this study, we investigated the relationship between cd133 expression and clinicopathological factors in pancreatic cancer. pancreatic head carcinoma specimens from 80 patients who underwent surgical resection were immunohistochemically assessed for cd133, vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf)-c, cxcr4, cd34, ki-67, and cytokeratin (ck) expressions. sixty percentage (48/80) of specimens were cd133-positive, with less than 15% cells per specimen expressing the marker. cd133-positive cells were found at the peripheral site of adenocarcinoma glandular structures and were negative for ck. there was a significant correlation between cd133 expression and clinicopathological factors, including histological type, lymphatic invasion, and lymph node metastasis (p=0.0215, 0.0023, and 0.0024, respectively). vascular endothelial growth factor-c expression was also significantly correlated with cd133 expression (p=0.0002). consequently, the 5-year survival rate of cd133-positive patients was significantly lower than that of cd133-negative patients (p=0.0002) and multivariate analysis revealed that cd133 expression was an independent prognostic factor (p=0.0103). these results suggest that cd133 expression in pancreatic cancer was significantly associated with lymphatic metastasis, vegf-c expression, and prognosis.
segregation of seizure traits in c57 black mouse substrains using the repeated-flurothyl model myoclonus is often observed in epilepsy. it is characterized by sudden involuntary shock-like movements of the body (myoclonic jerks, mjs). this study examined whether epileptic myoclonus was under genetic control. inbred strains of mice were administered eight daily flurothyl exposures, a 28-day rest period, and a final flurothyl retest. for all trials, the latency to the first mj (threshold) and the number of mjs (mj#) were recorded. the inbred strains that we examined exhibited significant variability in initial myoclonic response, and myoclonus across the eight flurothyl exposures. c57bl/6j and dba/2j mice displayed significantly different initial latencies to a mj, mj# preceding a generalized seizure (gs), and changes in mj threshold and mj# across the eight seizure trials. [c57bl/6j x dba/2j] f1-hybrid mice showed an initial mj threshold and decreases in mj threshold over the eight trials, which were similar to c57bl/6j; however, f1-hybrids had an initial mj# and trend in mj# over the eight trials that were similar to dba/2j. decreases in mj threshold and mj# following multiple seizure trials, observed in c57bl/6j mice, were dependent on the expression of gss and not on mj occurrence. our study is the first to document the potential for genetic heterogeneity of myoclonus in mice; we show that significant alterations in myoclonic behavior occur after gss. these results indicate that multiple gss affect mj thresholds. an understanding of the genetics of myoclonus will be important for determination of the brain areas responsible for myoclonus as well as for identification of candidate genes.
proline-rich cell wall proteins accumulate in growing regions and phloem tissue in response to water deficit in common bean seedlings two antigenically related glycoproteins, called p33 and p36, accumulate in the soluble fraction of the cell wall in response to water deficit in phaseolus vulgaris. in this report, we show that p33 and p36 are able to adhere to leaf protoplasts, and that they bind to plasma membrane (pm) vesicles in a divalent cation-dependent manner. data from the partial amino acid sequence of the p33 and p36 proteins indicate that they contain repeats of the decapeptide povykpovek; therefore, they are related to proline-rich proteins. binding assays demonstrate that both proteins specifically bind to an 80 kda pm protein. this binding is competed with a peptide that contains the rgd motif, as well as with fibronectin, which also includes this sequence, suggesting that the 80 kda pm protein has an integrin-like function whose natural ligands are p33 and p36. this is the first case where a pm ligand for a higher plant cell wall protein has been identified.
enabling protocol-based medical critiquing we present a methodology and tool for providing retrospective review and critiquing of guideline-based medical care given to patients. we show how our guideline representation language, asbru, which supports the use of physicians intentions in addition to physician's actions, allows us to compare the care given to a patient at the level of the intention to treat in addition to the more detailed plan carried out. we have developed an algorithm based on this representation for retrospective quality assessment of guideline-based care. our method takes the physician's and institution's preferences and policies into account in explaining or justifying physician deviations from the recommendations of a guideline.
müllerian adenosarcoma of the uterus with heterologous elements: two case reports and literature review background total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is generally considered optimal therapy for patients with uterine sarcomas. local resection of the tumor or hysterectomy with ovarian conservation has been used in only a small number of patients. recurrence risk in women undergoing ovarian-sparing surgery for müllerian adenosarcomas can be difficult to evaluate due to the paucity of literature in this area. we present a reproductive-age woman with a müllerian adenosarcoma and review the literature on conservative surgical management of this class of tumors.   case a 25-year-old nulligravida was diagnosed with a uterine adenosarcoma and the question of conservative surgical therapy arose. following a literature review, discussion with the patient led to the decision for ovarian preservation at the time of hysterectomy. the pelvis and abdomen were grossly free of metastatic disease at laparotomy and all tumor was confined to the uterus on pathologic examination. she is free of disease 36 months postoperatively and is now considering in vitro fertilization using a surrogate.   conclusion ovarian conservation can probably be offered safely in carefully selected women of reproductive age with müllerian adenosarcomas.
the ethics of community-based research with people who use drugs: results of a scoping review substance-using women who exchange sex for money, drugs or shelter as a means of basic subsistence (ie. survival sex) have remained largely at the periphery of hiv and harm reduction policies and services across canadian cities. this is notwithstanding global evidence of the multiple harms faced by this population, including high rates of violence and poverty, and enhanced vulnerabilities to hiv transmission among women who smoke or inject drugs. in response, a participatory-action research project was developed in partnership with a local sex work agency to examine the hiv-related vulnerabilities, barriers to accessing care, and impact of current prevention and harm reduction strategies among women in survival sex work. this paper provides a brief background of the health and drug-related harms among substance-using women in survival sex work, and outlines the development and methodology of a community-based hiv prevention research project partnership. in doing so, we discuss some of the strengths and challenges of community-based hiv prevention research, as well as some key ethical considerations, in the context of street-level sex work in an urban setting.
biomarkers for melanoma diagnosis and the technologies used to identify them during the past several decades, there has been a substantial increase in the incidence of cutaneous melanoma among all caucasian populations. the number of deaths due to cutaneous malignant melanoma has also increased in most fair‐skinned populations throughout the world in the past few decades. trends in melanoma incidence worldwide are examined. the most recent data on the mortality from cutaneous melanoma are reported. the role of different environmental, genetic and host factors in the aetiology of melanoma is discussed.
acute enhancement of insulin secretion by ffa in humans is lost with prolonged ffa elevation. in the fasted rat, efficient glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (gsis) is absolutely dependent on an elevated level of circulating free fatty acids (ffas). to determine if this is also true in humans, nonobese volunteers were fasted for 24 h (n = 5) or 48 h (n = 5), after which they received an infusion of either saline or nicotinic acid (na) to deplete their plasma ffa pool, followed by an intravenous bolus of glucose. na treatment resulted in a fall in basal insulin concentrations of 35 and 45% and in the area under the insulin response curve (area under the curve [auc]) to glucose of 47 and 42% in the 24- and 48-h fasted individuals, respectively. the 48-h fasted subjects underwent the same procedure with the addition of a coinfusion of intralipid plus heparin (together with na) to maintain a high concentration of plasma ffas throughout the study. the basal level and auc for insulin were now completely normalized (c-peptide profiles paralleled those for insulin). to assess the effect of an overnight fast, nonobese (n = 6) and obese (n = 6) subjects received an infusion of either saline or na, followed by a hyperglycemic clamp (200 mg/dl). the insulin auc in response to glucose was unaffected by lowering of the ffa level in nonobese subjects, but fell by 29% in the obese group. the data clearly demonstrate that in humans, the rise in circulating ffa levels after 24 and 48 h of food deprivation is critically important for pancreatic beta-cell function both basally and during subsequent glucose loading. they also suggest that the enhancement of gsis by ffas in obese individuals is more prominent than that seen in their nonobese counterparts.
disease resistance in the drywood termite, incisitermes schwarzi: does nesting ecology affect immunocompetence? abstract the benefit of sociality in relation to disease susceptibility was studied in the dampwood termite zootermopsis angusticollis. although contact with high concentrations of fungal conidia is lethal, the survivorship of nymphs exposed to spore suspensions ranging from 6 × 106 to 2 × 108 spores/ml of the fungus metarhizium anisopliae increased with group size. the survivorship (measured as lt50) of isolated individuals ranged from 3.0 to 4.8 days, but infected nymphs living in groups of 10 and 25 individuals survived significantly longer (5.6–8.3 and 5.6–9.1 days, respectively). in most cases, there were no significant differences in the survival distributions of the 10- and 25-termite groups. when nymphs were infected with concentrations of 7 × 101–7 × 104 spores/ml and allowed to interact with healthy nestmates, fungal infections were not contracted by the unexposed termites. moreover, infected termites benefitted from social contact with unexposed nestmates: their survival rates were significantly higher than those of infected termites living with similarly infected nestmates. allogrooming, which increased in frequency during and after exposure to conidia, appeared to remove potentially infectious spores from the cuticle, thus increasing termite survivorship. these results suggest that allogrooming plays a crucial role in the control of disease and its death hazard in termites. the infection-reducing advantage of group living may have been significant in the evolution of social behavior in the isoptera.
a prospective study of aromatase inhibitor therapy, vitamin d, c-reactive protein and musculoskeletal symptoms the rate of musculoskeletal pain in adolescent and adult populations is examined, with a focus on three commonly reported pain disorders: shoulder pain, low back pain and fibromyalgia/chronic widespread pain. there is a paucity of data on musculoskeletal pain in adolescent populations. those studies available suggest that pain is common, although the actual rates are unclear. this is probably due to differences in study methodologies and populations. pain is commonly reported among adult populations, with almost one fifth reporting widespread pain, one third shoulder pain, and up to one half reporting low back pain in a 1-month period. the prevalence of pain varies within specific population subgroups; group factors (including socioeconomic status, ethnicity and race) and individual factors (smoking, diet, and psychological status) are all associated with the reporting of musculoskeletal pain. however, the precise nature of these relationships, and particularly the mechanisms of association, are unclear and require further investigation.
anaplastology in times of facial transplantation: still a reasonable treatment option? the reconstruction of hard and soft tissue defects, mainly after ablative oncologic surgery in the head and neck area, is an evolving field. the use of free flaps for reconstruction of the head and neck is considered to be the surgical standard. in our analysis of more than 1000 free flaps we give an overview of the development of the use of different types of free tissue transfer to the head and neck area over the last 25 years. we show that the evolving field of head and neck reconstruction raises new possibilities with new types of flaps, whereas other types of flaps disappear in the everyday clinical use. the spectrum of reconstruction possibilities broadens with the number of different flap types available to the head and neck surgeon.
dialog intent structure: a hierarchical schema of linked dialog acts this paper summarizes the latest, final version of iso standard 24617-2 ``semantic annotation framework, part 2: dialogue acts"""". compared to the preliminary version iso dis 24617-2:2010, described in bunt et al. (2010), the final version additionally includes concepts for annotating rhetorical relations between dialogue units, defines a full-blown compositional semantics for the dialogue act markup language diaml (resulting, as a side-effect, in a different treatment of functional dependence relations among dialogue acts and feedback dependence relations); and specifies an optimally transparent xml-based reference format for the representation of diaml annotations, based on the systematic application of the notion of `ideal concrete syntax'. we describe these differences and briefly discuss the design and implementation of an incremental method for dialogue act recognition, which proves the usability of the iso standard for automatic dialogue annotation.
strategies for mining fungal natural products loss-of-function aspergillus nidulans ccla, a bre2 ortholog involved in histone h3 lysine 4 methylation, activated the expression of cryptic secondary metabolite clusters in a. nidulans. one new cluster generated monodictyphenone, emodin and emodin derivatives, whereas a second encoded two anti-osteoporosis polyketides, f9775a and f9775b. modification of the chromatin landscape in fungal secondary metabolite clusters allows for a simple technological means to express silent fungal secondary metabolite gene clusters.
features of the retinotopic representation in the visual wulst of a laterally eyed bird, the zebra finch (taeniopygia guttata) visual wulst responses to ipsi- and contralateral visual stimuli were investigated in young zebra finches (taeniopygia guttata castanotis gould) of different ages. contralateral responses in 20, 40, 60 and 80 day old birds do not differ significantly from those in adults. in contrast, ipsilateral responses decrease substantially during development and become very weak and irregular in adult birds.
embryoid body formation of human amniotic fluid stem cells depends on mtor the target of rapamycin (tor) is a conserved ser/thr kinase that regulates cell growth and metabolism in response to environmental cues. here, highlighting contributions from studies in model organisms, we review mammalian tor complexes and the signaling branches they mediate. tor is part of two distinct multiprotein complexes, tor complex 1 (torc1), which is sensitive to rapamycin, and torc2, which is not. the physiological consequences of mammalian torc1 dysregulation suggest that inhibitors of mammalian tor may be useful in the treatment of cancer, cardiovascular disease, autoimmunity, and metabolic disorders.
cell cycle activation and spinal cord injury amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) is characterized by progressive degeneration of the motor neurons in the cerebral cortex, brain stem, and spinal cord. however, the mechanisms that regulate the initiation and/or progression of motor neuron loss in this disease remain enigmatic. cell-cycle proteins and transcriptional regulators such as cyclins, cyclin-associated kinases, the retinoblastoma gene product (prb), and e2f-1 function during cellular proliferation, differentiation, and cell death pathways. recent data has implicated increased expression and activation of various cell-cycle proteins in neuronal cell death. we have examined the expression and subcellular distribution of g(1) to s phase cell-cycle regulators in the spinal cord, motor cortex, and sensory cortex from clinically and neuropathologically diagnosed sporadic als cases and age-matched controls. our results indicate hyperphosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein in motor neurons during als, concurrent with increased levels of cyclin d, and redistribution of e2f-1 into the cytoplasm of motor neurons and glia. these data suggest that g(1) to s phase activation occurs during als and may participate in molecular mechanisms regulating motor neuron death.
enhancing masculinity by slandering homosexuals two experiments tested whether the relation between automatic prejudice and discriminatory behavior is moderated by 2 conscious processes: conscious egalitarian beliefs and behavioral control. the authors predicted that, when both conscious processes are deactivated, automatic prejudice would elicit discriminatory behavior. when either of the 2 processes is activated, behavioral bias would be eliminated. the authors assessed participants' automatic attitudes toward gay men, conscious beliefs about gender, behavioral control, and interactions with gay confederates. in experiment 1, men's beliefs about gender were heterogeneous, whereas women's beliefs were mostly egalitarian; men's responses supported the predictions, but women's responses did not. in experiment 2, the authors recruited a sample with greater diversity in gender-related beliefs. results showed that, for both sexes, automatic prejudice produced biased behavior in the absence of conscious egalitarian beliefs and behavioral control. the presence of either conscious process eliminated behavioral bias.
experimental subjects and partial truth telling during technological change in radiotherapy gillon discusses the conflicting moral implications of the principles of respect for autonomy and of beneficence and non-maleficence when telling patients the truth about their illnesses and treatments. the case for nondisclosure is usually based on three major arguments: that doctors' hippocratic obligations to benefit and not harm their patients take precedence over not deceiving them; that the range of possible conditions and prognoses makes it difficult for physicians to know the full truth or for patients to comprehend it; and that patients do not wish to be told dire news. gillon rejects each of these arguments, contending that avoiding deceit is a basic moral norm that can be defended from utilitarian as well as deontological points of view. with regard to the argument concerning patient attitudes, he recommends that pilot studies be done, asking patients what their preferences are at the time they register with a doctor or hospital.
rhob is associated with the anti-angiogenic effects of celiac patient transglutaminase 2-targeted autoantibodies coeliac disease is characterized by immunoglobulin‐a (iga)‐class autoantibodies targeted against transglutaminase 2 (tg2), a multi‐functional protein also with a role in angiogenesis. these antibodies are present in patient serum but are also found bound to tg2 below the epithelial basement membrane and around capillaries in the small intestinal mucosa. based on these facts and the information that the mucosal vasculature of coeliac patients on a gluten‐containing diet is disorganized, we studied whether the coeliac disease‐specific autoantibodies targeted against tg2 would disturb angiogenesis. the effects of coeliac disease‐specific autoantibodies on in vitro angiogenesis were studied in angiogenic cell cultures. the binding of the antibodies to cells, endothelial sprouting, migration of both endothelial and vascular mesenchymal cells, the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton in both cell types and the differentiation of vascular mesenchymal cells were recorded. in vitro, iga derived from coeliac disease patients on a gluten‐containing diet binds to surface tg2 on endothelial and vascular mesenchymal cells and this binding can be inhibited by the removal of tg2. in addition, coeliac disease‐specific autoantibodies targeting tg2 disturb several steps of angiogenesis: endothelial sprouting and the migration of both endothelial and vascular mesenchymal cells. furthermore, the autoantibodies cause disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in both capillary cell types that account most probably for the defective cellular migration. we conclude that coeliac disease‐specific autoantibodies recognizing tg2 inhibit angiogenesis in vitro. this disturbance of the angiogenic process could lead in vivo to the disruption of the mucosal vasculature seen in coeliac disease patients on a gluten‐containing diet.
investigation of sporulation in the desulfotomaculum genus: a genomic comparison with the genera bacillus and clostridium. spore formation by bacillus subtilis takes place in a sporangium consisting of two chambers, the forespore and the mother cell, which are linked by pathways of intercellular communication. one pathway, which couples the activation of the forespore transcription factor sigma(g) to the action of sigma(e) in the mother cell, has remained mysterious. traditional models hold that sigma(e) initiates a signal transduction pathway that specifically activates sigma(g) in the forespore. recent experiments indicating that the mother cell and forespore are joined by a channel have led to the suggestion that a specific regulator of sigma(g) is transported from the mother cell into the forespore. as we report here, however, the requirement for the channel is not limited to sigma(g). rather, it is also required for the persistent activity of the early-acting forespore transcription factor sigma(f) as well as that of a heterologous rna polymerase (that of phage t7). we infer that macromolecular synthesis in the forespore becomes dependent on the channel at intermediate stages of development. we propose that the channel is a gap junction-like feeding tube through which the mother cell nurtures the developing spore by providing small molecules needed for biosynthetic activity, including sigma(g)-directed gene activation.
haploreg: a resource for exploring chromatin states, conservation, and regulatory motif alterations within sets of genetically linked variants pharmacogenomics has employed candidate gene studies and, more recently, genome-wide association studies (gwas) in efforts to identify loci associated with drug response and/or toxicity. the advantage of gwas is the simultaneous, unbiased testing of millions of snps; the challenge is that functional information is absent for the vast majority of loci that are implicated. in the present study, we systematically evaluated snps associated with chemotherapeutic agent–induced cytotoxicity for six different anticancer agents and evaluated whether these snps were disproportionately likely to be within a functional class such as coding (consisting of missense, nonsense, or frameshift polymorphisms), noncoding (such as 3′utrs or splice sites), or expression quantitative trait loci (eqtls; indicating that a snp genotype is associated with the transcript abundance level of a gene). we found that the chemotherapeutic drug susceptibility–associated snps are more likely to be eqtls, and, in fact, more likely to be associated with the transcriptional expression level of multiple genes (n ≥ 10) as potential master regulators, than a random set of snps in the genome, conditional on minor allele frequency. furthermore, we observed that this enrichment compared with random expectation is not present for other traditionally important coding and noncoding snp functional categories. this research therefore has significant implications as a general approach for the identification of genetic predictors of drug response and provides important insights into the likely function of snps identified in gwas analysis of pharmacologic studies.
de novo cloning and annotation of genes associated with immunity, detoxification and energy metabolism from the fat body of the oriental fruit fly, bactrocera dorsalis tsetse flies (diptera: glossinidia) are vectors of pathogenic african trypanosomes. to develop a foundation for tsetse physiology, a normalized expressed sequence tag (est) library was constructed from fat body tissue of immune‐stimulated glossina morsitans morsitans. analysis of 20 257 high‐quality ests yielded 6372 unique genes comprised of 3059 tentative consensus (tc) sequences and 3313 singletons (available at http://aksoylab.yale.edu). we analysed the putative fat body transcriptome based on homology to other gene products with known functions available in the public domain. in particular, we describe the immune‐related products, reproductive function related yolk proteins and milk‐gland protein, iron metabolism regulating ferritins and transferrin, and tsetse's major energy source proline biosynthesis. expression analysis of the three yolk proteins indicates that all are detected in females, while only the yolk protein with similarity to lipases, is expressed in males. milk gland protein, apparently important for larval nutrition, however, is primarily synthesized by accessory milk gland tissue.
the combination of mln2238 (ixazomib) with interferon-alpha results in enhanced cell death in melanoma purpose: the success of bortezomib therapy for treatment of multiple myeloma (mm) led to the development of structurally and pharmacologically distinct novel proteasome inhibitors. in the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of one such novel orally bioactive proteasome inhibitor mln9708/mln2238 in mm using well-established in vitro and in vivo models. experimental design: mm cell lines, primary patient cells, and the human mm xenograft animal model were used to study the antitumor activity of mn2238. results: treatment of mm cells with mln2238 predominantly inhibits chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome and induces accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. mln2238 inhibits growth and induces apoptosis in mm cells resistant to conventional and bortezomib therapies without affecting the viability of normal cells. in animal tumor model studies, mln2238 is well tolerated and inhibits tumor growth with significantly reduced tumor recurrence. a head-to-head analysis of mln2238 versus bortezomib showed a significantly longer survival time in mice treated with mln2238 than mice receiving bortezomib. immununostaining of mm tumors from mln2238-treated mice showed growth inhibition, apoptosis, and a decrease in associated angiogenesis. mechanistic studies showed that mln2238-triggered apoptosis is associated with activation of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9; increase in p53, p21, noxa, puma, and e2f; induction of endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress response proteins bip, phospho-eif2-α, and chop; and inhibition of nuclear factor kappa b. finally, combining mln2238 with lenalidomide, histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, or dexamethasone triggers synergistic anti-mm activity. conclusion: our preclinical study supports clinical evaluation of mln9708, alone or in combination, as a potential mm therapy. clin cancer res; 17(16); 5311–21. ©2011 aacr.
plant-produced asialo-erythropoietin restores pancreatic beta-cell function by suppressing mammalian sterile-20-like kinase (mst1) and caspase-3 activation manipulation of the hippo signaling pathway with a reversible and selective small-molecule inhibitor of hippo kinase mst1/2 provides a therapeutic option for tissue injury and repair. drug-induced regeneration popping a pill to repair an organ may eventually become reality. turning away from conventional scaffolds, materials, and cell-based regenerative medicine strategies, fan and colleagues sought a small molecule that could specifically target a critical signaling molecule in the hippo pathway. loss of kinases in this pathway, mst1/2, increases cell proliferation during development; thus, the authors hypothesized that inhibiting their activity in mature organs could help repair any damage. they discovered a drug, xmu-mp-1, that blocked mst1/2 activity and found that it promoted liver repair and regeneration in four different mouse models of acute and chronic injuries, including acetaminophen-induced injury, which is a common cause of liver failure worldwide. such a pharmacological strategy could make tissue regeneration easier for many, compared to complex biomaterial and cell therapies. tissue repair and regenerative medicine address the important medical needs to replace damaged tissue with functional tissue. most regenerative medicine strategies have focused on delivering biomaterials and cells, yet there is the untapped potential for drug-induced regeneration with good specificity and safety profiles. the hippo pathway is a key regulator of organ size and regeneration by inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis. kinases mst1 and mst2 (mst1/2), the mammalian hippo orthologs, are central components of this pathway and are, therefore, strong target candidates for pharmacologically induced tissue regeneration. we report the discovery of a reversible and selective mst1/2 inhibitor, 4-((5,10-dimethyl-6-oxo-6,10-dihydro-5h-pyrimido[5,4-b]thieno[3,2-e][1,4]diazepin-2-yl)amino)benzenesulfonamide (xmu-mp-1), using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay–based high-throughput biochemical assay. the cocrystal structure and the structure-activity relationship confirmed that xmu-mp-1 is on-target to mst1/2. xmu-mp-1 blocked mst1/2 kinase activities, thereby activating the downstream effector yes-associated protein and promoting cell growth. xmu-mp-1 displayed excellent in vivo pharmacokinetics and was able to augment mouse intestinal repair, as well as liver repair and regeneration, in both acute and chronic liver injury mouse models at a dose of 1 to 3 mg/kg via intraperitoneal injection. xmu-mp-1 treatment exhibited substantially greater repopulation rate of human hepatocytes in the fah-deficient mouse model than in the vehicle-treated control, indicating that xmu-mp-1 treatment might facilitate human liver regeneration. thus, the pharmacological modulation of mst1/2 kinase activities provides a novel approach to potentiate tissue repair and regeneration, with xmu-mp-1 as the first lead for the development of targeted regenerative therapeutics.
the effect of dietary fat intake on hepatic gene expression in lg/j and sm/j mice objective to examine the differential response of obesity- and diabetes-related traits to a high- or low-fat diet in lg/j and sm/j mice. we also examined food consumption in these strains.   research methods and procedures mice were placed on a high- or low-fat diet after weaning. animals were weighed once per week and subjected to glucose tolerance tests at 20 weeks. at sacrifice, fat pads and internal organs were removed along with serum samples. for food consumption, lg/j and sm/j mice of each sex were assigned to a high-fat or low-fat diet after reaching maturity. mice were weighed three times per week, and food consumed was determined by subtraction.   results lg/j animals consume more total food, but sm/j animals consume more food per gram of body weight. lg/j mice grow faster to 10 weeks but slower from 10 to 20 weeks, have higher cholesterol and free fatty acid levels, and have lower basal glucose levels and better response to a glucose challenge than sm/j mice. for most traits, sm/j mice respond more strongly to a high-fat diet than lg/j mice, including body weight and growth, basal glucose levels, organ weights, fat distribution, and circulating triglycerides and cholesterol levels.   discussion obesity-related phenotypes, as well as response to increased dietary fat, differ genetically between lg/j and sm/j and can, therefore, be mapped. this study indicates that the cross of sm/j and lg/j mice would be an excellent model system for the study of gene-by-diet interaction in obesity.
protoporphyrin ix regulates peripheral benzodiazepine receptor associated protein 7 (pap7) and divalent metal transporter 1 (dmt1) in k562 cells the movement of anionic porphyrins (for example, haem) across intracellular membranes is crucial to many biological processes, but their mitochondrial translocation and coordination with haem biosynthesis is not understood. transport of porphyrins into isolated mitochondria is energy-dependent, as expected for the movement of anions into a negatively charged environment. atp-binding cassette transporters actively facilitate the transmembrane movement of substances. we found that the mitochondrial atp-binding cassette transporter abcb6 is upregulated (messenger rna and protein in human and mouse cells) by elevation of cellular porphyrins and postulated that abcb6 has a function in porphyrin transport. we also predicted that abcb6 is functionally linked to haem biosynthesis, because its mrna is found in both human bone marrow and cd71+ early erythroid cells (by database searching), and because our results show that abcb6 is highly expressed in human fetal liver, and abcb6 in mouse embryonic liver. here we demonstrate that abcb6 is uniquely located in the outer mitochondrial membrane and is required for mitochondrial porphyrin uptake. after abcb6 is upregulated in response to increased intracellular porphyrin, mitochondrial porphyrin uptake activates de novo porphyrin biosynthesis. this process is blocked when the abcb6 gene is silenced. our results challenge previous assumptions about the intracellular movement of porphyrins and the factors controlling haem biosynthesis.
pet imaging of cholinergic deficits in rats using [18f]fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol ([18f]feobv) background: little is known about alzheimer disease at advanced ages, although its incidence continues to increase at least through the ninth decade of life. objective: to examine the effects of age on the relationship between clinical dementia severity and neuropathologic hallmarks in a large sample spanning the full age range. methods: the authors assessed 81 subjects during life for dementia severity, and examined their brains. they analyzed plaque and tangle burden, as well as the activities of the cholinergic marker enzymes acetylcholinesterase (ache) and choline acetyltransferase (chat), in relation to age at death and the clinical severity of dementia. results: dementia severity was strongly related to plaque and tangle burden in relatively young patients (aged <75 years), but this correlation diminished with age and disappeared in the ninth decade of life. among the oldest patients studied, there was no difference in plaque and tangle load between the mild and severe dementia cases. this interaction (p < 0.0001 for plaque density) was not observed for the cholinergic markers chat and ache. conclusion: the nature or expression of alzheimer disease may be different in severely demented older patients, who have equal cholinergic deficits but significantly lower plaque and tangle burden. if confirmed in a prospective study, these findings have diagnostic and therapeutic implications.
harmonia axyridis (coleoptera: coccinellidae) in asia: a re-examination of the native range and invasion to southeastern kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan harmonia axyridis (pallas, 1773) (coleoptera: coccinellidae) is a ladybird beetle native to temperate and subtropical parts of asia. since 1916 populations of this species have been introduced throughout the world, either deliberately, or by accident through international transport. harmonia axyridis was originally released as a classical biological control agent of aphid and coccid pests in orchards and forests, but since 1994 it is also available as a commercial product for augmentative control in field and greenhouse crops. it is a very voracious and effective natural enemy of aphids, psyllids and coccids in various agricultural and horticultural habitats and forests. during the past 20 years, however, it has successfully invaded non-target habitats in north america (since 1988), europe (1999) and south america (2001) respectively in a short period of time, attacking a wide range of non-pest species in different insect orders. becoming part of the agricultural commercial pathway, it is prone to being introduced into large areas across the world by accident. we use the climex programme (v2) to predict the potential geographical distribution of h. axyridis by means of matching the climate of its region of origin with other regions in the world and taking in account biological characteristics of the species. establishment and spread seem likely in many regions across the world, including those areas which h. axyridis has already invaded (temperate europe, north america). based on the climex prediction a large part of mediterranean europe, south america, africa, australia and new zealand seem highly suitable for long-term survival of h. axyridis as well. in addition we evaluate climex as a strategic tool for estimating establishment potential as part of an environmental risk assessment procedure for biological control agents we discuss biological and ecological aspects necessary to fine-tune its establishment and spread in areas after it has been introduced.
the case against delusional parasitosis abstract: in 2004, an article in the journal of the new york entomological society claimed that individuals with delusory parasitosis actually suffer from collembola infestations. the article has been critiqued for poor methodology and results that contradict all knowledge about collembolans. less easily accounted for has been a figure in the article purporting to show a collembolan in a skin scraping. the image appears to have been altered using photo manipulation software to an unacceptable degree, and this paper demonstrates that to be the case. the altered figure represents creation of nonexistent data, a form of scientific misconduct. whether the deception is deliberate or a product of an otherwise well-meaning author ignorant of the limits of acceptable image manipulation is unknown, but the result is peer-reviewed support for a conclusion that complicates patient treatment. in the current era of computers, even regional entomology journals must have detailed standards for what kind of images and image manipulations are acceptable for publication.
clostridium difficile heterogeneously impacts intestinal community architecture but drives stable metabolome responses defining the functional status of host-associated microbial ecosystems has proven challenging owing to the vast number of predicted genes within the microbiome and relatively poor understanding of community dynamics and community–host interaction. metabolomic approaches, in which a large number of small molecule metabolites can be defined in a biological sample, offer a promising avenue to ‘fingerprint’ microbiota functional status. here, we examined the effects of the human gut microbiota on the fecal and urinary metabolome of a humanized (hum) mouse using an optimized ultra performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry-based method. differences between hum and conventional mouse urine and fecal metabolomic profiles support host-specific aspects of the microbiota’s metabolomic contribution, consistent with distinct microbial compositions. comparison of microbiota composition and metabolome of mice humanized with different human donors revealed that the vast majority of metabolomic features observed in donor samples are produced in the corresponding hum mice, and individual-specific features suggest ‘personalized’ aspects of functionality can be reconstituted in mice. feeding the mice a defined, custom diet resulted in modification of the metabolite signatures, illustrating that host diet provides an avenue for altering gut microbiota functionality, which in turn can be monitored via metabolomics. using a defined model microbiota consisting of one or two species, we show that simplified communities can drive major changes in the host metabolomic profile. our results demonstrate that metabolomics constitutes a powerful avenue for functional characterization of the intestinal microbiota and its interaction with the host.
applicability of a segmental bioelectrical impedance analysis for predicting the whole body skeletal muscle volume. this study aimed to investigate the validity of using segmental bioelectrical impedance (bi) analysis for estimating skeletal muscle volume (mv) in the trunk, defined as the body segment from the acromion process to the greater trochanter. using a magnetic resonance imaging (mri) method, the trunk mv was determined in 28 men (19 approximately 34 yr), divided into validation (n = 20) and cross-validation (n = 8) groups, and used as a reference (mv(mri)). for bi measurements of the trunk, the source electrodes were placed at the dorsal surface of the third metacarpal bone of both hands and the dorsal surface of the third metatarsal bone of both feet, and the detector electrodes were placed at the acromion process of both shoulders and the greater trochanter of both femurs. using this arrangement, the bi values of five parts of the trunk, both sides of the upper region, the middle region, and both sides of the lower region, were obtained and then used to calculate the whole trunk bi value and bi index (bi index(tr)). in the validation group, a simple regression analysis of the relationship between bi index(tr) and mv(mri) showed a significant correlation between the two variables (r = 0.884, p < 0.05) and produced a prediction equation with a se of estimation of 1,020.3 cm3 (8.5%). in the validation and cross-validation groups, there were no significant differences between the measured and estimated mv without systematic errors. these findings indicate that the segmental bi analysis employed in the present study can be used to estimate trunk mv.
arachnoid cyst accompanied by proptosis and unilateral high myopia ipsilateral glaucoma developed in a 51-year-old man with a left-sided temporal lobe arachnoidal cyst. ultrasonic examination disclosed a cystic orbital lesion adjacent to the optic nerve. following intracranial decompensation of the arachnoidal cyst, the intraocular pressure dropped markedly. ultrasonography showed a collapse of the presumed optic nerve sheath cyst. while the exact mechanism producing glaucoma in this patient remains unclear, there was an apparent relationship between the elevated intraocular pressure and the arachnoidal cyst.
understanding e-book continuance intention: empirical evidence from e-book users in a developing country this paper examines cognitive beliefs and affect influencing one's intention to continue using (continuance) information systems (is). expectation-confirmation theory is adapted from the consumer behavior literature and integrated with theoretical and empirical findings from prior is usage research to theorize a model of is continuance. five research hypotheses derived from this model are empirically validated using a field survey of online banking users. the results suggest that users' continuance intention is determined by their satisfaction with is use and perceived usefulness of continued is use. user satisfaction, in turn, is influenced by their confirmation of expectation from prior is use and perceived usefulness. post-acceptance perceived usefulness is influenced by users' confirmation level. this study draws attention to the substantive differences between acceptance and continuance behaviors, theorizes and validates one of the earliest theoretical models of is continuance, integrates confirmation and user satisfaction constructs within our current understanding of is use, conceptualizes and creates an initial scale for measuring is continuance, and offers an initial explanation for the acceptance-discontinuance anomaly.
maillard proteomics: opening new pages the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (rage) was first described as a signal transduction receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (ages), the products of nonenzymatic glycation and oxidation of proteins and lipids that accumulate in diabetes and in inflammatory foci. the discovery that rage was a receptor for inflammatory s100/calgranulins and high mobility group box 1 (hmgb1) set the stage for linking rage to both the consequences and causes of types 1 and 2 diabetes. recent discoveries regarding the structure of rage as well as novel intracellular binding partner interactions advance our understanding of the mechanisms by which rage evokes pathological consequences and underscore strategies by which antagonism of rage in the clinic may be realized. finally, recent data tracking rage in the clinic suggest that levels of soluble rages and polymorphisms in the gene encoding rage may hold promise for the identification of patients who are vulnerable to the complications of diabetes and/or are receptive to therapeutic interventions designed to prevent and reverse the damage inflicted by chronic hyperglycemia, irrespective of its etiology.
a method for extracting a high-quality rna from symbiodinium sp. backgroundthe integrity of rna molecules is of paramount importance for experiments that try to reflect the snapshot of gene expression at the moment of rna extraction. until recently, there has been no reliable standard for estimating the integrity of rna samples and the ratio of 28s:18s ribosomal rna, the common measure for this purpose, has been shown to be inconsistent. the advent of microcapillary electrophoretic rna separation provides the basis for an automated high-throughput approach, in order to estimate the integrity of rna samples in an unambiguous way.methodsa method is introduced that automatically selects features from signal measurements and constructs regression models based on a bayesian learning technique. feature spaces of different dimensionality are compared in the bayesian framework, which allows selecting a final feature combination corresponding to models with high posterior probability.resultsthis approach is applied to a large collection of electrophoretic rna measurements recorded with an agilent 2100 bioanalyzer to extract an algorithm that describes rna integrity. the resulting algorithm is a user-independent, automated and reliable procedure for standardization of rna quality control that allows the calculation of an rna integrity number (rin).conclusionour results show the importance of taking characteristics of several regions of the recorded electropherogram into account in order to get a robust and reliable prediction of rna integrity, especially if compared to traditional methods.
fixed-dose versus off-label combination of isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine hydrochloride: retrospective propensity-matched analysis in black medicare patients with heart failure background although multiple therapies have been shown to lower mortality in patients with heart failure (hf) and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, their application in clinical practice has been less than ideal. to date, empiric estimation of the potential benefits that could be gained from eliminating these existing treatment gaps with optimal implementation has not been quantified.   methods eligibility criteria for each evidence-based hf therapy, the estimated frequency of use/nonuse of specific treatments, the case fatality rates, and the risk reductions due to treatment were obtained from published sources. the numbers of deaths prevented or postponed because of each guideline-recommended therapy and overall were determined.   results among patients with hf with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction in the united states (n = 2,644,800), the number eligible but not currently treated ranged from 139,749 for hydralazine/isorbide dinitrate to 852,512 for implantable cardioverter defibrillators. the comparative number of deaths that could potentially be prevented per year with optimal implementation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor antagonist is 6,516; β-blockers, 12,922; aldosterone antagonists, 21,407; hydralazine/isorbide dinitrate, 6,655; cardiac resynchronization therapy, 8,317; and implantable cardioverter defibrillators, 12,179. if these treatment benefits were additive, optimal implementation of all 6 therapies could potentially prevent 67,996 deaths a year.   conclusions a substantial number of hf deaths in this country could potentially be prevented by optimal implementation of evidence-based therapies. these data may underscore the importance of performance improvement efforts to translate evidence-based therapy to routine clinical practice so as to reduce contemporary hf mortality.
unusual configurations of personality traits indicate multiple patterns of their coalescence it is argued that if we compute self-other agreement on some personality traits then we possess no or very little information about the individuals who are the targets of this judgment. this idea is largely based on two separate ways of computing self-other agreement: trait agreement (rt) and profile agreement (rp), which are typically associated with two different trait-centered and person-centered approaches in personality research. personality traits of 4115 targets from czech, belgian, estonian, and german samples were rated by themselves and knowledgeable informants. we demonstrate that trait agreement can be partialled into individual contributions so that it is possible to show how much each individual pair of judges contributes to agreement on a particular trait. similarly, it is possible to decompose agreement between two personality profiles into the individual contributions of traits from which these profiles are assembled. if normativeness is separated from distinctiveness of personality scores and individual profiles are ipsatized, then mean profile agreement rp becomes identical to mean trait agreement rt. the views that trait-by-trait analysis does not provide information regarding accuracy level of a particular pair of judges and profile analysis does not permit assessment of the relative contributions of traits to overall accuracy are not supported.
economic estimation of the losses caused by surface water pollution accidents in china from the perspective of water bodies’ functions eutrophication has many known consequences, but there are few data on the environmental and health costs. we developed a new framework of cost categories that assess both social and ecological damage costs and policy response costs. these findings indicate the severe effects of nutrient enrichment and eutrophication on many sectors of the economy. we estimate the damage costs of freshwater eutrophication in england and wales to be $105-160 million yr(-1) (pound 75.0-114.3 m). the policy response costs are a measure of how much is being spent to address this damage, and these amount to $77 million yr(-1) pound 54.8 m). the damage costs are dominated by seven items each with costs of $15 million yr(-1) or more: reduced value of waterfront dwellings, drinking water treatment costs for nitrogen removal, reduced recreational and amenity value of water bodies, drinking water treatment costs for removal of algal toxins and decomposition products, reduced value of nonpolluted atmosphere, negative ecological effects on biota, and net economic losses from the tourist industry. in common with other environmental problems, it would represent net value (or cost reduction) if damage was prevented at source. a variety of effective economic, regulatory, and administrative policy instruments are available for internalizing these costs.

amelioration of arthritis through mobilization of peptide-specific cd8+ regulatory t cells. animal models have been used extensively in studies of rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis. despite the inherent limitations of all animal models, several rodent models have significantly progressed our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underpinning rheumatoid arthritis and contributed to several current major advances in treatment. these models include the induced arthritis models such as collagen‐induced arthritis, collagen‐antibody‐induced arthritis, zymosan‐induced arthritis, and the methylated bsa model, and the genetically manipulated or spontaneous arthritis models such as the tnf‐α‐transgenic mouse, k/bxn mouse, and the skg mouse. here, we describe these animal models and discuss their advantages and limitations.
physical activity among lung cancer survivors: changes across the cancer trajectory and associations with quality of life the american cancer society (acs) publishes nutrition and physical activity guidelines to serve as a foundation for its communication, policy, and community strategies and, ultimately, to affect dietary and physical activity patterns among americans. these guidelines, published approximately every 5 years, are developed by a national panel of experts in cancer research, prevention, epidemiology, public health, and policy, and they reflect the most current scientific evidence related to dietary and activity patterns and cancer risk. the acs guidelines focus on recommendations for individual choices regarding diet and physical activity patterns, but those choices occur within a community context that either facilitates or creates barriers to healthy behaviors. therefore, this committee presents recommendations for community action to accompany the 4 recommendations for individual choices to reduce cancer risk. these recommendations for community action recognize that a supportive social and physical environment is indispensable if individuals at all levels of society are to have genuine opportunities to choose healthy behaviors. the acs guidelines are consistent with guidelines from the american heart association and the american diabetes association for the prevention of coronary heart disease and diabetes, as well as for general health promotion, as defined by the 2010 dietary guidelines for americans and the 2008 physical activity guidelines for americans. ca cancer j clin 2012. © 2012 american cancer society.
impacts of sediments on coral energetics: partitioning the effects of turbidity and settling particles summarydespite the pre-eminence of the great barrier reef, there has been little systematic description of its biotic communities, and in particular, of the corals themselves. only recently have the problems of coral taxonomy been sufficiently resolved to allow a beginning to be made in rectifying this deficiency. the present study describes seventeen assemblages of corals which occupy the major habitat types found in and near the central great barrier reef. the habitats studied range from the wave swept reef flats of coral sea atolls to the slopes of small reefs occupying sheltered, muddy conditions near the coast. these, and the array of reefs between, have characteristic suites of coral communities which provide the basis for a classification of reefs into non-acropora reefs and various acropora reefs. it is speculated that the faunistic differences are maintained because reefs are primarily self-seeded and because the majority of larvae from external sources are of species which are already present. the greatest diversity of both species and community types was found on reefs near the middle of the continental shelf, while the oceanic atolls and nearshore silt-affected reefs are almost equally depauperate.
moving beyond the therapeutic relationship: a selective review of intimacy in the sexual health encounter in nursing practice. teaching sex education to school pupils in scotland continues to be a controversial issue. in reality there is lack of leadership, strategy and an uncoordinated approach to delivering this important topic. the school nurse is frequently identified as a suitable professional to lead the way because it is assumed that school nurses are well educated in the field of sexual and reproductive health. nationally, little is known about the educational status of scottish school nurses and there is no research evidence available from which generalisations can be made. this study aims to explore the educational preparation of school nurses that underpins teaching sex education to school pupils in scotland. a cross-sectional descriptive study was completed in september 1998. the results confirmed that school nurses in scotland are predominantly female and 70% of the respondents (n=117) were over the age of 40 years of age. no common basic nursing qualification was identified. the majority of school nurses in scotland perceive sex education to be part of their role and 39% (n=65) testified that specific sexual health training had been undertaken. many lack confidence in this area of practice and are aware of extensive educational needs in relation to teaching sexual health and reproductive health. despite these findings 75% (n=126) were actively involved in teaching sex education to school pupils.
phylogenetic information and experimental design in molecular systematics summarythe application of maximum likelihood techniques to the estimation of evolutionary trees from nucleic acid sequence data is discussed. a computationally feasible method for finding such maximum likelihood estimates is developed, and a computer program is available. this method has advantages over the traditional parsimony algorithms, which can give misleading results if rates of evolution differ in different lineages. it also allows the testing of hypotheses about the constancy of evolutionary rates by likelihood ratio tests, and gives rough indication of the error of the estimate of the tree.
institutional barriers to growth: entrepreneurship, human capital and institutional change many widely used economic models implicitly assume that income shares should be identical across time and space. although time series data from industrial countries appear consistent with this notion, cross-section data generally appear to contradict the assumption of constant income shares. a commonly used calculation suggests that labor shares of national income vary from about 0.05 to about 0.80 in international cross-section data. this paper suggests, however, that this widely used approach underestimates the labor income of the selfemployed and other proprietors. several adjustments for calculating labor shares are identified and compared. all of them yield data that appear broadly consistent with the hypothesis that labor shares for most countries fall in the range of 0.65 to 0.80.
low serum bdnf and food intake regulation: a possible new explanation of the pathophysiology of eating disorders objective data suggest the involvement of serotonergic and neurotrophic systems in major depressive disorder. to investigate their potential interaction, the authors studied changes in serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) during tryptophan depletion and sham depletion in unmedicated patients with remitted major depressive disorder and in a group of healthy comparison subjects.   method twenty-seven patients with remitted major depressive disorder and 20 healthy subjects underwent tryptophan depletion and sham depletion in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study. serum bdnf concentrations and plasma tryptophan concentrations as well as behavioral assessments were obtained.   results during tryptophan depletion, bdnf levels increased in healthy volunteers. by contrast, patients with remitted major depressive disorder were unable to mount this presumed compensatory response, and bdnf levels remained low in these patients.   conclusions the results further substantiate the potential role of bdnf in major depressive disorder.
epidemiology of fractures in armenia: development of a country-specific frax model and comparison to its surrogate summarythe incidence of hip, forearm and humeral fractures was studied in two cities from the russian federation. fracture rates were used to create a frax model for russia and to estimate the current and future burden of fracture.purposethere is scant information on the epidemiology of fracture in russia. the aim of the study was to determine the incidence of major fractures in order to populate a new frax model and to characterise the burden and future burden of fractures.methodsthe number of hip, forearm and humeral fractures was determined in two russian cities with a well-defined catchment population over a 2–3-year period. incidence rates for the two cities were merged and used to populate a frax model for russia. incidence rates were also applied to the general population in 2010 and 25 years later in 2035.resultsa total of 6,012 fractures were documented. for hip fracture, 27 % of cases in pervouralsk and 1.8 % in yaroslavl were not registered in the hospital data base. the incidence of index fractures increased with age and was higher in women than in men. the lifetime probability of hip fracture at the age of 50 years was 4 % in men and 7 % in women. the total number of hip fractures estimated in 2010 (112,000) is expected to rise to 159,000 in 2035. the estimated number of major fractures will rise from 590,000 to 730,000 over the same time interval.conclusionsfragility fractures pose a serious health care problem in russia. urgent steps are needed to improve the acute management of hip fracture and long-term care of other osteoporotic fractures.
lesions of the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices in the monkey produce long-lasting memory impairment in the visual and tactual modalities monkeys with stereotaxic lesions of the amygdaloid complex that spared the surrounding cortex (i.e., the periamygdaloid, entorhinal, and perirhinal cortices) performed normally on the delayed nonmatching to sample task, as well as on 3 other memory tasks (object retention, concurrent discrimination, and delayed response) administered during the 1 1/2 years after surgery. these animals also performed normally on pattern discrimination and motor-skill learning, 2 tasks analogous to ones amnesic patients perform well. a second group of monkeys with conjoint lesions that included both the amygdaloid complex, as just described, and the hippocampal formation were impaired on the same 4 memory tasks. however, the severity of impairment in this group was no greater than in monkeys with lesions of the hippocampal formation alone. thus, circumscribed bilateral lesions of the amygdala did not impair performance on 4 different memory tasks, nor did they exacerbate the memory impairment that followed hippocampal formation lesions alone. these findings suggest that one must look to structures other than the amygdala to account for the severe memory impairment that follows large lesions of the medial temporal region. one possibility is that damage to the cortical regions that surround the amygdala contributes to memory impairment.
screening for inhalational anthrax due to bioterrorism: evaluating proposed screening protocols. context in the event of a bioterrorist attack, it may be difficult to distinguish inhalational anthrax from viral respiratory tract disease. contribution this synthesis compares reported symptoms of 28 patients with inhalational anthrax and 4694 patients with viral respiratory tract illnesses. fever and cough were common in both infections. mental confusion or loss of consciousness, shortness of breath, and nausea and vomiting more often indicated anthrax, whereas sore throat and runny nose more often indicated viral infection. implications several symptoms, including neurologic and gastrointestinal symptoms and shortness of breath, may help distinguish inhalational anthrax from respiratory viral illness. the editors the 2001 anthrax attacks in the united states, in which 11 people developed the inhalational form of the disease and 5 died, exposed a weakness in the u.s. medical response to bioterrorism (1). despite heroic efforts on behalf of the victims, physicians were largely unprepared to recognize the early symptoms and signs of this extremely rare and rapidly progressive infection in ambulatory patients (2). initially, 4 of the 11 patients were sent home after being seen as outpatients or in an emergency department with diagnoses that included viral syndrome, bronchitis, and gastroenteritis (3, 4). physicians first considered a diagnosis of anthrax in 2 of these patients (both postal workers) on their second visits to the emergency department and then only after hearing media reports of illness among other postal employees (3). inhalation of anthrax spores leads to clinical disease from elaboration of two toxins, a calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase known as edema factor and a zinc metalloproteinase called lethal factor, by phagocytosed bacteria in the mediastinal lymph nodes and bloodstream (5). classic pathologic findings include hemorrhagic mediastinitis and hemorrhagic meningitis; primary anthrax pneumonia is rare (6, 7). without prompt treatment, death occurs rapidly from a combination of shock and respiratory compromise. anthrax has been classified by the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention as one of six category a bioterrorist agents posing the greatest risk to civilian populations (8). a large-scale anthrax attack has the potential to cause casualties on a scale that would quickly overwhelm local and regional health care treatment capacity (6). the emergency response to such an attack would probably include the establishment of multiple mass prophylaxis centers physically distinct from hospital emergency departments (to prevent overcrowding and potential contamination) for rapid dispensing of prophylactic antibiotics to exposed populations and for identifying individuals suspected of having inhalational anthrax (9). presumptive cases would be transferred to established or temporary medical care facilities for rapid definitive testing and initiation of combination antimicrobial treatment, which may improve outcomes (10-12). efficient management of this limited medical care capacity is an important secondary goal of outpatient triage during a bioterrorism response (13, 14). screening and triage protocols used in these settings would need to rely on presenting symptoms and signs because laboratory or radiographic testing will probably not be feasible in high-volume mass prophylaxis centers (15). we sought to establish an evidence base for developing a screening protocol for inhalational anthrax. the utility of such a protocol, which improves both case detection and case exclusion, would also extend beyond the immediate mass prophylaxis setting because large numbers of individuals outside the exposure zone will probably seek reassurance from health care providers for symptomatic illnesses in the aftermath of a major attack. providing scientific evidence on which to base these discussions may decrease postattack anxiety and inappropriate utilization of health care resources (16). methods clinical data on the 11 inhalational anthrax cases of 2001 are now widely available (3, 4, 17-20). because of the small number of cases in the contemporary attack, we performed a systematic literature review to identify additional original case reports of inhalational anthrax in the english-language medical literature. we searched two computerized databases (medline and web of science) for adult human case reports of anthrax infection between 1960 and 2000 using the keywords anthrax and case report. this yielded 44 references; 4 contained sufficient clinical data on inhalational anthrax to permit comparison with the 11 contemporary cases (21-24). tracing bibliographies of these articles and a recent review article (25) produced an additional 7 articles that were appropriate for inclusion, for a total of 11 reports on 17 cases (26-32). two of the cases involved patients from outside of the united states (22, 24). we interpreted lack of mention of a specific symptom or abnormal sign in these reports as indicating the absence of that finding from the patient's clinical presentation. we compared proportions of symptoms and signs in historical and contemporary cases using the fisher exact test; clinical features that had consistent prevalence rates in earlier and contemporary cases were candidates for comparison with viral respiratory tract disease. viral respiratory tract infections, such as with influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), parainfluenza, and rhinoviruses or coronaviruses, are appropriate comparison conditions for this study because of their prevalence and potential similarity to inhalational anthrax (15, 33). we searched medline for descriptive epidemiologic reports of presenting clinical features of laboratory-confirmed influenza and noninfluenza viral respiratory illnesses in ambulatory adults; we found five published studies that met the search criteria (34-38). we did not include studies that describe samples of mixed influenza and noninfluenza cases (39-42) or that present data already reported in these five studies (43). we did not compare anthrax cases with asymptomatic persons (because they would not present a screening dilemma) or with acutely ill patients (because they would probably not participate in mass screening). since there are no reports of inhalational anthrax in pediatric patients, we limited our comparison sample to adult patients. finally, we also compared anthrax cases to ambulatory patients with community-acquired pneumonia to highlight the difficulty of distinguishing these two conditions (44). we calculated positive likelihood ratios with 95% cis for the presence of selected signs and symptoms in inhalational anthrax versus influenza, influenza-like illness, and ambulatory community-acquired pneumonia. the positive likelihood ratio is defined here as the prevalence of a symptom or sign among inhalational anthrax cases divided by the prevalence of the same symptom or sign in the influenza, influenza-like illness, or pneumonia comparison groups. the positive likelihood ratio is the multiplicative factor that increases or decreases the odds of having inhalational anthrax as opposed to one of these comparison diseases, given the presence of a clinical finding (45). therefore, the post-test probability of having inhalational anthrax is influenced by both the magnitude of the positive likelihood ratio and the pretest probability of having the disease (46). in the appropriate clinical setting (that is, when the pretest probability of having the target disease is not zero), likelihood ratios greater than 3 or less than 0.3 are considered clinically important (47). the general approach used heredeveloping diagnostic algorithms for rare diagnoses by using likelihood ratios and by establishing hypothetical comparison groups populated by common medical conditionshas been previously described (46, 48, 49). the study sponsors had no role in the design, conduct, and reporting of the data or in the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. results presenting symptoms and signs and radiographic results for the 11 deliberately infected contemporary cases and 17 occupationally or environmentally infected historical cases were similar, although contemporary patients reported significantly more fever/chills and fatigue or malaise (table 1). all but 1 of the 28 patients (including 100% of the contemporary patients) had fever, chills, or cough on presentation. (the single exception was a patient who presented with impending shock, which limited the ability to record a complete history.) other symptoms that affected more than half of all patients included dyspnea (68%), chest discomfort or pain (61%), and nausea or vomiting (61%). more than half of current case-patients and 43% of the combined sample presented with neurologic symptoms other than headache, including confusion, blurred vision, and dizziness. only a few patients with inhalational anthrax reported sore throat (18%) or rhinorrhea (14%). table 1. summary of symptoms and signs at initial presentation: historical versus contemporary patients with inhalational anthrax eighty-one percent of patients presented with abnormalities on lung auscultation, including rales or rhonchi (65%) and dullness or decreased breath sounds (58%). respiratory symptoms often did not match findings on lung physical examination. four of the five patients with no respiratory symptoms had positive findings (rales), whereas 8 of the 23 patients with respiratory symptoms had no abnormality on lung examination. outcomes differed significantly between historical and contemporary patients: 16 of the 17 historical patients died compared with only 5 of the 11 contemporary patients. the presenting clinical features of the 28 patients can be divided into nine symptom complexes involving respiratory; gastrointestinal; ear, nose, and throat; and nonheadache neurologic problems (figure 1). the single most common presentation was a combination of respirato
effect of wear on stress distributions and potential fracture in teeth tooth enamel is inherently weak, with fracture toughness comparable with glass, yet it is remarkably resilient, surviving millions of functional contacts over a lifetime. we propose a microstructural mechanism of damage resistance, based on observations from ex situ loading of human and sea otter molars (teeth with strikingly similar structural features). section views of the enamel implicate tufts, hypomineralized crack-like defects at the enamel–dentin junction, as primary fracture sources. we report a stabilization in the evolution of these defects, by “stress shielding” from neighbors, by inhibition of ensuing crack extension from prism interweaving (decussation), and by self-healing. these factors, coupled with the capacity of the tooth configuration to limit the generation of tensile stresses in largely compressive biting, explain how teeth may absorb considerable damage over time without catastrophic failure, an outcome with strong implications concerning the adaptation of animal species to diet.
the tgfβ pathway is a key player for the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition in the embryonic aorta. haematopoietic stem cells (hscs) are the founder cells of the adult haematopoietic system, and thus knowledge of the molecular program directing their generation during development is important for regenerative haematopoietic strategies. runx1 is a pivotal transcription factor required for hsc generation in the vascular regions of the mouse conceptus—the aorta, vitelline and umbilical arteries, yolk sac and placenta. it is thought that hscs emerge from vascular endothelial cells through the formation of intra-arterial clusters and that runx1 functions during the transition from ‘haemogenic endothelium’ to hscs. here we show by conditional deletion that runx1 activity in vascular-endothelial-cadherin-positive endothelial cells is indeed essential for intra-arterial cluster, haematopoietic progenitor and hsc formation in mice. in contrast, runx1 is not required in cells expressing vav1, one of the first pan-haematopoietic genes expressed in hscs. collectively these data show that runx1 function is essential in endothelial cells for haematopoietic progenitor and hsc formation from the vasculature, but its requirement ends once or before vav is expressed.
kisspeptin receptor gpr54 promotes adipocyte differentiation and fat accumulation in mice aims/hypothesiswe investigated the production of kisspeptin (kiss1) and the kiss1 receptor, gpr54, in pancreatic islets and determined the effects of exogenous kisspeptin on insulin secretion.methodsrt-pcr and immunohistochemistry were used to detect expression of kiss1 and gpr54 mrnas and the production of kiss1 and gpr54 in human and mouse islets and in beta (min6) and alpha- (alphatc1) cell lines. the effects of kiss1 on basal and glucose-induced insulin secretion from mouse and human islets were measured in a perifusion system.resultskiss1 and gpr54 mrnas were both detected in human and mouse islets, and gpr54 mrna expression was also found in the min6 and alphatc1 endocrine cell lines. in sections of mouse pancreas, kiss1 and gpr54 immunoreactivities were co-localised in both beta and alpha cells within islets, but were not detected in the exocrine pancreas. exposure of mouse and human islets to kiss1 caused a stimulation of glucose-induced (20 mmol/l) insulin secretion, but had no effect on the basal rate of secretion at a sub-stimulatory concentration of glucose (2 mmol/l). in contrast, kiss1 inhibited insulin secretion from min6 cells at both 2 and 20 mmol/l glucose. kiss1 had no significant effect on glucagon secretion from mouse islets.conclusions/interpretationthis is the first report to show that the gpr54/kiss1 system is expressed in the endocrine pancreas, where it influences beta cell secretory function. these observations suggest an important role for this system in the normal regulation of islet function.
the distal limb environment regulates myod accumulation and muscle differentiation in mouse-chick chimaeric limbs. we have utilized a key biochemical determinant of muscle fiber type, myosin isoform expression, to investigate the initial developmental program of future fast and slow skeletal muscle fibers. we examined myosin heavy chain (hc) phenotype from the onset of myogenesis in the limb bud muscle masses of the chick embryo through the differentiation of individual fast and slow muscle masses, as well as in newly formed myotubes generated in adult muscle by weight overload. myosin hc isoform expression was analyzed by immunofluorescence localization with a battery of anti-myosin antibodies and by electrophoretic separation with sds-page. results showed that the initial myosin phenotype in all skeletal muscle cells formed during the embryonic period (until at least 8 days in ovo) consisted of expression of a myosin hc which shares antigenic and electrophoretic migratory properties with ventricular myosin and a distinct myosin hc which shares antigenic and electrophoretic migratory properties with fast skeletal isomyosin. similar results were observed in newly formed myotubes in adult muscle. future fast and slow muscle fibers could only be discriminated from each other in developing limb bud muscles by the onset of expression of slow skeletal myosin hc at 6 days in ovo. slow skeletal myosin hc was expressed only in myotubes which became slow fibers. these findings suggest that the initial commitment of skeletal muscle progenitor cells is to a common skeletal muscle lineage and that commitment to a fiber-specific lineage may not occur until after localization of myogenic cells in appropriate premuscle masses. thus, the process of localization, or events which occur soon thereafter, may be involved in determining fiber type.
titan cell production in cryptococcus neoformans reshapes the cell wall and capsule composition during infection the pathogenesis of cryptococcus neoformans infection has been studied extensively with respect to inflammatory and pathological changes, but very little information is available regarding the morphology of yeast cells during the course of infection. electron microscopy of cryptococcus neoformans in murine pulmonary infection revealed increased cell wall thickness with time, but this difference was only partially accounted for by increases in cell diameter. cell walls of melanized cells were thicker than those of nonmelanized cells 2 h after infection, and the cell wall of yeast became blacker with time, suggesting that melanization contributes to the increased cell wall thickness. heterogeneous cell populations emerged, with the appearance of giant forms. while for c. neoformans atcc strain 24067 (serotype d) the full spectrum of cell sizes were observed, for strains h99 (serotype a) and 3501 (serotype d) cells were divisible into two populations, giant and micro forms. in contrast to cellular heterogeneity, the epitope recognized by a protective mab on the capsular glucuronoxylomannan (gxm) was found at all times of infection. immunoelectron microscopy using mabs to gxm demonstrated reactivity with intracellular structures, suggesting that synthesis of capsular polysaccharide occurs, at least in part, in the cytoplasm. in summary, the results indicate that: (i) the infection is dynamic with respect to yeast cell morphology; (ii) giant cell forms arise in tissue during the course of infection; (iii) cell walls blacken and thicken during the course of infection, consistent with melanin synthesis during infection; and (iv) gxm epitopes are found in the capsule, cell wall and cytoplasm, consistent with intracellular polysaccharide synthesis. the results indicate that the population of c. neoformans cells in tissue is in a highly dynamic state, implying that the immune system must confront cells with varying characteristics during the course of infection.
an fpga implementation architecture for decoding of polar codes the two central topics of information theory are the compression and the transmission of data. shannon, in his seminal work, formalized both these problems and determined their fundamental limits. since then the main goal of coding theory has been to find practical schemes that approach these limits. polar codes, recently invented by arikan, are the first "practical" codes that are known to achieve the capacity for a large class of channels. their code construction is based on a phenomenon called "channel polarization". the encoding as well as the decoding operation of polar codes can be implemented with o(n log n) complexity, where n is the blocklength of the code. we show that polar codes are suitable not only for channel coding but also achieve optimal performance for several other important problems in information theory. the first problem we consider is lossy source compression. we construct polar codes that asymptotically approach shannon's rate-distortion bound for a large class of sources. we achieve this performance by designing polar codes according to the "test channel", which naturally appears in shannon's formulation of the rate-distortion function. the encoding operation combines the successive cancellation algorithm of arikan with a crucial new ingredient called "randomized rounding". as for channel coding, both the encoding as well as the decoding operation can be implemented with o(n log n) complexity. this is the first known "practical" scheme that approaches the optimal rate-distortion trade-off. we also construct polar codes that achieve the optimal performance for the wyner-ziv and the gelfand-pinsker problems. both these problems can be tackled using "nested" codes and polar codes are naturally suited for this purpose. we further show that polar codes achieve the capacity of asymmetric channels, multi-terminal scenarios like multiple access channels, and degraded broadcast channels. for each of these problems, our constructions are the first known "practical" schemes that approach the optimal performance. the original polar codes of arikan achieve a block error probability decaying exponentially in the square root of the block length. for source coding, the gap between the achieved distortion and the limiting distortion also vanishes exponentially in the square root of the blocklength. we explore other polar-like code constructions with better rates of decay. with this generalization, we show that close to exponential decays can be obtained for both channel and source coding. the new constructions mimic the recursive construction of arikan and, hence, they inherit the same encoding and decoding complexity. we also propose algorithms based on message-passing to improve the finite length performance of polar codes. in the final two chapters of this thesis we address two important problems in graphical models related to communications. the first problem is in the area of low-density parity-check codes (ldpc). for practical lengths, ldpc codes using message-passing decoding are still the codes to beat. the current analysis, using density evolution, evaluates the performance of these algorithms on a tree. the tree assumption corresponds to using an infinite length code. but in practice, the codes are of finite length. we analyze the message-passing algorithms for this scenario. the absence of tree assumption introduces correlations between various messages. we show that despite this correlation, the prediction of the tree analysis is accurate. the second problem we consider is related to code division multiple access (cdma) communication using random spreading. the current analysis mainly focuses on the information theoretic limits, i.e., using gaussian input distribution. however in practice we use modulation schemes like binary phase-shift keying (bpsk), which is far from being gaussian. the effects of the modulation scheme cannot be analyzed using traditional tools which are based on spectrum of large random matrices. we follow a new approach using tools developed for random spin systems in statistical mechanics. we prove a tight upper bound on the capacity of the system when the user input is bpsk. we also show that the capacity depends only on the power of the spreading sequences and is independent of their exact distribution.
predictors of postprandial hypotension in elderly patients with de novo parkinson’s disease postprandial hypotension was first recognized as a clinical problem in 1977 in a patient with parkinson disease [1]. however, the hypotensive effect of meal ingestion has been appreciated for a longer time. in 1935, gladstone [2] described a hypertensive patient who had had a postprandial decrease in blood pressure from 185/120 mm hg to 145/80 mm hg. in 1953, smirk [3] observed a decrease in blood pressure after patients with autonomic failure ingested food. robertson and colleagues [4] confirmed these results in patients with chronic autonomic failure and found an average decrease in systolic blood pressure of 49 6 mm hg after a meal [4]. since lipsitz and colleagues [5] first described it in nursing home residents a decade ago, postprandial hypotension has become recognized as a common disorder of blood pressure regulation in the elderly [5]. our current understanding of postprandial hypotension is limited by the lack of a standardized, clinically meaningful definition. analogous to orthostatic hypotension, postprandial hypotension is commonly defined in the literature as a decrease in systolic blood pressure of 20 mm hg or more within 2 hours of the start of a meal. postprandial hypotension also develops when the absolute level of systolic blood pressure after a meal decreases to less than 90 mm hg and when the systolic blood pressure before a meal is greater than 100 mm hg. in addition, if a meal-related decrease in systolic blood pressure exceeds the threshold for cerebral autoregulation, patients may become symptomatic when the absolute systolic blood pressure level exceeds 90 mm hg or when the postprandial systolic blood pressure decreases to less than 20 mm hg. the frequent absence of symptoms associated with this decrease in blood pressure after meal ingestion makes the value of this definition uncertain. in addition, the morbidity and mortality related to postprandial hypotension are unknown. a potential cumulative effect of multiple hypotensive stresses, such as posture change or administration of medication at the time of meal ingestion, makes assessment of the clinical relevance of individual blood pressure responses to a meal even more difficult. although it can be exacerbated by posture change, postprandial hypotension is a distinct entity that differs from orthostatic hypotension. we have reviewed the current knowledge of the epidemiology, clinical symptoms and significance, pathophysiology, and management of postprandial hypotension. we hope to make the practicing physician more aware of this common abnormality in blood pressure regulation and to stimulate new research of its mechanisms and management. methods through a medline search, we identified all articles on postprandial hypertension published between 1966 and 1994. we also used the bibliographies of relevant articles. all articles and case reports describing meal-related hypotension in the elderly and in patients with autonomic failure were included for analysis. epidemiology and associated conditions during the past decade, hypotension in response to ingestion of a mixed meal or oral glucose has been shown in healthy elderly persons [6-14]; young and elderly persons with hypertension [10, 15-21]; elderly patients in nursing homes [5, 22-25]; and patients with postprandial syncope [26, 27], autonomic insufficiency [4, 28-36], parkinson disease [1, 37-39], paraplegia [40], diabetes mellitus [28, 38, 41], cardiovascular disease [42, 43], and renal failure treated with hemodialysis [44, 45]. however, the epidemiology of postprandial hypotension has not been thoroughly studied. mild, meal-induced decreases in blood pressure are common in healthy older persons [6-11], but the prevalence of these decreases is unknown. the presence of multiple illnesses in elderly persons may further impair cardiovascular adaptation to meal ingestion and result in marked postprandial decreases in blood pressure. investigations of elderly persons living in nursing homes have shown that nearly all persons experience some decrease in blood pressure [24, 25]. in 24% to 36% of these patients, systolic blood pressure decreases more than 20 mm hg within 75 minutes of eating a meal [24, 25]. it has been difficult to dissociate the effects of physiologic aging on postprandial blood pressure regulation from those of age-associated illnesses. the elevation in blood pressure associated with aging can profoundly influence postprandial blood pressure. in a study of 82 healthy persons aged 19 to 79 years, meal-related reductions in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly correlated. however, when the data were corrected for baseline blood pressure, this correlation was no longer seen [46]. older hypertensive persons have greater reductions in blood pressure after ingesting food or oral glucose than do age-matched normotensive persons [7, 9, 10, 17-20]. postprandial decreases in systolic blood pressure ranging from 17 to 25 mm hg have been found in hypertensive elderly patients older than age 65 years who did not have other overt cardiovascular diseases [9, 10, 17, 18]. in these patients, diastolic blood pressure may decrease as much as 15 mm hg. however, because hypertensive middle-aged and young persons also have postprandial decreases in blood pressure [10, 16], this phenomenon may be primarily caused by blood pressure elevation rather than by aging itself. profound postprandial hypotension has been observed in patients with autonomic failure [1, 4, 28-36, 47, 48]. the first case report described a 65-year-old man who had dizziness and visual disturbance associated with large decreases in blood pressure after almost every meal [1]. robertson and colleagues [4] found a marked postprandial decrease in sitting systolic blood pressure (range, 22 to 98 mm hg) in 10 patients with autonomic failure. hoeldtke and associates [28, 47] studied patients with multiple-system atrophy (the shy-drager syndrome) and pure autonomic failure and found that the decrease in the mean sitting postprandial arterial blood pressure ranged from 62 to 83 mm hg [28, 47]. all of these patients had blurred vision and dizziness after the meal [47]. postprandial hypotension is also commonly found in patients with peripheral neuropathy caused by diabetes mellitus or other disorders [28, 33, 38, 41] as well as by parkinson disease [1, 37-39]. hypotension is a common side effect of antiparkinsonian drugs such as levodopa. in patients with renal failure, symptomatic postprandial hypotension has been seen during hemodialysis [44, 45]. this appears to be relevant primarily in uremic patients who have autonomic dysfunction. determining the prevalence and clinical implications of postprandial hypotension is complicated not only by different diseases and drugs in the populations studied but also by methodologic inconsistencies among studies. first, the body's position while the meal is being consumed probably affects food-induced changes in blood pressure. postprandial hypotension occurs both in the sitting and supine positions. although the sitting position is more physiologic, orthostatic changes in blood pressure during prolonged sitting might contribute to the postprandial decrease in blood pressure. second, no studies have addressed the variability of postprandial blood pressure. previous studies have shown that orthostatic blood pressure measurements in the elderly vary considerably from day to day [49]. this could also be true for postprandial hypotension. third, the nutrient composition of meals affects the magnitude of the decrease in postprandial blood pressure [12, 13, 15, 50]. carbohydrates and, more specifically, glucose have been found to play a significant role [10, 29]. however, conflicting data have been reported about the influence of fat or protein on postprandial blood pressure [12, 13, 15, 51, 52]. fourth, postprandial hypotension depends on the temperature of the meal [53]. after cold glucose solutions are ingested, blood pressure remains unchanged, whereas glucose solutions served warm or at room temperature cause a decrease in blood pressure. finally, the time at which blood pressure is measured after a meal may influence the detection of this phenomenon. postprandial hypotension can be found at all meal times [14] and is almost immediately apparent after a meal. blood pressure usually reaches a nadir within 30 to 60 minutes. in nursing home residents, the systolic blood pressure nadir occurred as early as 15 minutes after the meal in 13% to 17% of the patients and as late as 75 minutes after the meal in 11% to 13% of the patients [24, 25]. clinical symptoms and significance in elderly persons or patients with autonomic failure, postprandial reductions in blood pressure may result in syncope, falls, angina pectoris, weakness, dizziness, nausea, lightheadedness, or black spots in the visual field [1, 5, 22, 24-26, 29, 39, 46] (table 1). in addition, case reports have described elderly patients with large postprandial reductions in blood pressure who developed angina pectoris or transient ischemic attacks that resolved as blood pressure returned to normal [24, 54]. however, data on the frequency of postprandial hypotension and its potential symptoms are scarce. in one recent study, half of a group of patients with unexplained syncope had postprandial hypotension [27]. table 1. clinical symptoms associated with postprandial hypotension the cerebral symptoms probably depend on the extent to which cerebral perfusion is compromised. accumulation of age- and disease-related conditions that threaten cerebral blood flow or reduce oxygen content in the blood may bring cerebral oxygen delivery near the threshold needed to maintain consciousness [55]. therefore, even small changes in blood pressure may reduce cerebral oxygen delivery to below the critical threshold and thus result in ischemic symptoms. the potential for postprandial cerebral ischemia may be greater in elderly p
phylogeographical patterns shed light on evolutionary process in south america the making of amazonian diversity the biodiversity of the amazon basin is legendary, but the processes by which it has been generated have been debated. in the late 20th century the prevalent view was that the engine of diversity was repeated contraction and expansion of forest refugia during the past 3 million years or so. hoorn et al. (p. 927) analyze findings from a diverse range of disciplines, including molecular phylogeny, ecology, sedimentology, structural geology, and palaeontology, to offer an overview of the entire history of this region during the cenozoic era (66 million years ago). the uplift of the andes was a pivotal event in the evolution of amazonian landscapes because it continually altered river drainage patterns, which in turn put a variety of pressures on organisms to adapt to changing conditions in a multiplicity of ways. hence, the diversity of the modern biota of the amazon has more ancient origins than previously thought. the amazonian rainforest is arguably the most species-rich terrestrial ecosystem in the world, yet the timing of the origin and evolutionary causes of this diversity are a matter of debate. we review the geologic and phylogenetic evidence from amazonia and compare it with uplift records from the andes. this uplift and its effect on regional climate fundamentally changed the amazonian landscape by reconfiguring drainage patterns and creating a vast influx of sediments into the basin. on this “andean” substrate, a region-wide edaphic mosaic developed that became extremely rich in species, particularly in western amazonia. we show that andean uplift was crucial for the evolution of amazonian landscapes and ecosystems, and that current biodiversity patterns are rooted deep in the pre-quaternary.
climatic forcing on channel profiles in the eastern cordillera of the coroico region, bolivia the bolivian andes flank one of earth’s major topographic features and dominate sediment input into the amazon basin. millennial-scale erosion rates and dominant controls on erosion patterns in this range are poorly known. to define these patterns, we present 48 erosion rate estimates, derived from analysis of in situ 10 be in quartz-bearing alluvium collected from the upper beni river basin. erosion rates, corrected for the non-uniform distribution of quartz in the sample basins, range from 0·04 mm a −1 to 1·35 mm a −1 and thus integrate over 10 2 ‐10 4 years. mean and modal values are 0·42 (standard deviation: 0·29) and 0·2‐0·4 mm a −1 respectively, within the range of long-term average erosion rates in this area derived from apatite fission track thermochronology (0·1‐0·6 mm a −1 ). hence, our data do not record any significant variation in erosion rate over the last several million years. mean and modal short-term erosion rates for the andes are an order of magnitude lower than rates in the ganges river headwaters in the high himalaya and an order of magnitude greater than rates typical of the european alps. in the upper beni river region of the bolivian andes, short-term, basin-averaged erosion rates correlate with normalized channel steepness index, a metric of relative channel gradient corrected for drainage area. neither normalized channel steepness index nor basin-averaged erosion rate shows strong correlation with mean basin hillslope gradient or mean basin local relief because many hillslopes in the upper beni river region are at threshold values of slope and local relief. patterns of normalized channel steepness index appear primarily to reflect tectonic patterns and transient adjustment to those patterns by channel networks. climate and lithology do not appear to exert first-order controls on patterns of basin-averaged erosion rates in the bolivian andes. copyright © 2005 john wiley & sons, ltd.
investigating factors influencing consumer willingness to buy gm food and nano-food nanotechnology is increasingly being employed in the areas of food production and packaging. public perception will be crucial to the realization of these technological advances. we examined how lay people (n=153) perceive nanotechnology foods and nanotechnology food packaging, and we examined the factors that influence willingness to buy these products. participants received some general information about nanotechnology, and specific information about four nanotechnology applications. overall, participants were hesitant to buy nanotechnology foods or food with nanotechnology packaging. results suggest, however, that nanotechnology packaging is perceived as being more beneficial than nanotechnology foods. results further suggest that social trust in the food industry is an important factor directly influencing the affect evoked by these new products. as suggested by the affect heuristic, affect had an impact on perceived benefits and perceived risks. perceived benefit seems to be the most important predictor for willingness to buy.
robust stability criteria for takagi-sugeno fuzzy cohen-grossberg neural networks of neutral type abstract in this paper, by using topological degree theory and lyapunov–krasovskii function method, the problem of stability is investigated for a class of mixed-delayed cohen–grossberg neural networks with inverse lipschitz neuron activations and nonsmooth behaved functions. several novel delay-dependent sufficient conditions are established towards the existence, uniqueness and global exponential stability of the equilibrium point, which are shown in terms of linear matrix inequalities. besides, for the case of the activation function satisfying not only the inverse lipschitz conditions but also the lipschitz conditions, two criteria are derived by virtue of homeomorphism mapping principle, free-weighting matrix method and cauchy–schwarz inequality, which generalize some previous results. finally, two examples with their simulations are given to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.
cortical control of gait in healthy humans: an fmri study the abnormality of gait that may occur in patients with subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy (binswanger's disease) is described in 12 patients in whom difficulty walking was the presenting symptom. their gaits had elements of both parkinsonism and ataxia, which were most market in 4 patients unable to stand unaided. the difficulty in using their legs to walk was out of proportion to that of other movements of the lower limbs when lying or seated. in contrast, upper limb mobility and facial expression were relatively preserved. attention is drawn to the similarity of this gait pattern to that of some patients with hydrocephalus, frontal lobe lesions, and “senile” disorders of gait. a possible mechanism for this parkinsonian‐ataxia in these various conditions may be their propensity to damage the afferent and efferent interconnections of the leg areas of the motor and supplementary motor areas of the cerebral cortex with, the cerebellum and basal ganglia.
postural stability of patients with schizophrenia during challenging sensory conditions: implication of sensory integration for postural control objectiveto examine prevalence of movement disorders (mds) such as tardive dyskinesia (td), parkinsonism or akathisia in an adolescent population with schizophrenia and in relationship to predominantly atypical antipsychotic treatment.methodninety-three patients (aged 19.6±2.2 years) were ascertained in this cross-sectional/retrospective study. 76 patients (81.7%) received atypical, 10 (10.8%) typical antipsychotics and 7 (7.5%) combinations of atypical/typical antipsychotics. md symptoms were assessed using tardive dyskinesia rating scale (tdrs), abnormal involuntary movement scale (aims), extrapyramidal symptom scale (eps), barnes akathisia scale (bas).resultsmovement disorder symptoms were found in 37 patients (39.8%) fulfilling strict/subthreshold criteria for td (5.4/11.8%), parkinsonism (2.2/25.8%) or akathisia (1.1/11.8%), respectively. patients treated with typical antipsychotics displayed a significantly higher eps-score (p=0.036) and a tendency towards a higher bas-score (p=0.061) compared to patients with atypical antipsychotics. treatment durations with typical/atypical antipsychotics showed trends towards advantages of atypical antipsychotics with regard to parkinsonism/akathisia symptoms (p=0.061; p=0.054), but not with regard to td symptoms (p=0.003), possibly due to confounding effects.conclusionunder treatment with atypical antipsychotics md symptoms are less prevalent and less pronounced than under typical antipsychotics. we speculate that the finding of relatively high prevalence rates of subthreshold md symptoms may be, at least partially, explained by previous or combined therapy with typical antipsychotics.

single-photon techniques for standard cmos digital ics photon counting is useful in space-based imagers wherever quantitative light-intensity evaluation is necessary. various types of radiation, from cosmic rays to high-energy proton beams to gamma radiation, have an effect on the functionality and accuracy of imagers and the literature is extensive [1,2]. techniques to maximize sensor tolerance have also been developed for a number of years and several imagers resistant to up to 30mrad (si) of gamma radiation have been reported. these sensors have several shortcomings: either significant noise performance degradation, up to several orders of magnitude [2], or unacceptably high pre-radiation noise levels [3]. in addition, many radiation-tolerant sensors use dedicated processes, thus possibly limiting their suitability for mass-market applications [4].
a case of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy without arrhythmias arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (arvc/d) is a heart muscle disease clinically characterized by life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. its prevalence has been estimated to vary from 1:2,500 to 1:5,000. arvc/d is a major cause of sudden death in the young and athletes. the pathology consists of a genetically determined dystrophy of the right ventricular myocardium with fibro-fatty replacement to such an extent that it leads to right ventricular aneurysms. the clinical picture may include: a subclinical phase without symptoms and with ventricular fibrillation being the first presentation; an electrical disorder with palpitations and syncope, due to tachyarrhythmias of right ventricular origin; right ventricular or biventricular pump failure, so severe as to require transplantation. the causative genes encode proteins of mechanical cell junctions (plakoglobin, plakophilin, desmoglein, desmocollin, desmoplakin) and account for intercalated disk remodeling. familiar occurrence with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and variable penetrance has been proven. recessive variants associated with palmoplantar keratoderma and woolly hair have been also reported. clinical diagnosis may be achieved by demonstrating functional and structural alterations of the right ventricle, depolarization and repolarization abnormalities, arrhythmias with the left bundle branch block morphology and fibro-fatty replacement through endomyocardial biopsy. two dimensional echo, angiography and magnetic resonance are the imaging tools for visualizing structural-functional abnormalities. electroanatomic mapping is able to detect areas of low voltage corresponding to myocardial atrophy with fibro-fatty replacement. the main differential diagnoses are idiopathic right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia, myocarditis, dialted cardiomyopathy and sarcoidosis. only palliative therapy is available and consists of antiarrhythmic drugs, catheter ablation and implantable cardioverter defibrillator. young age, family history of juvenile sudden death, qrs dispersion ≥ 40 ms, t-wave inversion, left ventricular involvement, ventricular tachycardia, syncope and previous cardiac arrest are the major risk factors for adverse prognosis. preparticipation screening for sport eligibility has been proven to be effective in detecting asymptomatic patients and sport disqualification has been life-saving, substantially declining sudden death in young athletes.
path planning for a mobile robot in a dynamic environment path planning for mobile robots is an important topic in modern robotics studies. this paper proposes a new approach to collision-free path planning problem for mobile robots using the particle swarm optimization combined with chaos iterations. the particle swarm optimization algorithm is run to get the global best particle as the candidate solution, and then local chaotic search iterations are employed to improve the solution precision. the effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by three simulation examples.
patterns of care and outcomes of adjuvant radiotherapy for meningiomas: a surveillance, epidemiology, and end results and medicare linked analysis objectiveatypical meningioma (am) patients often undergo gross total resection (gtr) at the time of presentation, but subsequent prognosis and optimal management remain unclear. we sought to define the long-term recurrence rate of ams after gtr, along with factors predicting recurrence, including postoperative radiation. methodswe performed a retrospective review of 108 ams after gtr at our institution from 1993 to 2004. recurrence risk factors were analyzed using multivariate cox regression. resultsthere were 600 patient-years of imaging follow-up on 48 men and 60 women. of 108 tumors, 30 (28%) recurred 3 to 144 months after gtr (mean, 36 months). actuarial tumor recurrence rates were 7% (1 year), 41% (5 years), and 48% (10 years). of 108 patients, 8 received postoperative radiation without recurrence (p = 0.1). multivariate analysis including age, sex, postoperative radiation, tumor location, mib-1 labeling index, and 6 atypical-defining histological features identified recurrence-predicting factors: older age (hazard ratio, 1.6/decade; p = 0.01), sheeting (hazard ratio, 2.2; p = 0.025), and prominent nucleoli (hazard ratio, 2.1; p = 0.034). recursive partitioning identified a subset, men with mitoses and prominent nucleoli, with 70% recurrence (n = 14). all patients with recurrences received radiation, and 22 of 30 patients underwent craniotomies (average, 2.7 craniotomies per patient with recurrence; range, 1–7 craniotomies). only 1 of 22 re-resected meningiomas underwent malignant transformation. of 30 patients with recurrence, 10 experienced tumor-induced mortality an average of 7 years after recurrence (range, 1–14 years). conclusionafter gtr without postoperative radiation, ams have a high recurrence rate. most recurrences occurred within 5 years after resection. recurrences caused numerous reoperations per patient and shortened survival. our finding suggesting lower recurrence rates in patients undergoing immediate postoperative radiation should be investigated in larger, prospective series.
discriminative paired dictionary learning for visual recognition dictionary learning (dl) for sparse coding has shown promising results in classification tasks, while how to adaptively build the relationship between dictionary atoms and class labels is still an important open question. the existing dictionary learning approaches simply fix a dictionary atom to be either class-specific or shared by all classes beforehand, ignoring that the relationship needs to be updated during dl. to address this issue, in this paper we propose a novel latent dictionary learning (ldl) method to learn a discriminative dictionary and build its relationship to class labels adaptively. each dictionary atom is jointly learned with a latent vector, which associates this atom to the representation of different classes. more specifically, we introduce a latent representation model, in which discrimination of the learned dictionary is exploited via minimizing the within-class scatter of coding coefficients and the latent-value weighted dictionary coherence. the optimal solution is efficiently obtained by the proposed solving algorithm. correspondingly, a latent sparse representation based classifier is also presented. experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms many recently proposed sparse representation and dictionary learning approaches for action, gender and face recognition.
prognosis among survivors of primary ventricular fibrillation in the percutaneous coronary intervention era. background limited population-based data are available that describe temporal and recent trends in the incidence and case-fatality rates in patients with primary ventricular fibrillation (vf) complicating acute myocardial infarction (ami). the purpose of this study was to describe changes over a 22-year period (1975 through 1997) in the incidence and hospital case-fatality rates of primary vf complicating ami from a multihospital, community-wide perspective.   methods and results this was an observational study of metropolitan worcester residents hospitalized with a validated uncomplicated ami (n = 5020) in all hospitals in the worcester, massachusetts, metropolitan area (1990 census population = 437,000) during 11 1-year periods between 1975 and 1997. the overall incidence rate of primary vf complicating ami was 4.7%. the crude as well as multivariable adjusted odds of the development of vf did not change significantly over the 22-year period under study. the overall in-hospital case-fatality rate of patients with primary vf was 44%, which was significantly greater in comparison with ami patients in whom vf did not develop (5%). hospital mortality rates associated with primary vf declined over time. improved survival was observed in patients who had primary vf in the 1990s after adjusting for potential prognostic confounders.   conclusions the results of this community-wide study failed to indicate changes over time in the incidence rates of primary vf in patients hospitalized with ami between 1975 and 1997. on the other hand, hospital death rates in patients with primary vf have shown encouraging declines during more recent periods. these mortality trends are likely to be the results of improvements in the treatment and more careful surveillance of patients with ami.
the ethics of community-based research with people who use drugs: results of a scoping review substance-using women who exchange sex for money, drugs or shelter as a means of basic subsistence (ie. survival sex) have remained largely at the periphery of hiv and harm reduction policies and services across canadian cities. this is notwithstanding global evidence of the multiple harms faced by this population, including high rates of violence and poverty, and enhanced vulnerabilities to hiv transmission among women who smoke or inject drugs. in response, a participatory-action research project was developed in partnership with a local sex work agency to examine the hiv-related vulnerabilities, barriers to accessing care, and impact of current prevention and harm reduction strategies among women in survival sex work. this paper provides a brief background of the health and drug-related harms among substance-using women in survival sex work, and outlines the development and methodology of a community-based hiv prevention research project partnership. in doing so, we discuss some of the strengths and challenges of community-based hiv prevention research, as well as some key ethical considerations, in the context of street-level sex work in an urban setting.
establishing a time-scale for plant evolution. archaefructaceae is proposed as a new basal angiosperm family of herbaceous aquatic plants. this family consists of the fossilsarchaefructus liaoningensis and a.sinensis sp. nov. complete plants from roots to fertile shoots are known. their age is a minimum of 124.6 million years from the yixian formation, liaoning, china. they are a sister clade to all angiosperms when their characters are included in a combined three-gene molecular and morphological analysis. their reproductive axes lack petals and sepals and bear stamens in pairs below conduplicate carpels.
ibuprofen inhibits migration and proliferation of human coronary artery smooth muscle cells by inducing a differentiated phenotype: role of peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor γ the peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor‐γ (ppar‐γ) is constitutively expressed in primary cultures of rat microglia, the main population of brain resident macrophages, and its ligand‐dependent activation leads to the repression of several microglial functions. a few non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (nsaids), e.g. indomethacin and ibuprofen, show ppar‐γ agonistic properties. it has been proposed that ppar‐γ activation contributes to the potential benefits of the long‐term use of certain nsaids in delaying the progression of alzheimer's disease (ad). previous data have shown that the nsaid hct1026 [2‐fluoro‐α‐methyl(1,1′‐biphenyl)4‐acetic acid‐4‐(nitrooxy)butyl ester], a derivative of flurbiprofen which releases nitric oxide (no), reduces the number of reactive microglial cells in a variety of models. this evidence together with the chemical analogy with ibuprofen led us to investigate whether flurbiprofen and hct1026 interact with ppar‐γ and interfere with microglial activation. we found that a low concentration (1 µm) of hct1026, but not flurbiprofen, activated ppar‐γ in primary cultures of rat microglia, with kinetics similar to those of the synthetic agonist ciglitazone. the ppar‐γ antagonist gw9662 (2‐chloro‐5‐nitrobenzanilide) prevented the activation of ppar‐γ by hct1026. interestingly, unlike other nsaids that activate ppar‐γ at concentrations higher than those required for cyclooxygenase inhibition, hct1026 activated ppar‐γ and inhibited prostaglandin e2 synthesis at the same low concentration (1 µm). the results suggest that hct1026 may exert additional anti‐inflammatory actions through ppar‐γ activation, allowing a more effective control of microglial activation and brain inflammation.
tumors skew endothelial cells to disrupt nk cell, t-cell and macrophage functions tumor-associated macrophages (tam) represent the major inflammatory component of the stroma of many tumors, able to affect different aspects of the neoplastic tissue. many observations indicate that tam express several m2-associated protumoral functions, including promotion of angiogenesis, matrix remodelling and suppression of adaptive immunity. the protumoral role of tam in cancer is further supported by clinical studies that found a correlation between the high macrophage content of tumors and poor patient prognosis and by evidence showing that long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduces the risk of several cancers. here, we discuss evidence supporting the view that tam represent a unique and distinct m2-skewed myeloid population and a potential target of anti-cancer therapy.
maternal treatment with dexamethasone during gestation alters sexual development markers in the f1 and f2 male offspring of wistar rats. unlabelled we studied the effects of chronic renal failure on the pituitary-cortisol axis and adrenal androgen function in 26 patients (16 male and 10 female), aged 6.5 to 22.5 years (mean 14.5). ten patients were prepubertal, 8 pubertal, and 8 post-pubertal. all of them were on chronic hemodialysis. pubic hair development was delayed in 56% of the patients. serum cortisol was increased in 15 out of the 26 patients. serum delta 4-androstenedione was high in 11 out of 15 patients in tanner's stage i or ii and in 1 out of 11 patients in tanner's stage iii, iv or v (p less than 0.01). serum cortisol was elevated in 10 out of 12 patients with high serum delta 4-androstenedione and in only 5 out of 14 with normal delta 4-androstenedione (p less than 0.02). serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate was normal in 22 patients and elevated in 4 males. there was a significant inverse correlation between bone age and serum cortisol (r: -0.59; p less than 0.005) and a significant positive correlation between bone age and serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (r: 0.45 p less than 0.01). serum acth was normal. a reduction by 50% in cortisol and 78% in dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate was found after dexamethasone suppression, but delta 4-androstenedione did not suppress after dexamethasone. after acth stimulation test cortisol increased by 50% and delta 4-androstenedione by 80%.   conclusions the increased levels of cortisol and delta 4-androstenedione with partial resistance to dexamethasone suggest that these patients have a hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction similar to that found in cushing's disease or in chronic stress. the difference in the responses of delta 4-androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate observed is consistent with the existence of different mechanisms of control for these two steroids.
evidence that fibroblasts derive from epithelium during tissue fibrosis. progressive tissue fibrosis can compromise epithelial function resulting in organ failure. appreciating evidence suggests that fibroblasts provide fibrogenic collagens during such injury. we further tested this notion by attempting to reduce the physiologic consequences of organ fibrosis through the selective killing of fibroblasts at sites of injury. here, we report the conditional reduction of tissue fibroblasts using the coding sequence for herpesvirus thymidine kinase (deltatk) put under the control of a cell-specific promoter from the gene encoding fibroblast-specific protein 1 (fsp1). transgenic fibroblasts from mice carrying fsp1.deltatk minigenes expressed thymidine kinase concordantly with native fsp1 and, compared to transgenic epithelium, were selectively susceptible to the lethal effects of nucleoside analogs either in culture or during experimental renal fibrosis. the numbers of fibroblasts in fibrogenic kidney tissue were reduced on exposure to nucleoside analogs as was the degree of type i collagen deposition and the extent of fibrosis. fibroblast reduction following the stress of dna chain termination highlights the important contribution of cell division during fibrogenesis. our findings convey a proof of principle regarding the importance of fsp1(+) fibroblasts in fibrosis as well as providing a new approach to treating the relentless scarification of tissue.
targeted degradation of pseudo-response regulator5 by an scfztl complex regulates clock function and photomorphogenesis in arabidopsis thaliana[w] in arabidopsis thaliana, the transcripts of the aprr1/toc1 family genes each start accumulating after dawn rhythmically and one after another at intervals in the order of aprr9-->aprr7-->aprr5-->aprr3-->aprr1/toc1 under continuous light. except for the well-characterized aprr1/toc1, however, no evidence has been provided that other aprr1/toc1 family genes are indeed implicated in the mechanisms underlying circadian rhythms. we here attempted to provide such evidence by characterizing transgenic plants that constitutively express the aprr5 gene. the resulting aprr5-overexpressing (aprr5-ox) plants showed intriguing properties with regard to not only circadian rhythms, but also control of flowering time and light response. first, the aberrant expression of aprr5 in such transgenic plants resulted in a characteristic phenotype with regard to transcriptional events, in which free-running rhythms were considerably altered for certain circadian-regulated genes, including cca1, lhy, aprr1/toc1, other aprr1/toc1 members, gi and cab2, although each rhythm was clearly sustained even after plants were transferred to continuous light. with regard to biological events, aprr5-ox plants flowered much earlier than wild-type plants, more or less, in a manner independent of photoperiodicity (or under short-day conditions). furthermore, aprr5-ox plants showed an srl (short-hypocotyls under red light) phenotype that is indicative of hypersensitiveness to red light in early photomorphogenesis. both aprr1-ox and aprr9-ox plants also showed the same phenotype. therefore, aprr5 (together with aprr1/toc1 and aprr9) must be taken into consideration for a better understanding of the molecular links between circadian rhythms, control of flowering time through the photoperiodic long-day pathway, and also light signaling-controlled plant development.
use of health information technology to advance evidence-based care: lessons from the va queri program objectives to document and assess the experiences of 104 agency for healthcare research and quality (ahrq)-funded health information technology (health it) grantees in planning and implementing health it systems.   data source grant proposals and interviews with the ahrq health it grantees.   data collection method extracted descriptive data from the health it grant proposals; conducted telephone interviews with principal investigators.   principal findings ahrq funding of the health it projects provided important support for health it development work in various health care settings. successful implementation required commitment from top management, dedicated staff and financial resources, an open process to encourage buy-in and enthusiasm by end users, and sheer persistence. technologies required tailoring to the specific organization's needs. grantees felt their projects could be replicated by others, if organizations had ample it expertise and resources. evaluating the value of health it was hampered by the absence of validated instruments and measures, organizational demands that competed with data collection, and lack of evaluation expertise among health it implementers.   conclusions experiences of the health it grantees provide rich information for use by health care providers, ahrq, and other policy makers to help strengthen future health it development efforts, including the need to improve evaluation design and standards to assess impact.
a framework for recognizing the simultaneous aspects of american sign language in this paper we present a novel approach to continuous, whole-sentence asl recognition that uses phonemes instead of whole signs as the basic units. our approach is based on a sequential phonological model of asl. according to this model the asl signs can be broken into movements and holds, which are both considered phonemes.this model does away with the distinction between whole signs and epenthesis movements that we made in previous work [17]. instead, epenthesis movements are just like the other movements that constitute the signs.we subsequently train hidden markov models (hmms) to recognize the phonemes, instead of whole signs and epenthesis movements that we recognized previously [17]. because the number of phonemes is limited, hmm-based training and recognition of the asl signal becomes computationally more tractable and has the potential to lead to the recognition of large-scale vocabularies.we experimented with a 22 word vocabulary, and we achieved similar recognition rates with phoneme-and word-based approaches. this result is very promising for scaling the task in the future.
n‐ and c‐terminal degradation of ecdysteroid receptor isoforms, when transiently expressed in mammalian cho cells, is regulated by the proteasome and cysteine and threonine proteases backgroundmetamorphosis is a complex, highly conserved and strictly regulated development process that involves the programmed cell death of obsolete larval organs. here we show a novel functional role for the aspartic proteinase cathepsin d during insect metamorphosis.resultscathepsin d of the silkworm bombyx mori (bmcatd) was ecdysone-induced, differentially and spatially expressed in the larval fat body of the final instar and in the larval gut of pupal stage, and its expression led to programmed cell death. furthermore, bmcatd was highly induced in the fat body of baculovirus-infected b. mori larvae, suggesting that this gene is involved in the induction of metamorphosis of host insects infected with baculovirus. rna interference (rnai)-mediated bmcatd knock-down inhibited programmed cell death of the larval fat body, resulting in the arrest of larval-pupal transformation. bmcatd rnai also inhibited the programmed cell death of larval gut during pupal stage.conclusionbased on these results, we concluded that bmcatd is critically involved in the programmed cell death of the larval fat body and larval gut in silkworm metamorphosis.
comparison between overground and dynamometer manual wheelchair propulsion. objective to investigate pushrim forces and joint kinetics during wheelchair propulsion and to discuss the differences between inexperienced and experienced wheelchair users.   design cohort study.   setting human engineering laboratory at a state university.   subjects four men who use manual wheelchairs for mobility and four nondisabled men who did not have extensive experience pushing a wheelchair; all subjects were asymptomatic for upper extremity pain or injury.   methods subjects pushed a commonly used wheelchair fitted with a force-sensing pushrim on a stationary wheelchair dynamometer. video and force data were collected for 5 strokes at one speed of propulsion. pushrim forces and net joint forces and moments were analyzed.   main outcome measures pushrim forces, radial (fr) and tangential (ft), were analyzed and compared for both groups in relation to peak values and time to peak values and as ratios of overall forces generated. net joint forces and moments were analyzed in a similar fashion.   results pushrim forces and joint moments were similar to those previously reported, with radial forces averaging between 34 and 39n and tangential forces ranging on average between 66 and 95n. tangential forces were higher than radial forces, and mean ratios of tangential forces to the resultant force were approximately 75%, whereas mean radial force ratios were approximately 22%. all subjects showed higher joint moments at the shoulder than at the elbow or wrist. a large component of vertical reaction force was seen at the shoulder. significant differences (p < .05) were found between groups for peak tangential force and time to peak tangential and peak vertical forces, with wheelchair users having lower values and longer times to reach the peak values.   conclusions discrete variables from the force-time curves can be used to distinguish between wheelchair users and nonusers. the experienced users tended to push longer, used forces with lower peaks, and took longer time to reach peak values. this propulsive pattern may have been developed to reduce the chance of injury by minimizing the forces at the joints, as a means of maximizing efficiency or as a combination of these factors. more work investigating 3-dimensional forces and the influence of seating position and various conditions of propulsion such as speed changes, ramps, and directional changes on injury mechanisms needs to be completed.
gene duplications in prokaryotes can be associated with environmental adaptation abstract fuel oxygenates such as methyl and ethyl tert-butyl ether (mtbe and etbe, respectively) are degraded only by a limited number of bacterial strains. the aerobic pathway is generally thought to run via tert-butyl alcohol (tba) and 2-hydroxyisobutyrate (2-hiba), whereas further steps are unclear. we have now demonstrated for the newly isolated β-proteobacterial strains l108 and l10, as well as for the closely related strain cip i-2052, that 2-hiba was degraded by a cobalamin-dependent enzymatic step. in these strains, growth on substrates containing the tert-butyl moiety, such as mtbe, tba, and 2-hiba, was strictly dependent on cobalt, which could be replaced by cobalamin. tandem mass spectrometry identified a 2-hiba-induced protein with high similarity to a peptide whose gene sequence was found in the finished genome of the mtbe-degrading strain methylibium petroleiphilum pm1. alignment analysis identified it as the small subunit of isobutyryl-coenzyme a (coa) mutase (icm; ec 5.4.99.13), which is a cobalamin-containing carbon skeleton-rearranging enzyme, originally described only in streptomyces spp. sequencing of the genes of both icm subunits from strain l108 revealed nearly 100% identity with the corresponding peptide sequences from m. petroleiphilum pm1, suggesting a horizontal gene transfer event to have occurred between these strains. enzyme activity was demonstrated in crude extracts of induced cells of strains l108 and l10, transforming 2-hiba into 3-hydroxybutyrate in the presence of coa and atp. the physiological and evolutionary aspects of this novel pathway involved in mtbe and etbe metabolism are discussed.
titan cell production in cryptococcus neoformans reshapes the cell wall and capsule composition during infection the pathogenesis of cryptococcus neoformans infection has been studied extensively with respect to inflammatory and pathological changes, but very little information is available regarding the morphology of yeast cells during the course of infection. electron microscopy of cryptococcus neoformans in murine pulmonary infection revealed increased cell wall thickness with time, but this difference was only partially accounted for by increases in cell diameter. cell walls of melanized cells were thicker than those of nonmelanized cells 2 h after infection, and the cell wall of yeast became blacker with time, suggesting that melanization contributes to the increased cell wall thickness. heterogeneous cell populations emerged, with the appearance of giant forms. while for c. neoformans atcc strain 24067 (serotype d) the full spectrum of cell sizes were observed, for strains h99 (serotype a) and 3501 (serotype d) cells were divisible into two populations, giant and micro forms. in contrast to cellular heterogeneity, the epitope recognized by a protective mab on the capsular glucuronoxylomannan (gxm) was found at all times of infection. immunoelectron microscopy using mabs to gxm demonstrated reactivity with intracellular structures, suggesting that synthesis of capsular polysaccharide occurs, at least in part, in the cytoplasm. in summary, the results indicate that: (i) the infection is dynamic with respect to yeast cell morphology; (ii) giant cell forms arise in tissue during the course of infection; (iii) cell walls blacken and thicken during the course of infection, consistent with melanin synthesis during infection; and (iv) gxm epitopes are found in the capsule, cell wall and cytoplasm, consistent with intracellular polysaccharide synthesis. the results indicate that the population of c. neoformans cells in tissue is in a highly dynamic state, implying that the immune system must confront cells with varying characteristics during the course of infection.
chemical analyses and in vitro and in vivo toxicity of fruit methanol extract of sechium edule var. nigrum spinosum a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (lc-ms)-based method was developed for the characterization of flavonoids from sechium edule (jacq) swartz (cucurbitaceae) edible organs, a plant cultivated since pre-colombian times in mexico where the fruit is called chayote. chayote is used for human consumption in many countries; in addition to the fruits, stems, leaves and the tuberous part of the roots are also eaten. eight flavonoids, including three c-glycosyl and five o-glycosyl flavones, were detected, characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic data, and quantified in roots, leaves, stems, and fruits of the plant by lc-photodiode array-ms. the aglycone moieties are represented by apigenin and luteolin, while the sugar units are glucose, apiose, and rhamnose. the results indicated that the highest total amount of flavonoids was in the leaves (35.0 mg/10 g of dried part), followed by roots (30.5 mg/10 g), and finally by stems (19.3 mg/10 g).
artificial reefs for sea cucumber aquaculture confirmed as settlement substrates of the moon jellyfish aurelia coerulea jellyfish (cnidaria, scyphozoa) blooms appear to be increasing in both intensity and frequency in many coastal areas worldwide, due to multiple hypothesized anthropogenic stressors. here, we propose that the proliferation of artificial structures – associated with (1) the exponential growth in shipping, aquaculture, and other coastal industries, and (2) coastal protection (collectively, “ocean sprawl”) – provides habitat for jellyfish polyps and may be an important driver of the global increase in jellyfish blooms. however, the habitat of the benthic polyps that commonly result in coastal jellyfish blooms has remained elusive, limiting our understanding of the drivers of these blooms. support for the hypothesized role of ocean sprawl in promoting jellyfish blooms is provided by observations and experimental evidence demonstrating that jellyfish larvae settle in large numbers on artificial structures in coastal waters and develop into dense concentrations of jellyfish-producing polyps.
is the ecura system useful for selecting patients who require radical surgery after noncurative endoscopic submucosal dissection for early gastric cancer? a comparative study backgroundalthough radical surgery is routinely performed for patients who do not meet the curative criteria for endoscopic submucosal dissection (esd) for early gastric cancer (egc) due to the risk of lymph node metastasis (lnm), this standard therapeutic option may be excessive given the lower number of patients with lnm. therefore, we aimed to investigate long-term outcomes and validate risk factors predicting recurrence after esd.methodsof 15,785 patients who underwent esd for egc at 19 institutions between 2000 and 2011, 1969 patients not meeting the curative criteria were included in this multi-center study. based on the treatment strategy after esd, patients were divided into radical surgery (n = 1064) and follow-up (no additional treatment, n = 905) groups.resultsoverall survival (os) and disease-specific survival (dss) were significantly higher in the radical surgery group than in the follow-up group (p < 0.001 and p = 0.012, respectively). however, the difference in 3-year dss between the groups (99.4 vs. 98.7 %) was rather small compared with the difference in 3-year os (96.7 vs. 84.0 %). lnm was found in 89 patients (8.4 %) in the radical surgery group. lymphatic invasion was found to be an independent risk factor for recurrence in the follow-up group (hazard ratio 5.23; 95 % confidence interval 2.01–13.6; p = 0.001).conclusionsthis multi-center study, representing the largest cohort to date, revealed a large discrepancy between os and dss in the two groups. since follow-up with no additional treatment after esd may be an acceptable option for patients at low risk, further risk stratification is needed for appropriate individualized treatment strategies.
inter-individual differences in decision-making, flexible and goal-directed behaviors: novel insights within the prefronto-striatal networks there has been nearly a century of interest in the idea that encoding and storage of information in the brain requires changes in the efficacy of synaptic connections between neurons that are activated during learning. recent research into the molecular mechanisms of long-term potentiation (ltp) has brought about new knowledge that has provided valuable insights into the neural mechanisms of memory storage. the evidence indicates that rapid activation of the genetic machinery can be a key mechanism underlying the enduring modification of neural networks required for the stability of memories. in recent years, a wealth of experimental data has highlighted the importance of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (mapk/erk) signalling in the regulation of gene transcription in neurons. here, we briefly review experiments that have shown mapk/erk, camp response element-binding protein (creb) and the immediate early gene (ieg) zif268 are essential components of a signalling cascade required for the expression of late phase ltp and of certain forms of long-term memory. we also present experiments in which we have assessed the role of these three molecules in recognition memory. we show that pharmacological blockade of mapk/erk phosphorylation, functional inactivation of creb in an inducible transgenic mouse and inactivation of zif268 in a mutant mouse result in a similar deficit in long-term recognition memory. in the continuing debate about the role of ltp mechanisms in memory, these findings provide an important complement to the suggestion that synaptic changes brought about by ltp and memory consolidation and storage share, at least in part, common underlying molecular mechanisms.
macular pigment density changes in japanese individuals supplemented with lutein or zeaxanthin: quantification via resonance raman spectrophotometry and autofluorescence imaging age-related macular degeneration (amd) is thought to be the result of a lifetime of oxidative insult that results in photoreceptor death within the macula. increased risk of amd may result from low levels of lutein and zeaxanthin (macular pigment) in the diet, serum or retina, and excessive exposure to blue light. through its light-screening capacity and antioxidant activity, macular pigment may reduce photooxidation in the central retina. lutein supplements, at 30 mg/d, were shown previously to increase serum lutein and macular pigment density in two subjects. in this study, we compared the effects of a range of lutein doses (2.4- 30 mg/d), as well as a high zeaxanthin dose (30 mg/d), on the serum and macular pigment in a series of experiments. serum carotenoids were quantified by hplc. macular pigment densities were determined psychophysically. serum lutein concentrations in each subject reached a plateau that was correlated with the dose (r = 0.82, p < 0.001). plateau concentrations ranged from 2.8 x 10(-7) to 2.7 x 10(-6) mol/l. zeaxanthin was less well absorbed than an equal lutein dose, resulting in plateaus of approximately 5 x 10(-7) mol/l. the rate of increase in macular pigment optical density was correlated with the plateau concentration of carotenoids in the serum (r = 0.58, p < 0.001), but not with the presupplementation optical density (r = 0.13, p = 0.21). the mean rate of increase was (3.42 +/- 0.80) x 10(5) mau/d per unit concentration (mol/l) of carotenoids in the serum. it remains to be demonstrated whether lutein or zeaxanthin dietary supplements reduce the incidence of amd.
investigating factors influencing consumer willingness to buy gm food and nano-food nanotechnology is increasingly being employed in the areas of food production and packaging. public perception will be crucial to the realization of these technological advances. we examined how lay people (n=153) perceive nanotechnology foods and nanotechnology food packaging, and we examined the factors that influence willingness to buy these products. participants received some general information about nanotechnology, and specific information about four nanotechnology applications. overall, participants were hesitant to buy nanotechnology foods or food with nanotechnology packaging. results suggest, however, that nanotechnology packaging is perceived as being more beneficial than nanotechnology foods. results further suggest that social trust in the food industry is an important factor directly influencing the affect evoked by these new products. as suggested by the affect heuristic, affect had an impact on perceived benefits and perceived risks. perceived benefit seems to be the most important predictor for willingness to buy.
dopamine modulates persistent synaptic activity and enhances the signal-to-noise ratio in the prefrontal cortex a large body of phenomenological evidence implicates abnormal connectivity of brain macrocircuitry and microcircuitry in schizophrenia. recent discoveries of susceptibility genes for schizophrenia have zeroed in on the synaptic signaling machinery of cortical microcircuits as fundamental to disease causation and have militated for further revision of the role of dopamine in this illness. dopamine, long implicated in psychosis and in antipsychotic drug effects, is crucial in optimizing signal-to-noise ratio of local cortical microcircuits. this action of dopamine is achieved principally by d1- and d2-receptor-mediated effects on pyramidal and local circuit neurons, which mediate neuronal excitability and recurrent inhibition and thus contribute to the stability of cortical representations of external and internal stimuli. in schizophrenia, an abnormal cortical dopamine d1/d2 activation ratio - in concert with, and in part related to, altered gaba and glutamate transmission - appears to interfere crucially with this process.
application of constructed wetlands for treating agricultural runoff and agro-industrial wastewater: a review subsurface horizontal flow reed beds are being evaluated for nitrogen (n) and phosphorus (p) removal from plant nursery runoff water in new south wales australia. the need to include plants (phragmites australis), the effect of reaction time (3.5 v 7.0 d) and dissolved organic carbon (doc) on n and p removal in batch fed gravel wetland tubs (55 l) was studied over 19 months. simulated nursery runoff water containing n (10.1 mg l(-1), 74% as no3) and p (0.58 mg l(-1), 88% as po4) and doc (2-5 mg l(-1)) was used. the planted wetland tubs removed >96% tn and tp over most of the 19-month study period while unplanted tubs were inefficient (<16% n and <45% p removal) and occasionally discharged nutrients. doubling the reaction time to 7.0 days had no effect on nutrient removal. plant nutrient uptake accounted for most of the n (76%) and p (86%) removed while roots and rhizomes were the dominant sink (n 58%, p 67%). the addition of methanol (c:n-3:1) to unplanted tubs achieved 81-98% n removal. in carbon limited low nutrient nursery runoff, plants were essential to a gravel-based wetland to achieve efficient nutrient removal with effluent tn and tp concentrations of <1 mg l(-1) and 0.05 mg l(-1), respectively with a 3.5 day reaction time.
co-expression of two sugar transporters in primary and lateral roots of etiolated glycine max seedlings* the transporters responsible for sugar uptake into non-photosynthetic sink tissues in plants, such as roots and flowers, have not been fully identified and analyzed. plants encode around 100 putative sugar transporters within the major facilitator superfamily, yet only a few have been studied. here we report the analysis of a sugar alcohol permease homolog (atplt5, at3g18830) from arabidopsis. a wide range of sugars including hexoses, pentoses, tetroses, a sugar acid, and sugar alcohols but not disaccharides induced inward currents in oocytes expressing atplt5. atplt5 expression also resulted in 14c-labeled substrate uptake in oocytes, indicating that atplt5 encodes an ion-coupled uptake transporter. k0.5 values for glucose and sorbitol were highly dependent on external ph. expression of atplt5 was found primarily in sink tissues: in the elongation zone of roots, in the inflorescence stem, and several floral structures, especially in the floral abscission zone. expression was induced by mechanical wounding and insect feeding. analysis of transport properties and expression in arabidopsis indicate that atplt5 functions to transport a wide range of sugars into specific sink tissues in the plant.
pediatric deep brain stimulation using awake recording and stimulation for target selection in an inpatient neuromodulation monitoring unit deep brain stimulation (dbs) has become a mainstay of dystonia management in adulthood. typically targeting electrode placement in the gpi, sustained improvement in dystonic symptoms are anticipated in adults with isolated genetic dystonias. dystonia in childhood is more commonly a symptomatic condition, with dystonia frequently expressed on the background of a structurally abnormal brain. outcomes following dbs in this setting are much more variable, the reasons for which have yet to be elucidated. much of the focus on improving outcomes following dbs in dystonia management has been on the importance of patient selection, with, until recently, little discussion of the choice of target. in this review, we advance the argument that patient selection for dbs in childhood cannot be made separate from the choice of target nuclei. the anatomy of common dbs targets is considered, and factors influencing their choice for electrode insertion are discussed. we propose an "abc" for dbs in childhood dystonia is proposed: appropriate child selected; best nuclei chosen for electrode insertion; correct position within that nucleus.
text mining and natural language processing approaches for automatic categorization of lay requests to web-based expert forums background the internet is increasingly used for health matters including ask the doctor services.   aim to describe users and usage pattern of text-based medical consultation with family physicians on the internet.   methods descriptive analysis of the first 4 years' use of a swedish ask the doctor service concerning number of inquiries, age and gender of inquirers. time of day and week, types of medical inquiries, and use in relation to population density was analyzed during the last year of the study.   results we found a considerable number of users, with 38,217 inquiries submitted to the service. three-fourths of the inquirers were women, thus exceeding the gender difference seen in regular health care. the typical user was a woman aged 21-60 years. the service was used any time day or night, 7 days a week. almost half of the inquiries were submitted during evenings and nights. most areas of medicine were represented in the inquiries, reflecting the fact that there was no control of what an inquiry should include. the use was widespread over the country but more frequent per capita in more densely populated areas as defined by postal code.   conclusion in the study of a service for text-based consultations with family physicians on the internet, we found a geographically widely distributed use, slowly but gradually increasing during a 4-year period. the use increased more rapidly among young and middle-aged women. asynchronous text-based consultation is likely to expand in the near future.
prevalence and correlates of probable common mental disorders in a population with high prevalence of hiv in zimbabwe backgroundprevention of mother-to-child transmission of hiv (pmtct) is a major public health challenge in zimbabwe.methodsusing trained peer counselors, a nevirapine (nvp)-based pmtct program was implemented as part of routine care in urban antenatal clinics.resultsbetween october 2002 and december 2004, a total of 19,279 women presented for antenatal care. of these, 18,817 (98%) underwent pre-test counseling; 10,513 (56%) accepted hiv testing, of whom 1986 (19%) were hiv-infected. overall, 9696 (92%) of women collected results and received individual post-test counseling. only 288 men opted for hiv testing. of the 1807 hiv-infected women who received posttest counseling, 1387 (77%) collected nvp tablet and 727 (40%) delivered at the clinics. of the 1986 hiv-infected women, 691 (35%) received nvpsd at onset of labor, and 615 (31%) infants received nvpsd. of the 727 hiv-infected women who delivered in the clinics, only 396 women returned to the clinic with their infants for the 6-week follow-up visit; of these mothers, 258 (59%) joined support groups and 234 (53%) opted for contraception. by the end of the study period, 209 (53%) of mother-infant pairs (n = 396) came to the clinic for at least 3 follow-up visits.conclusiondespite considerable challenges and limited resources, it was feasible to implement a pmtct program using peer counselors in urban clinics in zimbabwe.
mercury and selenium biomagnification in a brazilian coastal food web using nitrogen stable isotope analysis: a case study in an area under the influence of the paraiba do sul river plume. concentrations of trace elements (v, cr, mn, fe, co, cu, zn, ga, as, se, rb, sr, mo, ag, cd, sb, cs, ba, t-hg, org-hg, tl and pb) were determined in liver samples of estuarine dolphin (sotalia guianensis; n = 20), franciscana dolphin (pontoporia blainvillei; n = 23), atlantic spotted dolphin (stenella frontalis; n = 2), common dolphin (delphinus capensis; n = 1) and striped dolphin (stenella coeruleoalba; n = 1) incidentally caught along the coast of sao paulo state and parana state, brazil, from 1997 to 1999. the hepatic concentrations of trace elements in the brazilian cetaceans were comparable to the data available in literature on marine mammals from northern hemisphere. concentrations of v, se, mo, cd, t-hg and org-hg increased with increasing age in liver of both estuarine and franciscana dolphins. very high concentrations of cu (range, 262-1970 microg/g dry wt.) and zn (range, 242-369 microg/g dry wt.) were observed in liver of sucklings of estuarine dolphin. hepatic concentrations of v, se, t-hg, org-hg and pb were significantly higher in estuarine dolphin, whereas franciscana dolphin showed higher concentrations of mn, co, as and rb. ratio of org-hg to t-hg in liver was significantly higher in franciscana dolphin than estuarine dolphin, suggesting that demethylation ability of methyl hg might be lower in liver of franciscana than estuarine dolphins. high hepatic concentrations of ag were found in some specimens of franciscana dolphin (maximum, 20 microg/g dry wt.), and 17% of franciscana showed higher concentrations of ag than hg. these samples with high ag concentration also exhibited elevated hepatic se concentration, implying that ag might be detoxified by se in the liver. higher correlation coefficient between (hg+0.5 ag) and se than between hg and se and the large distribution of ag in non-soluble fraction in nuclear and mitochondrial fraction of the liver also suggests that ag might be detoxified by se via formation of ag2se in the liver of franciscana dolphin.
improved analysis of long-term monitoring data demonstrates marked regional declines of bat populations in the eastern united states white-nose syndrome (wns) is a condition associated with an unprecedented bat mortality event in the northeastern united states. since the winter of 2006*2007, bat declines exceeding 75% have been observed at surveyed hibernacula. affected bats often present with visually striking white fungal growth on their muzzles, ears, and/or wing membranes. direct microscopy and culture analyses demonstrated that the skin of wns-affected bats is colonized by a psychro-philic fungus that is phylogenetically related to geomyces spp. but with a conidial morphology distinct from characterized members of this genus. this report characterizes the cutaneous fungal infection associated with wns.
autonomous development of natural interactive behavior for robots and embodied agents embodied synchrony of nonverbal behaviour in counselling: a case study of role playing school counselling chika nagaoka (nagaoka@educ.kyoto-u.ac.jp) sakiko yoshikawa (say@educ.kyoto-u.ac.jp) graduate school of education, kyoto university yoshida honmachi, sakyo, kyoto, 606-8501, japan. masashi komori (komori@isc.osakac.ac.jp) faculty of information science and technology, osaka electro-communication university 18-1 hastu-cho, neyagawa-shi, osaka, 572-8530, japan abstract experienced counsellors have mentioned that the client- counsellor relationship, which is of high importance in counselling, may be related to embodied synchrony of nonverbal behaviour, but there is little quantitative research on the topic. the present study captured the embodied synchrony of nonverbal behaviour in counselling from a multiple communication channel perspective, in order to examine the relationship between these channels. at the same time, the relation between embodied synchrony and the mental processes of the client or counsellor, such as the sense of trust between counsellor and client, was investigated. 9-24 participants rated visual and vocal embodied synchrony and sense of trust in role-playing school counselling scenes. the results indicated that embodied synchrony, such as body movement coordination, similarity of voice strength and coordination and smoothness of response timing, have a co- occurrence relation. moreover, significant correlations with evaluated sense of trust suggested that embodied synchrony can act as an indicator reflecting the mental process of a client or counsellor. counselling is a dialogue between a client and a counsellor who is a skilled listener, and is performed with the purpose of overcoming the client’s mental difficulties or obstacles. the counsellor's verbal/nonverbal responses are experientially known to encourage the client's speech, and have the assistance function of guiding the client's thinking from a confused state to a regulated state . conventionally, in the case of investigating and evaluating counselling, the counsellor’s verbal responses are examined as the key element, and only rarely attention is directed towards nonverbal responses. however, we may assume that nonverbal responses are also playing an important role in counselling. it is expected that analyzing the counsellor's nonverbal behaviour would give an important cue also about the characteristics of the response style of listeners in daily conversations. in this study, embodied synchrony is focused upon as a cue to investigating nonverbal behaviour in counselling. embodied synchrony is a phenomenon in which the interactants’ nonverbal behaviour synchronizes and becomes similar; the listener's movements of the head or arms may synchronize with the flow of the speaker's speech, or the way of speaking, postures, mannerisms, and facial expressions may become similar (e.g. cappella, 1981; hess, philippot, & blairy, 1999; feldstein & welkowitz, 1978; cheng & chartrand, 2003). up to the present, embodied synchrony has been described qualitatively by the subjective impressions of skilled counsellors with abundant experience in counselling, and has been considered to indicate the client-counsellor relationship, which is thought to be of primary importance in counselling. there is also some research which indicates quantitatively the congruence of posture in counselling dialogues (e.g. charny, 1966), as well as other studies that indicate the relation between embodied synchrony, such as congruence of posture, duration of pauses or response latencies (i.e., latency before responding to the partner's last utterance), synchrony of body movements, and empathy (maurer & tindall, 1983; staples & sloane, 1976; hall, harrigan, & rosenthal, 1995; bernieri, davis, rosenthal, & knee, 1994). for measuring the degree of embodied synchrony of nonverbal behaviour, a method suggested by bernieri & rosenthal (1991) has been used. this method consists in judges evaluating directly the degree of the overall embodied synchrony in order to quantify it. as opposed to the conventional single-channel approach in which attention is directed towards a particular channel which is examined in detail, this method attempts at capturing nonverbal behaviour on a multi-channel level. however, this method cannot take paralanguage into consideration. to our knowledge, there has been no such method that allowed quantifying vocal synchrony overall. therefore, in this study, an attempt to quantify vocal embodied synchrony overall, adapting bernieri et al. 's method to measure vocal embodied synchrony, in addition to quantifying embodied synchrony of body movement using this method, is carried out. in other words, it is one of this work’s purposes to capture embodied synchrony from a multi-channel perspective. the necessity for investigating embodied synchrony on a multi-channel level was implied by hall et al. (1995). in the present study, it is also examined whether embodied synchrony occurs as a
tgfβ signaling pathways and human diseases transforming growth factor-beta (tgf-beta) transduces signals through a heteromeric complex of type i (t beta r-i) and type ii (t beta r-ii) tgf-beta receptors. to determine the stoichiometry of this complex we used analysis by affinity labeling with 125i-tgf-beta 1 and covalent cross-linking with disuccinimidyl suberate and immunoprecipitation using t beta r-i- or t beta r-ii-specific antisera, followed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis under nonreducing (first dimension) and reducing (second dimension) conditions. dimers composed of t beta r-i and/or t beta r-ii were observed on mink lung epithelial cells as well as cos-1 cells transfected with t beta r-i and t beta r-ii cdnas. homodimers of t beta r-i could be demonstrated on these cells after dissociation of t beta r-ii by sodium dodecyl sulfate treatment. on the cell surface of mink lung epithelial cell mutants that express only t beta r-ii and do not respond to tgf-beta, and on cos-1 cells transfected with only t beta r-ii, only homodimers of t beta r-ii were seen. the facts that t beta r-i does not bind tgf-beta in the absence of t beta r-ii and that t beta r-ii forms a signaling complex with t beta r-i, together with our observations that homodimers of t beta r-i and t beta r-ii are seen on responsive cells, support the notion that tgf-beta induces the formation of hetero-oligomeric receptor complexes, most likely a heterotetramer containing two molecules each of t beta r-i and t beta r-ii.
penalized normal likelihood and ridge regularization of correlation and covariance matrices many statistical methods for discriminant analysis do not adapt well or easily to situations where the number of variables is large, possibly even exceeding the number of cases in the training set. we explore a variety of methods for providing robust identiication of future samples in this situation. we develop a range of exible bayesian methods, and primarily a new hierarchical covariance compromise method, akin to regularized discriminant analysis. although the methods are much more widely applicable, the motivating problem was that of discriminating between groups of samples on the basis of their near infrared spectra. here the ability of the bayesian methods to take account of continuity of the spectra may be beneecial. the spectra may consist of absorbances or reeectances at as many as 1000 wavelengths, and yet there may be only tens or hundreds of training samples where both sample spectrum and group identity are known. such problems arise in the food and pharmaceutical industries, for example the authentication of food (eg. detecting the adulteration of orange juice) and the identiication of pharmaceutical drug ingredients. our illustrating example concerns the discrimination of 39 microbiological taxa and 8 aggregate genera. simulations also illustrate the eeectiveness of the hierarchical bayes covariance method. we discuss a number of scoring rules both local and global for judging the t of data to the bayesian models, and adopt a cross-classiicatory approach for estimating hyperparameters.
regulation of endothelial inflammation by tam receptors the endothelial cell is thought to arise from the splanchnopleuric mesoderm. endothelial cells form the inner lining of a blood vessel and provides an anticoagulant barrier between the vessel wall and blood. in addition to its role as a selective permeability barrier, the endothelial cell is a unique multifunctional cell with critical basal and inducible metabolic and synthetic functions. the endothelial cell reacts with physical and chemical stimuli within the circulation and regulates hemostasis, vasomotor tone, and immune and inflammatory responses. in addition, the endothelial cell is pivotal in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. endothelial cell injury, activation or dysfunction is a hallmark of many pathologic states including atherosclerosis, loss of semi-permeable membrane function, and thrombosis. cell facts: (1) endothelium consists of approximately (1-6) x 10(13) endothelial cells forming an almost 1 kg organ. (2) they uniquely contain weibel-palade bodies, 0.1 microm wide, 3 microm long membrane-bound structures that represent the storage organelle for von willebrand factor (vwf). (3) the endothelial cell is not only a permeability barrier but also a multifunctional paracrine and endocrine organ. it is involved in the immune response, coagulation, growth regulation, production of extracellular matrix components, and is a modulator of blood flow and blood vessel tone.
impact of right ventricular dyssynchrony on left ventricular performance in patients with pulmonary hypertension mitral and tricuspid are increasingly prevalent. doppler echocardiography not only detects the presence of regurgitation but also permits to understand mechanisms of regurgitation, quantification of its severity and repercussions. the present document aims to provide standards for the assessment of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
nanotherapy for early dementia: targeting senile endothelium vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (vcid) is the second leading cause of dementia behind alzheimer's disease (ad) and is a frequent co-morbidity with ad. despite its prevalence, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the cognitive dysfunction resulting from cerebrovascular disease. astrocytic end-feet almost completely surround intraparenchymal blood vessels in the brain and express a variety of channels and markers indicative of their specialized functions in the maintenance of ionic and osmotic homeostasis and gliovascular signaling. these functions are mediated by end-foot enrichment of the aquaporin 4 water channel (aqp4), the inward rectifying potassium channel kir4.1 and the calcium-dependent potassium channel maxik. using our hyperhomocysteinemia (hhcy) model of vcid we examined the time-course of astrocytic end-foot changes along with cognitive and neuroinflammatory outcomes. we found that there were significant astrocytic end-foot disruptions in the hhcy model. aqp4 becomes dislocalized from the end-feet, there is a loss of kir4.1 and maxik protein expression, as well as a loss of the dp71 protein known to anchor the kir4.1, maxik and aqp4 channels to the end-foot membrane. neuroinflammation occurs prior to the astrocytic changes, while cognitive impairment continues to decline with the exacerbation of the astrocytic changes. we have previously reported similar astrocytic changes in models of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (caa) and therefore, we believe astrocytic end-foot disruption could represent a common cellular mechanism of vcid and may be a target for therapeutic development.
salvage brachytherapy in prostate local recurrence after radiation therapy: predicting factors for control and toxicity purpose we describe the treatment outcome in 17 patients who received combined salvage brachytherapy and short-term androgen deprivation therapy for local prostate cancer relapse after prior external beam irradiation.   materials and methods median patient age was 68 years. local relapse after external beam irradiation was confirmed by biopsy. median prostate specific antigen at local relapse was 4.7 ng/ml. five of the 17 patients were enrolled in a protocol combining androgen deprivation therapy with brachytherapy and the remaining men were treated off protocol. all patients received neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy for a median of 3 months, followed by ultrasound guided brachytherapy using 125i in 9 and 103pd seeds in 8. five patients also received adjuvant leuprolide for a median of 6 months. biochemical failure was defined using the american society for therapeutic radiology and oncology definition. toxicity was graded with a modified radiation therapy oncology group scale.   results median followup was 44 months. the actuarial 4-year biochemical control rate was 75%. three patients died of intercurrent diseases. no prostate cancer mortality or local failure had occurred at last followup. one patient had bone metastasis. no clinical or treatment factor was associated with biochemical control. grade 3 and 4 genitourinary toxicity developed in 7 (41%) and 1 patients (6%), respectively. grade 2 and 3 gastrointestinal toxicity occurred in 5 (29%) and 1 patients (6%), respectively.   conclusions our series suggests that salvage brachytherapy and short-term androgen deprivation therapy can achieve biochemical control in select patients with local relapse after prior external beam irradiation. the major side effects are urinary complications, including grade 3 and 4 complications in 41% and 6% of cases, respectively.
monetary policy delegation and equilibrium coordination why is it that inflation is persistently high in some periods and persistently low in other periods? we argue that lack of commitment in monetary policy may bear a large part of the blame. we show that, in a standard equilibrium model, absence of commitment leads to multiple equilibria, or expectation traps. in these traps, expectations of high or low inflation lead the public to take defensive actions which then make it optimal for the monetary authority to validate those expectations. we find support in cross-country evidence for key implications of the model.
recent increases in injury mortality among children and adolescents aged 10-19 years in the united states: 1999-2016. the relationship between short-term macroeconomic growth and temporary mortality increases remains strongest for motor vehicle (mv) crashes. in this paper, i investigate the mechanisms that explain falling mv fatality rates during the recent great recession. using u.s. state-level panel data from 2003 to 2013, i first estimate the relationship between unemployment and mv fatality rate and then decompose it into risk and exposure factors for different types of mv crashes. results reveal a significant 2.9 percent decrease in mv fatality rate for each percentage point increase in unemployment rate. this relationship is almost entirely explained by changes in the risk of driving rather than exposure to the amount of driving and is particularly robust for crashes involving large commercial trucks, multiple vehicles, and speeding cars. these findings provide evidence suggesting traffic patterns directly related to economic activity lead to higher risk of mv fatality rates when the economy improves.
regulation of collagen fibrillogenesis by cell-surface expression of kinase dead ddr2. the discoidin domain receptors, ddr1 and ddr2, are receptor tyrosine kinases that are activated by native triple-helical collagen. here we have located three specific ddr2 binding sites by screening the entire triple-helical domain of collagen ii, using the collagen ii toolkit, a set of overlapping triple-helical peptides. the peptide sequence that bound ddr2 with highest affinity interestingly contained the sequence for the high affinity binding site for von willebrand factor in collagen iii. focusing on this sequence, we used a set of truncated and alanine-substituted peptides to characterize the sequence gvmgfo (o is hydroxyproline) as the minimal collagen sequence required for ddr2 binding. based on a recent nmr analysis of the ddr2 collagen binding domain, we generated a model of the ddr2-collagen interaction that explains why a triple-helical conformation is required for binding. triple-helical peptides comprising the ddr2 binding motif not only inhibited ddr2 binding to collagen ii but also activated ddr2 transmembrane signaling. thus, ddr2 activation may be effected by single triple-helices rather than fibrillar collagen.
geneseer: a sage for gene names and genomic resources ensembl (http://www.ensembl.org/) is a bioinformatics project to organize biological information around the sequences of large genomes. it is a comprehensive source of stable automatic annotation of individual genomes, and of the synteny and orthology relationships between them. it is also a framework for integration of any biological data that can be mapped onto features derived from the genomic sequence. ensembl is available as an interactive web site, a set of flat files, and as a complete, portable open source software system for handling genomes. all data are provided without restriction, and code is freely available. ensembl's aims are to continue to "widen" this biological integration to include other model organisms relevant to understanding human biology as they become available; to "deepen" this integration to provide an ever more seamless linkage between equivalent components in different species; and to provide further classification of functional elements in the genome that have been previously elusive.
hypercube network fault tolerance: a probabilistic approach introduces a new measure of conditional connectivity for large regular graphs by requiring each vertex to have at least g good neighbors in the graph. based on this requirement, the vertex connectivity for the n-dimensional cube is obtained, and the minimal sets of faulty nodes that disconnect the cube are characterized. >
assessing biodiversity integrity for the conservation of grazed and burnt grassland systems: avian field metabolic rates as a rapid assessment tool in this study, we investigated the responses of two faunal groups, birds and arthropods, to varying degrees of disturbance caused by fire and grazing in south africa, eight study sites of varying fire frequency and stocking density were studied over two summer seasons (october–march). bird assemblages reflected habitat disturbance in a diversity of ways, driven by factors ranging from direct disturbance to changes in habitat structure and functioning, and shifts in food availability. similarly, arthropod diversity and abundance changed seasonally in response to management practices. fire frequency drives faunal assemblage structure and abundance and, in most cases, overrides the effects of grazing at all taxonomic levels. in particular, fire frequency strongly influenced grassland-breeding birds because farms are burnt in the territory-forming stage of the breeding cycle. insectivores and nectarivores were disproportionately impacted by intensive commercial management. of particular concern in this system is the yellow-breasted pipit (anthus chloris), which is regionally and globally vulnerable because of habitat loss. this species is sensitive to any form of habitat disturbance, highlighting the need for conservation attention in these grasslands. of the ten arthropod orders present in the study area, only orthoptera responded positively to burning. however, orthopterans made up on average 78% of arthropod biomass in moist highland grasslands, resulting in high grasshopper biomass on annually burnt farms: this high biomass in turn supports an abundance of insectivores. this reinforces the importance of process-oriented data where a measure of performance, such as reproductive success, is considered in assessing ecosystem condition.
a comparator-based rail clamp two esd clamp circuit design techniques have been developed to reduce cell size and to combat the effects of gate leakage that have become significant in recent generations of digital cmos process technology. such clamps have proven to be able to withstand hbm stresses of 6kv and cdm pulses of 1.2kv.
separation of water artifacts in 2d noesy protein spectra using congruent matrix pencils multidimensional proton nmr spectra of biomolecules dissolved in aqueous solutions are usually contaminated by an intense water artifact. we discuss the application of the generalized eigenvalue decomposition (gevd) method using a matrix pencil to solve the blind source separation problem of removing the intense solvent peak and related artifacts. 2d noesy spectra of simple solutes as well as dissolved proteins are studied.
age-related changes in motor control during unimanual movements we measured the distribution of regional cerebral blood flow with positron emission tomography while three subjects moved their hand, shoulder, or leg. the images were coregistered with each individual's anatomic magnetic resonance scans. the data were analyzed for each individual to avoid intersubject averaging and so to preserve individual gyral anatomy. instead of inspecting all pixels, we prospectively restricted the data analysis to particular areas of interest. these were defined on basis of the anatomic and physiological literature on nonhuman primates. by examining only a subset of areas, we strengthened the power of the statistical analysis and thereby increased the confidence in reporting single subject data. on the lateral convexity, motor related activity was found for all three subjects in the primary motor cortex, lateral premotor cortex, and an opercular area within the premotor cortex. in addition, there was activation of somatosensory cortex (si), the supplementary somatosensory area (sii) in the sylvian fissure, and parietal association areas (brodmann areas 5 and 40). there was also activation in the insula. we suggest that the activation in the dorsal premotor cortex may correspond with dorsal premotor area (pmd) as described in the macaque brain. we propose three hypotheses as to the probable location of vental premotor area (pmv) in the human brain. on the medial surface, motor-related activity was found for all three subjects in the leg areas of the primary motor cortex and somatosensory cortex and also activity for the hand, shoulder, and leg in the supplementary motor area (sma) on the dorsal medial convexity and in three areas in the cingulate sulcus. we suggest that the three cingulate areas may correspond with rostral cingulate premotor area, dorsal cingulate motor area (cmad), and ventral cingulate motor area (cmav) as identified in the macaque brain. somatotopic mapping was demonstrated in the primary motor and primary somatosensory cortex. in all three subjects, the arm region lay anterior to the leg region in parietal area 5. also in all three subjects, the arm region lay anterior to the leg region in the supplementary motor cortex.
mcl-1 regulates effector and memory cd8 t-cell differentiation during acute viral infection. regulated apoptosis is essential for both the development and the subsequent maintenance of the immune system. interleukins, including il-2, il-4, il-7 and il-15, heavily influence lymphocyte survival during the vulnerable stages of vdj rearrangement and later in ensuring cellular homeostasis, but the genes specifically responsible for the development and maintenance of lymphocytes have not been identified. the antiapoptotic protein mcl-1 is an attractive candidate, as it is highly regulated, appears to enhance short-term survival and functions at an apical step in genotoxic deaths. however, mcl-1 deficiency results in peri-implantation lethality. here we show that mice conditional for mcl-1 display a profound reduction in b and t lymphocytes when mcl-1 is removed. deletion of mcl-1 during early lymphocyte differentiation increased apoptosis and arrested the development at pro-b-cell and double-negative t-cell stages. induced deletion of mcl-1 in peripheral b- and t-cell populations resulted in their rapid loss. moreover, il-7 both induced and required mcl-1 to mediate lymphocyte survival. thus, mcl-1, which selectively inhibits the proapoptotic protein bim, is essential both early in lymphoid development and later on in the maintenance of mature lymphocytes.
recognizing player goals in open-ended digital games with markov logic networks goal recognition for dialogue systems needs to be fast, make early predictions, and be portable. we present initial work which shows that using statistical, corpus-based methods to build goal recognizers may be a viable way to meet those needs. our goal recognizer is trained on data from apian corpus and then used to determine the agent's most likely goal based on that data. the algorithm is linear in the number of goals, and performs very well in terms of accuracy and early prediction. in addition, it is more easily portable to new domains as does not require a hand-crafted plan library.
endoscopic management of antrochoanal polyps: a single uk centre’s experience antrochoanal polyps (acp) are benign lesions that arise from the mucosa of the maxillary sinus, grow into the maxillary sinus and reach the choana, and nasal obstruction being their main symptom. it is an interesting model to compare the pathophysiological mechanisms with those of bilateral nasal polyposis (np). there is a lack of research in some areas of acp, which have to become the main aims for future investigations of this disease. in comparison to np, acps are usually unilateral and appear in younger patients. macroscopically, they have a cystic intramaxillary portion and a solid intranasal portion. microscopically, they are similar to a maxillary cyst of the mucosa. nasal endoscopy, computed tomography and magnetic resonance are the main diagnostic techniques. surgery is the indicated treatment for acp, with endoscopic resection the most recommended. simple avulsion of the polyp has a high rate of recurrence, whereas the caldwell-luc procedure is associated with damage of the maxillary and dental growth centres. more research is needed to establish the relationship between chronic sinusitis and acp. further work is also needed to investigate the role of inflammatory mediators (histamine, ige, adhesion molecules, paf), as well as metalloproteases and nasal remodelling, and tumour marker expression in a cp.
implications of the impact of prevalence on test thresholds and outcomes: lessons from tuberculosis test accuracy of interferon-gamma release assays (igras) for diagnosing tb differs when using older or precommercial tools and inconsistent diagnostic criteria. this metaanalysis critically appraises studies investigating sensitivity and specificity of the commercial t-spot.tb and the quantiferon-tb gold in-tube assay (qft-it) among definitely confirmed tb cases. we searched medline, embase, and cochrane bibliographies of relevant articles. sensitivities, specificities, and indeterminate rates were pooled using a fixed effect model. sensitivity of the tuberculin skin test (tst) was evaluated in the context of igra studies. in addition, the rates of indeterminates of both igras were assessed. the pooled sensitivity of tst was 70% (95% ci, 0.67-0.72) compared with 81% (95% ci, 0.78-0.83) for the qft-it and 88% (95% ci, 0.85-0.90) for the t-spot.tb. sensitivity increased to 84% (95%ci, 0.81-0.87) and 89% (95% ci, 0.86-0.91) for the qft-it and t-spot.tb, respectively, when restricted to performance in developed countries. in contrast, specificity of the qft-it was 99% (95% ci, 0.98-1.00) vs 86% for the t-spot.tb (95% ci, 0.81-0.90). the pooled rate of indeterminate results was low, 2.1% (95% ci, 0.02-0.023) for the qft-it and 3.8% (95% ci, 0.035-0.042) for the t-spot.tb, increasing to 4.4% (95% ci, 0.039-0.05) and 6.1% (95% ci, 0.052-0.071), respectively, among immunosuppressed hosts. the newest commercial igras are superior, in comparison with the tst, for detecting confirmed active tb disease, especially when performed in developed countries.
rapid development of adaptive, climate-driven clinal variation in seed mass in the invasive annual forb echium plantagineum l. biological invasions may expose populations to strong selection for local adaptation along geographical gradients in climate. however, evolution during contemporary timescales can be constrained by low standing genetic variation and genetic correlations among life-history traits. we examined limits to local adaptation associated with northern migration of the invasive wetland plant purple loosestrife (lythrum salicaria) using a selection model incorporating a trade-off between flowering time and size at reproduction, and common garden experiments of populations sampled along a latitudinal transect of approximately 1200 km in eastern north america. a strong trade-off between flowering time and size at reproduction caused early-flowering plants to be smaller with reduced seed production in northern populations. northward spread was associated with a decline in genetic variance within populations and an increase in genetic skew for flowering time and size, with limited genetic variation for small, early-flowering genotypes. these patterns were predicted by our selection model of local adaptation to shorter growing seasons and were not consistent with expectations from non-adaptive processes. reduced fecundity may limit population growth and rates of spread in northern populations. identifying genetic constraints on key life-history traits can provide novel insights into invasion dynamics and the causes of range limits in introduced species.
studying work practices: a key factor in understanding accidents on the level triggered by a balance disturbance the vast majority of the published workplace slips, trips and falls (stf) literature is exceedingly narrow in its focus and often ignores wider systems issues in workplace stf aetiology. there is little recognition within the published literature of the importance of latent failures or the upstream organisational and cultural contexts within which workplace stf occur. this is unfortunate, as a systems approach to workplace stf analysis, that is inclusive of latent design and work organisation factors that often shape worker behaviour patterns related to stf risk (e.g. rushing, risk taking), is fundamental to the development of effective prevention measures. the aims of this paper are to provide an understanding of workplace stf causation that is cognisant of the potential role of both active and latent failures in stf causation. the paper presents an ergonomics model for workplace stf analysis that highlights information processing in stf aetiology, the stf incident process and the interaction between latent and active failures in stf causation. the paper draws upon ergonomics research conducted in a range of occupational contexts to illustrate the key features of the model as it applies to workplace stf. implications of the model for analysis and prevention of stf are discussed.
regulation of coniferaldehyde 5-hydroxylase expression to modulate cell wall lignin structure in rice background lignin, nature’s dominant aromatic polymer, is found in most terrestrial plants in the approximate range of 15 to 40% dry weight and provides structural integrity. traditionally, most large-scale industrial processes that use plant polysaccharides have burned lignin to generate the power needed to productively transform biomass. the advent of biorefineries that convert cellulosic biomass into liquid transportation fuels will generate substantially more lignin than necessary to power the operation, and therefore efforts are underway to transform it to value-added products. production of biofuels from cellulosic biomass requires separation of large quantities of the aromatic polymer lignin. in planta genetic engineering, enhanced extraction methods, and a deeper understanding of the structure of lignin are yielding promising opportunities for efficient conversion of this renewable resource to carbon fibers, polymers, commodity chemicals, and fuels. [credit: oak ridge national laboratory, u.s. department of energy] advances bioengineering to modify lignin structure and/or incorporate atypical components has shown promise toward facilitating recovery and chemical transformation of lignin under biorefinery conditions. the flexibility in lignin monomer composition has proven useful for enhancing extraction efficiency. both the mining of genetic variants in native populations of bioenergy crops and direct genetic manipulation of biosynthesis pathways have produced lignin feedstocks with unique properties for coproduct development. advances in analytical chemistry and computational modeling detail the structure of the modified lignin and direct bioengineering strategies for targeted properties. refinement of biomass pretreatment technologies has further facilitated lignin recovery and enables catalytic modifications for desired chemical and physical properties. outlook potential high-value products from isolated lignin include low-cost carbon fiber, engineering plastics and thermoplastic elastomers, polymeric foams and membranes, and a variety of fuels and chemicals all currently sourced from petroleum. these lignin coproducts must be low cost and perform as well as petroleum-derived counterparts. each product stream has its own distinct challenges. development of renewable lignin-based polymers requires improved processing technologies coupled to tailored bioenergy crops incorporating lignin with the desired chemical and physical properties. for fuels and chemicals, multiple strategies have emerged for lignin depolymerization and upgrading, including thermochemical treatments and homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. the multifunctional nature of lignin has historically yielded multiple product streams, which require extensive separation and purification procedures, but engineering plant feedstocks for greater structural homogeneity and tailored functionality reduces this challenge. the lignin landscape lignin is a chemically complex polymer that lends woody plants and trees their rigidity. humans have traditionally either left it intact to lend rigidity to their own wooden constructs, or burned it to generate heat and sometimes power. with the advent of major biorefining operations to convert cellulosic biomass into ethanol and other liquid fuels, researchers are now exploring how to transform the associated leftover lignin into more diverse and valuable products. ragauskas et al. (10.1126/science.1246843) review recent developments in this area, ranging from genetic engineering approaches that tune lignin properties at the source, to chemical processing techniques directed toward extracting lignin in the biorefinery and transforming it into high-performance plastics and a variety of bulk and fine chemicals. research and development activities directed toward commercial production of cellulosic ethanol have created the opportunity to dramatically increase the transformation of lignin to value-added products. here, we highlight recent advances in this lignin valorization effort. discovery of genetic variants in native populations of bioenergy crops and direct manipulation of biosynthesis pathways have produced lignin feedstocks with favorable properties for recovery and downstream conversion. advances in analytical chemistry and computational modeling detail the structure of the modified lignin and direct bioengineering strategies for future targeted properties. refinement of biomass pretreatment technologies has further facilitated lignin recovery, and this coupled with genetic engineering will enable new uses for this biopolymer, including low-cost carbon fibers, engineered plastics and thermoplastic elastomers, polymeric foams, fungible fuels, and commodity chemicals.
noscapine recirculates enterohepatically and induces self-clearance. abstract noscapine, a phthalideisoquinoline alkaloid derived from opium, has been used as an oral anti-tussive agent and has shown very few toxic effects in animals or humans. recently, we reported that noscapine binds stoichiometrically to tubulin and promotes microtubule polymerization. noscapine causes growth arrest of tumor cells in mitosis and induces apoptosis of tumor cells in vitro. previous experiments also showed that noscapine has potent antitumor activity in mice when administered parenterally or by gastric lavage. here, we report that the anti-mitotic effect was specific to noscapine since closely related compounds did not inhibit the growth of a lymphoma cell line. in addition, noscapine was shown to be effective in reducing the growth of the lymphoma and increasing the survival of tumor-bearing mice when administered in the drinking water. it is noteworthy that, noscapine showed little or no toxicity to kidney, liver, heart, bone marrow, spleen or small intestine at tumor-suppressive doses. furthermore, oral noscapine did not inhibit primary immune responses, which are critically dependent upon proliferation of lymphoid cells. thus, our results indicate that noscapine has the potential to be an effective chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of human cancer.
multiplanar osteotomy with limited wide margins: a tissue preserving surgical technique for high-grade bone sarcomas background the purpose of this study was to analyze a series of patients with a high-grade metaphyseal osteosarcoma of the knee who had been treated with a transepiphyseal resection, with preservation of the distal femoral and the proximal tibial (articular) portions of the epiphysis, and an intercalary allograft reconstruction.   methods the cases of thirteen patients with a high-grade metaphyseal osteosarcoma around the knee who had transepiphyseal resection and reconstruction with an intercalary allograft were retrospectively reviewed at a mean of sixty-three months. complications, disease-free survival of the patient, final preservation of the limb and epiphysis, and functional results according to the musculoskeletal tumor society scoring system were documented at the time of the latest follow-up.   results at the final follow-up examination, eleven of the thirteen patients continued to be disease-free. one patient died of bone and pulmonary metastases with no evidence of local recurrence, and the remaining patient had no evidence of disease after resection of a local recurrence of the tumor in the soft tissues. no patient had a local recurrence in the remaining epiphysis. seven patients had complications that included a fracture (three patients), diaphyseal nonunion (two), deep infection (one), and a local recurrence in the soft tissues (one). the allograft was removed in only four of these patients. at the latest follow-up examination, twelve patients were alive with preserved limbs. in one patient, the epiphysis, which originally had been preserved, was resected because of a metaphyseal fracture, and the limb was reconstructed with an osteoarticular allograft. the patients with a preserved epiphysis had an average functional score of 27 points (maximum, 30 points).   conclusions preservation of the epiphysis in high-grade metaphyseal osteosarcoma at the knee is an alternative in carefully selected patients. crucial factors needed to obtain local tumor control and achieve an acceptable functional result are a positive response to chemotherapy, accurate preoperative assessment of tumor extension to the epiphysis, and appropriate fixation techniques for intercalary allografts.   level of evidence therapeutic study, level iv (case series [no, or historical, control group]). see instructions to authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.
unsupervised detection of opium poppy fields in afghanistan from e0-1 hyperion data principal component analysis (pca) is one of the most commonly adopted feature reduction techniques in remote sensing image analysis. however, it may overlook subtle but useful information if applied directly to the analysis of hyperspectral data, especially for discriminating between different vegetation types. in order to accurately map an invasive plant species (horse tamarind, leucaena leucocephala) in southern taiwan using hyperion hyperspectral imagery, this study developed a spectrally segmented pca based on the spectral characteristics of vegetation over different wavelength regions. the developed algorithm can not only reduce the dimensionality of hyperspectral imagery but also extracts helpful information for differentiating more effectively the target plant species from other vegetation types. experiments conducted in this study demonstrated that the developed algorithm performs better than correlation‐based segmented principal component transformation (spct) and conventional pca (overall accuracy: 86%, 76%, 66%; kappa value: 0.81, 0.69, 0.57) in detecting the target plant species, as well as mapping other vegetation covers.
non-neutralizing antibodies alter the course of hiv-1 infection in vivo a monoclonal antibody (694/98-d) directed toward the v3 loop of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) was evaluated for pre- and postexposure prophylaxis in scid mice reconstituted with human peripheral blood lymphocytes (hu-pbl-scid). fifty percent protection against the hiv-1lai strain was obtained by preexposure administration of 1.32 mg/kg antibody. however, virus isolated from 1 mouse 3 weeks after passive immunization with 13.2 mg/kg antibody proved resistant to subsequent in vitro neutralization by 694/98-d. v3 loop sequence analysis of cloned virus revealed amino acid changes within the linear core epitope recognized by 694/98-d and in one flanking amino acid. further evaluation of 694/98-d for postexposure prophylaxis in mice revealed that 694/ 98-d was effective when given 15 min after virus. however, efficacy declined to 50% if treatment was delayed to 1 h after virus inoculation. these studies point out some potential drawbacks of passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies.
clinical, radiographic and microbiological evaluation of high level laser therapy, a new photodynamic therapy protocol, in peri-implantitis treatment; a pilot experience objectives the aim of this study was to analyse the proportions of peri-implant lesions at implants after 9-14 years of function.   material and methods two hundred and ninety-four patients underwent implant therapy during the years 1988-1992 in kristianstad county. these individuals were recalled to the speciality clinic 1 and 5 years after placement of the suprastructure. between 2000 and 2002, 218 patients with 999 implants were examined clinically and radiographically.   results forty-eight per cent of the implants had probing depth > or =4 mm and bleeding on probing (peri-implant mucositis). in 20.4% of the implants, the bone level was located 3.1 mm apical to the implant shoulder. progressive bone loss (> or =1.8 mm) during the observation period was found in 7.7% of the implants. peri-implantitis defined as bone loss > or =1.8 mm compared with 1-year data (the apical border of the bony defect located at or apical to the third thread, i.e. a minimum of 3.1 mm apical to the implant shoulder), combined with bleeding on probing and or pus, were diagnosed among 16% of the patients and 6.6% of the implants.   conclusion after 10 years in use without systematic supportive treatment, peri-implant lesions is a common clinical entity adjacent to titanium implants.
quasispecies-like behavior observed in catalytic rna populations evolving in a test tube background catalytic rnas, or ribozymes, possessing both a genotype and a phenotype, are ideal molecules for evolution experiments in vitro. a large, heterogeneous pool of rnas can be subjected to multiple rounds of selection, amplification and mutation, leading to the development of variants that have some desired phenotype. such experiments allow the investigator to correlate specific genetic changes with quantifiable alterations of the catalytic properties of the rna. in addition, patterns of evolutionary change can be discerned through a detailed examination of the genotypic composition of the evolving rna population.   results beginning with a pool of 10(13) variants of the tetrahymena ribozyme, we carried out in vitro evolution experiments that led to the generation of ribozymes with the ability to cleave an rna substrate in the presence of ca2+ ions, an activity that does not exist for the wild-type molecule. over the course of 12 generations, a seven-error variant emerged that has substantial ca(2+)-dependent rna-cleavage activity. advantageous mutations increased in frequency in the population according to three distinct dynamics--logarithmic, linear and transient. through a comparative analysis of 31 individual variants, we infer how certain mutations influence the catalytic properties of the ribozyme.   conclusions in vitro evolution experiments make it possible to elucidate important aspects of both evolutionary biology and structural biochemistry on a reasonable short time scale.
nevus comedonicus: a case series abstract: we report extensive nevus comedonicus in a female patient that involved half of her body entirely, with infected cystic lesions as well as typical scars, limited by the midline. the lesions worsened at the beginning of puberty. a brief review of the literature highlights the histopathologic, etiopathogenic, and therapeutic aspects.
reactive sc : speculatively relaxing memory consistency model contraints using dynamic classification of cache blocks sequential consistency (sc) is arguably the most intuitive behavior for a shared-memory multithreaded program. it is widely accepted that language-level sc could significantly improve programmability of a multiprocessor system. however, efficiently supporting end-to-end sc remains a challenge as it requires that both compiler and hardware optimizations preserve sc semantics. while a recent study has shown that a compiler can preserve sc semantics for a small performance cost, an efficient and complexity-effective sc hardware remains elusive. past hardware solutions relied on aggressive speculation techniques, which has not yet been realized in a practical implementation. this paper exploits the observation that hardware need not enforce any memory model constraints on accesses to thread-local and shared read-only locations. a processor can easily determine a large fraction of these safe accesses with assistance from static compiler analysis and the hardware memory management unit. we discuss a low-complexity hardware design that exploits this information to reduce the overhead in ensuring sc. our design employs an additional unordered store buffer for fast-tracking thread-local stores and allowing later memory accesses to proceed without a memory ordering related stall. our experimental study shows that the cost of guaranteeing end-to-end sc is only 6.2% on average when compared to a system with tso hardware executing a stock compiler's output.
biofilter performance and characterization of a biocatalyst degrading alkylbenzene gases a biological trickling filter for treatment of toluene-containing waste gas was studied. the overall kinetics of the biofilm growth was followed in the early growth phase. a rapid initial colonization took place during the first three days. the biofilm thickness increased exponentially, whereas the incease of active biomass and polymers was linear. in order to investigate the toluene degradation, various toluene degraders from the multispecies biofilm were isolated, and a pseudomonas putida was chosen as a representative of the toluene-degrading population. a specific rrna oligonucleotide probe was used to follow the toluene-degrading p. putida in the multispecies biofilm in the filter by means of number and cellular rrna content. p. putida appeared to detach from the biofilm during the first three days of growth, after which p. putida was found at a constant level of 10% of the active biomass in the biofilm. based on the rrna content, the in situ activity was estimated to be reduced to 20% of cells grown at maximum conditions in batch culture. the toluene degraded by p. putida was estimated to be a minor part (11%) of the overall toluene degradation.
hand function is impaired in healthy older adults at risk of parkinson’s disease in recent studies, we have found a marked increase in substantia nigra (sn) echogenicity in patients with parkinson's disease (pd) using transcranial ultrasound. because a substantial body of evidence has accumulated indicating a selective elevation of iron in the sn from patients with pd, we set out to test the hypothesis that trace metals like iron could lead to the observed increase of sn echogenicity in pd. rat brains were scanned after stereotactic injection of iron in different concentrations into the sn and after injecting ferritin, zinc and 6-ohda alone, and after the addition of desferrioxamine. the amount of iron in the sn was measured spectroscopically. for iron, and partly for 6-ohda, in different concentrations, a dose-dependent increase of sn echogenicity could be visualized, corresponding to an increase of iron measured by spectroscopy. no increase of echogenicity was visualized after the injection of ferritin and the addition of desferrioxamine to 6-ohda, though an increase of iron was measured by spectroscopy. therefore, we conclude that iron not bound to these proteins may lead to an increase of echogenicity of the sn.
concomitant production of detergent compatible enzymes by bacillus flexus xju-1 abstract lipases, triacylglycerol hydrolases, are an important group of biotechnologically relevant enzymes and they find immense applications in food, dairy, detergent and pharmaceutical industries. lipases are by and large produced from microbes and specifically bacterial lipases play a vital role in commercial ventures. some important lipase-producing bacterial genera include bacillus, pseudomonas and burkholderia. lipases are generally produced on lipidic carbon, such as oils, fatty acids, glycerol or tweens in the presence of an organic nitrogen source. bacterial lipases are mostly extracellular and are produced by submerged fermentation. the enzyme is most commonly purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography, in addition to some modern approaches such as reverse micellar and aqueous two-phase systems. most lipases can act in a wide range of ph and temperature, though alkaline bacterial lipases are more common. lipases are serine hydrolases and have high stability in organic solvents. besides these, some lipases exhibit chemo-, regio- and enantioselectivity. the latest trend in lipase research is the development of novel and improved lipases through molecular approaches such as directed evolution and exploring natural communities by the metagenomic approach.
annual and diurnal variations of gaseous and particulate pollutants in 31 provincial capital cities based on in situ air quality monitoring data from china national environmental monitoring center. o3 and pm2.5 were introduced into the newly revised air quality standard system in february 2012, representing a milestone in the history of air pollution control, and china's urban air quality will be evaluated using six factors (so2, no2, o3, co, pm2.5 and pm10) from the beginning of 2013. to achieve the new air quality standard, it is extremely important to have a primary understanding of the current pollution status in various cities. the spatial and temporal variations of the air pollutants were investigated in 26 pilot cities in china from august 2011 to february 2012, just before the new standard was executed. hourly averaged so2, no2 and pm10 were observed in 26 cities, and the pollutants o3, co and pm2.5 were measured in 15 of the 26 cities. the concentrations of so2 and co were much higher in the cities in north china than those in the south. as for o3 and no2, however, there was no significant difference between northern and southern cities. fine particles were found to account for a large proportion of airborne particles, with the ratio of pm2.5 to pm10 ranging from 55% to 77%. the concentrations of pm2.5 (57.5 microg/m3) and pm10 (91.2 microg/m3) were much higher than the values (pm2.5: 11.2 microg/m3; pm10: 35.6 microg/m3) recommended by the world health organization. the attainment of the new urban air quality standard in the investigated cities is decreased by 20% in comparison with the older standard without considering o3, co and pm2.5, suggesting a great challenge in urban air quality improvement, and more efforts will to be taken to control air pollution in china.
bar-sh3 sorting nexins are conserved interacting proteins of nervous wreck that organize synapses and promote neurotransmission in drosophila, the larval neuromuscular junction is particularly tractable for studying how synapses develop and function. in contrast to vertebrate central synapses, each presynaptic motor neuron and postsynaptic muscle cell is unique and identifiable, and the wiring circuit is invariant. thus, the full power of drosophila genetics can be brought to bear on a single, reproducibly identifiable, synaptic terminal. each individual neuromuscular junction encompasses hundreds of synaptic neurotransmitter release sites housed in a chain of synaptic boutons. recent advances have increased our understanding of the mechanisms that shape the development of both individual synapses--that is, the transmitter release sites including active zones and their apposed glutamate receptor clusters--and the whole synaptic terminal that connects a pre- and post-synaptic cell.
typical monoterpenes as insecticides and repellents against stored grain pests global warming and deforestation have resulted in the relocation of many living creatures including insects during the recent years. this has affected the population balance of disease vectors including mosquitoes resulting in outbreaks. traditionally, mankind has been using plants as means of protection from the mosquitoes which are considered to be environment friendly unlike the synthetic chemicals that cause major risk to human health and the ecosystem. researchers explored mainly, essential oils and traditional plants using different testing methodologies to find out repellent molecules effective against mosquitoes which is the main focus of this review. among the promising plant species, eucalyptus spp., ocimum spp. and cymbopogon spp. are the most cited. data of repellency produced from the bioassay systems is difficult to quantify because of different parameters, testing system and standards of material used against mosquitoes. mainly, the human forearm based bioassays have been used with different sizes of treatment area in the laboratory and the results have not been tested in the field conditions for residual activity. in addition, effectiveness of essential oils and their protection time can be increased by using vanillin as synergist and formulation techniques like microencapsulation and nanoemulsion. there is a need to develop an alternate in vitro bioassay system that can address the problems of uniformity of the results.
brain metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma: a case report and literature review cancer registrations among young individuals (under age 30 years) for a 30‐year period (1960–1989) were used to investigate the risk of cancer in migrants to israel, and in their offspring, relative to israel‐born individuals with israel‐born parents. relative risks of testis and ovarian cancer (germ cell tumours and carcinomas), melanoma, and carcinomas of nasopharynx, colorectum, breast, cervix and thyroid were calculated according to father's birthplace, and odds ratios for birthplace of mother, or of both parents. the estimates were adjusted for the effects of age, sex and time period. for 3 cancers, i.e., testis cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and melanoma, there were quite large differences in incidence, which persisted to some degree into the second generation, suggesting that inherited susceptibility may underlie some of the variation. for ovarian, colorectal, cervical and thyroid cancers, differences in risk between the migrant groups had largely disappeared in their offspring, suggesting that environmental exposures, which were modified by migration, are the major causative factors. int. j. cancer 70:654–660, 1997. © 1997 wiley‐liss, inc.
a mitochondria-anchored isoform of the actin-nucleating spire protein regulates mitochondrial division masterminding mitochondrial fission mitochondria are highly dynamic and undergo fusion and fission and they move in cells. defects in mitochondrial dynamics are implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases. recent findings have suggested that mitochondrial fission occurs preferentially at endoplasmic reticulum (er) contact sites, with er circumscribing mitochondria and possibly promoting the constriction of mitochondria during fission. korobova et al. (p. 464) now suggest that an er-localized formin, inf2, is required for mitochondrial fission and that inf2-mediated actin polymerization facilitates mitochondrial constriction. actin filaments between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria promote mitochondrial fission. mitochondrial fission is fundamentally important to cellular physiology. the dynamin-related protein drp1 mediates fission, and interaction between mitochondrion and endoplasmic reticulum (er) enhances fission. however, the mechanism for drp1 recruitment to mitochondria is unclear, although previous results implicate actin involvement. here, we found that actin polymerization through er-localized inverted formin 2 (inf2) was required for efficient mitochondrial fission in mammalian cells. inf2 functioned upstream of drp1. actin filaments appeared to accumulate between mitochondria and inf2-enriched er membranes at constriction sites. thus, inf2-induced actin filaments may drive initial mitochondrial constriction, which allows drp1-driven secondary constriction. because inf2 mutations can lead to charcot-marie-tooth disease, our results provide a potential cellular mechanism for this disease state.
biodegradation in contaminated aquifers: incorporating microbial/molecular methods. stable isotope fractionation analysis of an aquifer heavily contaminated with benzene (up to 850 mg l(-1)) and toluene (up to 50 mg l(-1)) at a former hydrogenation plant in zeitz (saxonia, germany) has suggested that significant biodegradation of toluene was occurring. however, clear evidence of benzene biodegradation has been lacking at this site. determining the fate of benzene is often a determining factor in regulatory approval of a risk-based management strategy. the objective of the work described here was the demonstration of a new tool that can be used to provide proof of biodegradation of benzene or other organics by indigenous microorganisms under actual aquifer conditions. unique in situ biotraps containing bio-sep beads, amended with 13c-labeled or 12c nonlabeled benzene and toluene, were deployed at the zeitz site for 32 days in an existing groundwater monitoring well and used to collect and enrich microbial biofilms. lipid biomarkers or remaining substrate was extracted from the beads and analyzed by mass spectrometry and molecular methods. isotopic analysis of the remaining amounts of 13c-labeled contaminants (about 15-18% of the initial loading) showed no alteration of the 12c/13c ratio during incubation. therefore, no measurable exchange of labeled compounds in the beads by the nonlabeled compounds in the aquifer materials occurred. isotopic ratio analysis of microbial lipid fatty acids (as methyl ester derivatives) from labeled benzene- and toluene-amended biotraps showed 13c enrichment in several fatty acids of up to delta (13c) 13400%o, clearly verifying benzene and toluene biodegradation and the transformation of the labeled carbon into biomass by indigenous organisms under aquifer conditions. fatty acid profiles of total lipid fatty acids and the phospholipid fatty acid fraction and their isotopic composition showed significant differences between benzene- and toluene-amended biotraps, suggesting that different microbial communities were involved in the biodegradation of the two compounds.
nitric oxide activates superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase to repress the cell death induced by wounding congeners of nitrogen monoxide (no) are neuroprotective and neurodestructive1– 7. to address this apparent paradox, we considered the effects on neurons of compounds characterized by alternative redox states of no: nitric oxide (no.) and nitrosonium ion (no+)8. nitric oxide, generated from no. donors or synthesized endogenously after nmda (n-methyl-d-aspartate) receptor activation, can lead to neurotoxicity3,4. here, we report that no.-mediated neurotoxicity is engendered, at least in part, by reaction with superoxide anion (o.-2), apparently leading to formation of peroxynitrite (onoo−), and not by no. alone. in contrast, the neuroprotective effects of no result from downregulation of nmda-receptor activity by reaction with thiol group(s) of the receptor's redox modulatory site1. this reaction is not mediated by no. itself, but occurs under conditions supporting s-nitrosylation of nmda receptor thiol (reaction or transfer of no+). moreover, the redox versatility of no allows for its interconversion from neuroprotective to neurotoxic species by a change in the ambient redox milieu. the details of this complex redox chemistry of no may provide a mechanism for harnessing neuroprotective effects and avoiding neurotoxicity in the central nervous system.
towards a framework of digital platform competition: a comparative study of monopolistic & federated mobile payment platforms i this essay, we argue that pervasive digitization gives birth to a new type of product architecture: the layered modular architecture. the layered modular architecture extends the modular architecture of physical products by incorporating four loosely coupled layers of devices, networks, services, and contents created by digital technology. we posit that this new architecture instigates profound changes in the ways that firms organize for innovation in the future. we develop (1) a conceptual framework to describe the emerging organizing logic of digital innovation and (2) an information systems research agenda for digital strategy and the creation and management of corporate information technology infrastructures.

blind cfo estimation in ofdm systems using diagonality criterion this paper addresses the problem of joint channel and frequency offset estimation and tracking for ofdm systems. the proposed method is based on extended kalman filtering. the channel taps and the frequency offset are estimated in the time-domain while equalization is performed in the frequency domain. simulation results demonstrate accurate the tracking capability of the algorithm in scenarios when the channels are time-frequency selective. the frequency offset may be slowly or abruptly changing in time.
rna polymerase elongation factors. the universal bacterial transcription elongation factor nusa mediates elongation activities of rna polymerase. by itself, nusa induces transcription pausing and facilitates intrinsic termination, but nusa also is a cofactor of antiterminators that antagonize pausing and prevent termination. we show that nusa is required for lambda-related phage 82 antiterminator q(82) to construct a stable complex in which rna-based termination mechanisms have restricted access to the emerging transcript; this result suggests a locale for both q(82) and nusa near the beta flap domain of rna polymerase. furthermore, as nusa is not required for the antipausing activity of q(82) in vitro, we distinguish two distinct activities of antiterminators, namely antipausing and rna occlusion, and discuss their roles in q(82) function.
salesforce behavioural performance of accounts relationship managers (arms) in uganda's commercial banks: a qualitative analysis we introduce social networks theory and methods as a way of understanding mentoring in the current career context. we iirst introduce a typology of “developmental networks” using core concepts from social networks theory—network diversity and tie strength—to view mentoring as a multiple relationship phenomenon. we then propose a framework illustrating factors that shape developmental network structures and offer propositions focusing on the developmental consequences for individuals having different types of developmental networks in their careers. we conclude with strategies both for testing our propositions and for researching multiple developmental relationships further.
a path-based local search heuristic for the capacitated minimum spanning tree problem in recent years we have evidenced an extensive effort in the development of computer communication networks. one of the important aspects of the network design process is the solution of the topological design questions involved in establishing a communication network. in this article, formulations are presented for a variety of centralized network design problems such as the minimal spanning tree problem, capacitated and degree constrained minimal spanning tree problems, the telpak problem, and, heterogeneous network design problems. the applicability of these formulations to algorithmic development is demonstrated by developing an efficient algorithm for solving the degree constrained minimal spanning tree problem. computational results are reported for 630 test problems. a bender's decomposition procedure is developed and tested for the capacitated minimal spanning tree problem with less favorable results.
this information is current as exocytosis by networks of rab gtpases decoding the regulation of mast cell polarized response towards a contact interface is a common theme in intercellular signaling. to visualize spatial regulation of stimulated secretion within a contact region, we exposed ige-sensitized rat basophilic leukemia (rbl) mast cells to a surface that was patterned on the μm scale with hapten-containing lipid bilayers to activate cell surface ige-receptor complexes. we find that, within 10 minutes of stimulation, fusion of individual secretory lysosomes is targeted towards the cell-substrate interface, but is spatially segregated from the patterned bilayers and receptor signaling complexes. by contrast, stimulated outward trafficking of recycling endosomes is preferentially targeted towards the patterned bilayers. high spatial resolution of both antigen presentation in these arrays and detection of exocytotic events provides direct evidence for the heterogeneity of polarized responses.
angiotensin stimulates tgf-beta1 and clusterin in the hydronephrotic neonatal rat kidney. chronic unilateral ureteral obstruction (uuo) in early development activates the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system and leads to profound renal vasoconstriction, renal growth arrest, and interstitial fibrosis. to investigate the response of the at1 and at2 subtypes of the angiotensin ii (ang ii) receptors to uuo, sprague-dawley rats underwent uuo or control sham operation in the first 48 h of life and were studied 1-28 days later. renal mrna for renin, at1 and at2 receptor, and receptor binding and distribution were determined. in contrast to controls, renin mrna increased from 14 to 28 days in the obstructed kidney. after ipsilateral uuo, at1 mrna was suppressed at 1 day, but had increased compared with controls at 28 days. at2 receptor mrna fell rapidly in all kidneys from 1 to 3 days of age, after which it remained undetectable. compared with the intact opposite kidney, at2 mrna was suppressed in the obstructed kidney 1 day after uuo. compared with controls, at1 and at2 receptor binding was decreased by ipsilateral uuo at 1 day, whereas at1 binding was increased at 28 days. renal ang ii content was increased in the obstructed compared with the intact opposite kidney 28 days after uuo. in view of the increase in renal renin and angiotensin ii production resulting from uuo, increased renal at1 mrna and receptor binding are likely to contribute to the vasoconstriction and interstitial fibrosis of the neonatal kidney after prolonged uuo.
development and evaluation of the physical activity questionnaire for elderly japanese: the nakanojo study. we hypothesized that the health-related quality of life (hrqol) would be poorer in physically inactive older adults. this was tested in a sample of 73 male and 108 female free-living healthy japanese participants, age 65-85 years. we measured accelerometer step counts and their metabolic equivalents (mets) throughout each 24-hr period for 1 year. at the end of the year, hrqol was assessed. physical activity was grouped into quartiles. hrqol was poorer in the lowest quartiles of participants with respect to both step count and duration of activity >3 mets; however, our sample showed no better hrqol in those participants exceeding minimum standards of daily physical activity, corresponding to counts of around 5,500 and 4,500 steps/day and durations of around 13 and 14 min/day in men and women, respectively. causation cannot be demonstrated from this cross-sectional study, but nevertheless we suggest that elderly individuals should be encouraged to meet such standards of habitual physical activity.
fixed-dose versus off-label combination of isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine hydrochloride: retrospective propensity-matched analysis in black medicare patients with heart failure background although multiple therapies have been shown to lower mortality in patients with heart failure (hf) and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, their application in clinical practice has been less than ideal. to date, empiric estimation of the potential benefits that could be gained from eliminating these existing treatment gaps with optimal implementation has not been quantified.   methods eligibility criteria for each evidence-based hf therapy, the estimated frequency of use/nonuse of specific treatments, the case fatality rates, and the risk reductions due to treatment were obtained from published sources. the numbers of deaths prevented or postponed because of each guideline-recommended therapy and overall were determined.   results among patients with hf with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction in the united states (n = 2,644,800), the number eligible but not currently treated ranged from 139,749 for hydralazine/isorbide dinitrate to 852,512 for implantable cardioverter defibrillators. the comparative number of deaths that could potentially be prevented per year with optimal implementation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor antagonist is 6,516; β-blockers, 12,922; aldosterone antagonists, 21,407; hydralazine/isorbide dinitrate, 6,655; cardiac resynchronization therapy, 8,317; and implantable cardioverter defibrillators, 12,179. if these treatment benefits were additive, optimal implementation of all 6 therapies could potentially prevent 67,996 deaths a year.   conclusions a substantial number of hf deaths in this country could potentially be prevented by optimal implementation of evidence-based therapies. these data may underscore the importance of performance improvement efforts to translate evidence-based therapy to routine clinical practice so as to reduce contemporary hf mortality.
successful treatment of children in clinical practice relies on the ability of the dental practitioner to guide them through their dental experiences autonomic and behavioral responses to seven dental procedures were studied in 21 pedodontic patients aged six to 12. when mean pulse rate, pulse amplitude, absolute skin conductance, and skin-conductance responses were compared over all subjects, the injection of the local anesthetic consistently elicited the greatest response. in five patients where anesthesia was inadequate, painful high-speed drilling also elicited large responses. when autonomic responses were compared between high-anxious and low-anxious children, both groups showed similar transient responsiveness. high-anxious children showed a significantly higher basal level of sympathetic activity.
the effect of dietary fat intake on hepatic gene expression in lg/j and sm/j mice objective to examine the differential response of obesity- and diabetes-related traits to a high- or low-fat diet in lg/j and sm/j mice. we also examined food consumption in these strains.   research methods and procedures mice were placed on a high- or low-fat diet after weaning. animals were weighed once per week and subjected to glucose tolerance tests at 20 weeks. at sacrifice, fat pads and internal organs were removed along with serum samples. for food consumption, lg/j and sm/j mice of each sex were assigned to a high-fat or low-fat diet after reaching maturity. mice were weighed three times per week, and food consumed was determined by subtraction.   results lg/j animals consume more total food, but sm/j animals consume more food per gram of body weight. lg/j mice grow faster to 10 weeks but slower from 10 to 20 weeks, have higher cholesterol and free fatty acid levels, and have lower basal glucose levels and better response to a glucose challenge than sm/j mice. for most traits, sm/j mice respond more strongly to a high-fat diet than lg/j mice, including body weight and growth, basal glucose levels, organ weights, fat distribution, and circulating triglycerides and cholesterol levels.   discussion obesity-related phenotypes, as well as response to increased dietary fat, differ genetically between lg/j and sm/j and can, therefore, be mapped. this study indicates that the cross of sm/j and lg/j mice would be an excellent model system for the study of gene-by-diet interaction in obesity.
on the portability of trained machine learning classifiers for early application identification the early detection of applications associated with tcp flows is an essential step for network security and traffic engineering. the classic way to identify flows, i.e. looking at port numbers, is not effective anymore. on the other hand, state-of-the-art techniques cannot determine the application before the end of the tcp flow. in this editorial, we propose a technique that relies on the observation of the first five packets of a tcp connection to identify the application. this result opens a range of new possibilities for online traffic classification.
findings from positron emission tomography and genetic analyses for cerebellar liponeurocytoma a 42-year-old woman had suffered from headaches since april 2009. computed tomography revealed a tumor with marked calcification in the left frontal lobe adjacent to the left anterior horn of the lateral ventricle. t1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging showed a well-enhanced tumor at the lesion. dynamic methionine positron emission tomography showed no delayed methionine attenuation. initial preoperative diagnosis was extraventricular neurocytoma (evn). however, oligodendroglioma was determined upon a second diagnosis. the patient underwent total tumor removal. hematoxylin and eosin staining showed the characteristic fried egg-like cells, round nuclei, and immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein, synaptophysin, neuronal nuclear antigen, microtubule-associated protein 2 and olig2. the mib-1 labeling index was 20%, which suggested malignancy. although these findings demonstrated that the tumor had glioneuronal character, it was difficult to differentiate between evn and oligodendroglioma. there have been reports that olig2 immunohistochemistry is generally positive in cases of oligodendroglioma, but not in cases of neurocytoma. we completed the diagnosis as oligodendroglioma. subsequent electron microscopy results presented oligodendroglial but not neuronal characteristics. we concluded that olig2 is useful in the differential diagnosis of oligodendrogliomas and evns.
use of hf20 membrane in critically ill unstable low-body-weight infants on inotropic support background critically ill children with hemodynamic instability and acute kidney injury often develop fluid overload. continuous renal replacement therapy (crrt) has emerged as a favored modality in the management of such children. this study investigated the association between fluid overload and mortality in children receiving crrt.   study design prospective observational study.   setting & participants 297 children from 13 centers across the united states participating in the prospective pediatric crrt registry.   predictor fluid overload from intensive care unit (icu) admission to crrt initiation, defined as a percentage equal to (fluid in [l] - fluid out [l])/(icu admit weight [kg]) x 100%.   outcome & measurements the primary outcome was survival to pediatric icu discharge. data were collected regarding demographics, crrt parameters, underlying disease process, and severity of illness.   results 153 patients (51.5%) developed < 10% fluid overload, 51 patients (17.2%) developed 10%-20% fluid overload, and 93 patients (31.3%) developed > or = 20% fluid overload. patients who developed > or = 20% fluid overload at crrt initiation had significantly higher mortality (61/93; 65.6%) than those who had 10%-20% fluid overload (22/51; 43.1%) and those with < 10% fluid overload (45/153; 29.4%). the association between degree of fluid overload and mortality remained after adjusting for intergroup differences and severity of illness. the adjusted mortality or was 1.03 (95% ci, 1.01-1.05), suggesting a 3% increase in mortality for each 1% increase in severity of fluid overload. when fluid overload was dichotomized to > or = 20% and < 20%, patients with > or = 20% fluid overload had an adjusted mortality or of 8.5 (95% ci, 2.8-25.7).   limitations this was an observational study; interventions were not standardized. the relationship between fluid overload and mortality remains an association without definitive evidence of causality.   conclusions critically ill children who develop greater fluid overload before initiation of crrt experience higher mortality than those with less fluid overload. further goal-directed research is required to accurately define optimal fluid overload thresholds for initiation of crrt.
modulation of synaptic transmission by the bcl-2 family protein bcl-xl the diffusion of metabolites across the outer mitochondrial membrane is essential for coupled cellular respiration. the outer membrane of mitochondria isolated from growth factor-deprived cells is impaired in its ability to exchange metabolic anions. when added to mitochondria, recombinant bcl-xl restores metabolite exchange across the outer membrane without inducing the loss of cytochrome c from the intermembrane space. restoration of outer membrane permeability to anionic metabolites does not occur directly through bcl-xlion channels. instead, recombinant bcl-xl maintains the outer mitochondrial membrane channel, vdac, in an open configuration. consistent with these findings, when adp-induced oxidative phosphorylation is limited by exogenous β-nadh, recombinant bcl-xl can sustain outer mitochondrial membrane permeability to adp. β-nadh limits respiration by promoting the closed configuration of vdac. together these results demonstrate that following an apoptotic signal, bcl-xl can maintain metabolite exchange across the outer mitochondrial membrane by inhibiting vdac closure.
single-photon techniques for standard cmos digital ics photon counting is useful in space-based imagers wherever quantitative light-intensity evaluation is necessary. various types of radiation, from cosmic rays to high-energy proton beams to gamma radiation, have an effect on the functionality and accuracy of imagers and the literature is extensive [1,2]. techniques to maximize sensor tolerance have also been developed for a number of years and several imagers resistant to up to 30mrad (si) of gamma radiation have been reported. these sensors have several shortcomings: either significant noise performance degradation, up to several orders of magnitude [2], or unacceptably high pre-radiation noise levels [3]. in addition, many radiation-tolerant sensors use dedicated processes, thus possibly limiting their suitability for mass-market applications [4].
brown adipose tissue can be activated or inhibited within an hour before 18f-fdg injection: a preliminary study with micropet obligatory thermogenesis is a necessary accompaniment of all metabolic processes involved in maintenance of the body in the living state, and occurs in all organs. it includes energy expenditure involved in ingesting, digesting, and processing food (thermic effect of food (tef]. at certain life stages extra energy expenditure for growth, pregnancy, or lactation would also be obligatory. facultative thermogenesis is superimposed on obligatory thermogenesis and can be rapidly switched on and rapidly suppressed by the nervous system. facultative thermogenesis is important in both thermal balance, in which control of thermoregulatory thermogenesis (shivering in muscle, nonshivering in brown adipose tissue (bat] balances neural control of heat loss mechanisms, and in energy balance, in which control of facultative thermogenesis (exercise-induced in muscle, diet-induced thermogenesis (dit) in bat) balances control of energy intake. thermal balance (i.e., body temperature) is much more stringently controlled than energy balance (i.e., body energy stores). reduced energy expenditure for thermogenesis is important in two types of obesity in laboratory animals. in the first type, deficient dit in bat is a prominent feature of altered energy balance. it may or may not be associated with hyperphagia. in a second type, reduced cold-induced thermogenesis in bat as well as in other organs is a prominent feature of altered thermal balance. this in turn results in altered energy balance and obesity, exacerbated in some examples by hyperphagia. in some of the hyperphagic obese animals it is likely that the exaggerated obligatory thermic effect of food so alters thermal balance that bat thermogenesis is suppressed. in all obese animals, deficient hypothalamic control of facultative thermogenesis and (or) food intake is implicated.
understanding monitoring technologies for adults with pain: systematic literature review context: testing plays an important role in the quality assurance process for software product line engineering. there are many opportunities for economies of scope and scale in the testing activities, but techniques that can take advantage of these opportunities are still needed. objective: the objective of this study is to identify testing strategies that have the potential to achieve these economies, and to provide a synthesis of available research on spl testing strategies, to be applied towards reaching higher defect detection rates and reduced quality assurance effort. method: we performed a literature review of two hundred seventy-six studies published from the year 1998 up to the 1st semester of 2013. we used several filters to focus the review on the most relevant studies and we give detailed analyses of the core set of studies. results: the analysis of the reported strategies comprised two fundamental aspects for software product line testing: the selection of products for testing, and the actual test of products. our findings indicate that the literature offers a large number of techniques to cope with such aspects. however, there is a lack of reports on realistic industrial experiences, which limits the inferences that can be drawn. conclusion: this study showed a number of leveraged strategies that can support both the selection of products, and the actual testing of products. future research should also benefit from the problems and advantages identified in this study.
systematic review of factors influencing length of stay in icu after adult cardiac surgery objective:followingcardiacsurgery, agreat varietyinintensivecareunit(icu)stayis observed,makingitoftendifficulttoadequatelypredict icu stay preoperatively. therefore, a study was conducted to investigate, which preoperative variables are independent risk factors for a prolonged icu stay and whether a patient’s risk of experiencing an extended icu stay can be estimated from these predictors. methods: the records of 1566 consecutive adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery at our institution were analysed retrospectively over a 2-year period. procedures included in the analyses were coronary artery bypass grafting, valve replacement or repair, ascending and aortic arch surgery, ventricular rupture and aneurysm repair, septal myectomy and cardiac tumour surgery. for this patient group, icu stay was registered and 57 preoperative variables were collected for analysis. descriptives and log-rank tests were calculated and kaplan—meier curves drawn for all variables. significant predictors in the univariate analyses were included in a cox proportional hazards model. the definitive model was validated on an independent sample of 395 consecutive adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery at our institution over an additional 6-month period. in this patient group, the accuracy and discriminative abilities of the model were evaluated. results: twelve independent preoperative predictors of prolonged icu stay were identified: age at surgery > 75 years, female gender, dyspnoea status > new york heart association class ii (nyha ii), unstable symptoms, impaired kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (egfr) colour flow mapping (cfm) grade ii, inotropic support, intra-aortic balloon pumping (iabp), non-elective procedures and aortic surgery. the individual effect of every predictor on icu stay was quantified and inserted into a mathematical algorithm (called the morbidity defining cardiosurgical (mdc) index), making it possible to calculate a patient’s risk of having an extended icu stay. the model showed very good calibration and very good to excellent discriminative ability in predicting icu stay >2, >5 and >7 days (c-statistic of 0.78; 0.82 and 0.85, respectively). conclusions: twelve independent preoperative risk factors for a prolonged icu stay following cardiac surgery were identified and constructed into a proportional hazards model. using this risk model, one can predict whether a patient will have a prolonged icu stay or not. # 2010 european association for cardio-thoracic surgery. published by elsevier b.v. all rights reserved.
phylogenetic information and experimental design in molecular systematics summarythe application of maximum likelihood techniques to the estimation of evolutionary trees from nucleic acid sequence data is discussed. a computationally feasible method for finding such maximum likelihood estimates is developed, and a computer program is available. this method has advantages over the traditional parsimony algorithms, which can give misleading results if rates of evolution differ in different lineages. it also allows the testing of hypotheses about the constancy of evolutionary rates by likelihood ratio tests, and gives rough indication of the error of the estimate of the tree.
factors affecting unmet need for family planning in southern nations, nationalities and peoples region, ethiopia the southern nations, nationalities, and people's region of ethiopia (snnpr) is home to 11 million people constituting more than 45 language and ethnic groups, most of whom live in extremely poor rural communities. data for currently married, fecund women aged 15-49 from demographic surveys conducted in the snnpr in 1990 and 1997 are used to investigate contraceptive knowledge and communication, and the use and future need for family planning services in this population. this study focuses on how these processes are affected by household organization and women's status, and on their implications for population policies and programs. considerations of the implications of these results for understanding the fertility transition of a highly diverse african population under severe stress are presented. although household extension and polygamy characterize one-third of the women sampled, they do not affect the women's contraceptive behavior. women's literacy and autonomy are, by far, the most significant forces in the movement toward lower fertility in the region.
time and frequency localized pulse shape for resolution enhancement in stft-botdr brillouin scattering in optical fiber describes the interaction of an electro-magnetic field (photon) with a characteristic density variation of the fiber. when the electric field amplitude of an optical beam (so-called pump wave), and another wave is introduced at the downshifted brillouin frequency (namely stokes wave), the beating between the pump and stokes waves creates a modified density change via the electrostriction effect, resulting in so-called the stimulated brillouin scattering. the density variation is associated with a mechanical acoustic wave; and it may be affected by local temperature, strain, and vibration which induce changes in the fiber effective refractive index and sound velocity. through the measurement of the static or dynamic changes in brillouin frequency along the fiber one can realize a distributed fiber sensor for local temperature, strain and vibration over tens or hundreds of kilometers. this paper reviews the progress on improving sensing performance parameters like spatial resolution, sensing length limitation and simultaneous temperature and strain measurement. these kinds of sensors can be used in civil structural monitoring of pipelines, bridges, dams, and railroads for disaster prevention. analogous to the static bragg grating, one can write a moving brillouin grating in fibers, with the lifetime of the acoustic wave. the length of the brillouin grating can be controlled by the writing pulses at any position in fibers. such gratings can be used to measure changes in birefringence, which is an important parameter in fiber communications. applications for this kind of sensor can be found in aerospace, material processing and fine structures.
whole proteome identification of plant candidate g-protein coupled receptors in arabidopsis, rice, and poplar: computational prediction and in-vivo protein coupling heterotrimeric g proteins couple seven-transmembrane receptors for diverse extracellular signals to effectors that generate intracellular signals altering cell function. mutations in the gene encoding the alpha subunit of the g protein-coupling receptors to stimulation of adenylyl cyclase cause developmental abnormalities of bone, as well as hormone resistance (pseudohypoparathyroidism caused by loss-of-function mutations) and hormone hypersecretion (mccune-albright syndrome caused by gain-of-function mutations). loss- and gain-of-function mutations in genes encoding g protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs) have been identified as the cause of an increasing number of retinal, endocrine, metabolic, and developmental disorders. gpcrs comprise an evolutionarily conserved gene superfamily ( 1 ). by coupling to heterotrimeric g proteins, gpcrs transduce a wide variety of extracellular signals including monoamine, amino acid, and nucleoside neurotransmitters, as well as photons, chemical odorants, divalent cations, hormones, lipids, peptides and proteins. following a brief overview of g protein-coupled signal transduction, we review the growing body of evidence that mutations in genes encoding gpcrs and g proteins are an important cause of human disease.
outreach and support in south london (oasis). outcomes of non-attenders to a service for people at high risk of psychosis: the case for a more assertive approach to assessment. background while recent research points to the potential benefits of clinical intervention before the first episode of psychosis, the logistical feasibility of this is unclear.   aims to assess the feasibility of providing a clinical service for people with prodromal symptoms in an inner city area where engagement with mental health services is generally poor.   method following a period of liaison with local agencies to promote the service, referrals were assessed and managed in a primary care setting. activity of the service was audited over 30 months.   results people with prodromal symptoms were referred by a range of community agencies and seen at their local primary care physician practice. over 30 months, 180 clients were referred; 58 (32.2%) met criteria for an at risk mental state, most of whom (67.2%) had attenuated psychotic symptoms. almost 30% were excluded due to current or previous psychotic illness, of which two-thirds were in the first episode of psychosis. the socio-demographic composition of the 'at risk' group reflected that of the local population, with an over-representation of clients from an ethnic minority. over 90% of suitable clients remained engaged with the service after 1 year.   conclusion it is feasible to provide a clinical service for people with prodromal symptoms in a deprived inner city area with a large ethnic minority population.
atp hydrolysis provides functions that promote rejection of pairings between different copies of long repeated sequences ideally, self-assembly should rapidly and efficiently produce stable correctly assembled structures. we study the tradeoff between enthalpic and entropic cost in self-assembling systems using reca-mediated homology search as an example. earlier work suggested that reca searches could produce stable final structures with high stringency using a slow testing process that follows an initial rapid search of ∼9-15 bases. in this work, we will show that as a result of entropic and enthalpic barriers, simultaneously testing all ∼9-15 bases as separate individual units results in a longer overall searching time than testing them in groups and stages.
assessing potential vulnerability and response of fish to simulated avian predation after exposure to psychotropic pharmaceuticals pharmaceuticals in the environment (pie) are of importance since these compounds are designed to affect biological receptors/enzymes that are often conserved across vertebrate families. across-species extrapolation of these therapeutic targets suggests potential for impacting amphibia and fish in the aquatic environment. due to the scarcity of relevant ecotoxicological data, the long-tem impact of pie remains a research question. efficient use of mammalian data has been proposed to better understand and predict the potential for a given pharmaceutical to impact the environment. using a model cardiovascular pharmaceutical (propranolol, a non-specific beta(1)/beta(2)-adrenergic antagonist), the hypothesis that mammalian data can be used to predict toxicity in fish was tested. rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss (walbaum)) have beta-adrenergic signalling mechanisms analogous to human cardiovascular receptors that respond to pharmacological doses of agonists and antagonists. trout absorbed propranolol from water such that after 40 days of exposure, the linear relationship was [plasma] - 0.59[water] (n - 31, r - 0.96). growth rate was affected only at very high aqueous concentrations (10-day (growth)noec - 1.0 and (growth)loec - 10 mg/l). growth recovered with time (40-day (growth)noec - 10 mg/l), suggesting possible adaptation to the pharmaceutical, although the internal plasma concentration in trout exposed to 10mg propranolol/l of water was higher than the mammalian therapeutic plasma concentration. additional endpoints suggested subtle changes of liver and heart size at much lower concentrations may have occurred, although these were not concentration-related. there was, however, a dose-dependent effect upon overall body condition. the trout plasma concentrations at these effective aqueous concentrations fell within the range of mammalian effective plasma concentrations, supporting the potential for developing 'read-across' from mammalian pharmacology safety data to fish ecotoxicology. despite these effects at relatively high concentrations, propranolol is not expected to pose a risk to fish at the concentrations considered to be present in the aquatic environment.
finite element modeling of short-wavelength folding on venus: implications for the plume hypothesis for crustal plateau formation crustal plateaus on venus constitute one of that planet’s most intriguing tectonic features. they host so-called “tessera” terrain, or deformed crust exhibiting two or more sets of intersecting tectonic lineaments, which comprises»8% of venus’ surface. major questions surrounding crustal plateaus and tessera terrain include: (1) what is the nature of crustal plateau deformation? what structures are present, and what are their spatial and temporal relations? (2) what is the global distribution of tessera terrain? does it form a global layer under the regional plains, cropping out in crustal plateaus, or is it confined to crustal plateaus? and (3) what are the implications of (1) and (2) for understanding the processes responsible for formation and deformation of crustal plateaus? structural and kinematic analyses reveal that deformation at ovda regio, venus largest crustal plateau, is characterized by linear shallow steep-sided troughs (ribbons), long arcuate long-wavelength folds, short mid-wavelength folds, and wide complex graben. temporal relations between structures lead to a three-phase regional strain history consisting of (1) layer-normal flattening of a thin competent membrane resulting in radially oriented, distributed extension (ribbon formation); (2) modest contraction of a thicker layer (concentric folding at plateau margins, interference folding in the plateau interior); and (3) limited extension localized at fold crests (graben formation). wavelength analysis of ribbons and folds places limits on the thickness of the competent layer during each stage of deformation and reflects an early shallow brittle‐ductile transition (bdt) that deepened with time. ovda’s deformation, topography, and gravity are all spatially correlated, strongly suggesting a genetic relationship between surface deformation and processes causing crustal thickening and plateau uplift. thus tessera terrain at ovda regio is likely confined to the topographically high plateau and does not extend beneath the surrounding regional plains. similar patterns persist at other crustal plateaus, indicating that tessera terrain is in general confined to crustal plateaus and does not form a globally continuous layer. ovda’s structures, their spatial and temporal relations, the resulting strain history, and the behavior of the bdt through time support a model of mantle plume upwelling in a thin lithospheric regime for crustal plateau formation and contradict previous downwelling models. similarities between structural and kinematic trends at ovda regio and other crustal plateaus lend support to this idea. c ∞ 1999 academic press
strategies for mining fungal natural products loss-of-function aspergillus nidulans ccla, a bre2 ortholog involved in histone h3 lysine 4 methylation, activated the expression of cryptic secondary metabolite clusters in a. nidulans. one new cluster generated monodictyphenone, emodin and emodin derivatives, whereas a second encoded two anti-osteoporosis polyketides, f9775a and f9775b. modification of the chromatin landscape in fungal secondary metabolite clusters allows for a simple technological means to express silent fungal secondary metabolite gene clusters.
variance-sensitive choice in lemurs: constancy trumps quantity the last decade's lemur research includes successes in discovering new living and extinct species and learning about the distribution, biogeography, physiology, behavior, and ecology of previously little-studied species. in addition, in both the dry forest and rain forest, long-term studies of lemur demography, life history, and reproduction, have been completed in conjunction with data on tree productivity, phenology, and climate. lemurs contrast with anthropoids in several behavioral features, including female dominance, targeted female-female aggression, lack of sexual dimorphism regardless of mating system, sperm competition coupled with male-male aggression, high infant mortality, cathemerality, and strict seasonal breeding. hypotheses to explain these traits include the "energy conservation hypothesis" (ech) suggesting that harsh and unpredictable climate factors on the island of madagascar have affected the evolution of female dominance, and the "evolutionary disequilibrium hypotheses" (evdh) suggesting that the recent megafauna extinctions have influenced lemurs to become diurnal. these hypotheses are compared and contrasted in light of recent empirical data on climate, subfossils, and lemur behavior. new data on life histories of the rain forest lemurs at ranomafana national park give further support to the ech. birth seasons are synchronized within each species, but there is a 6-month distribution of births among species. gestation and lactation lengths vary among sympatric lemurs, but all lemur species in the rain forest wean in synchrony at the season most likely to have abundant resources. across-species weaning synchrony seen in ranomafana corroborates data from the dry forest that late lactation and weaning is the life history event that is the primary focus of the annual schedule. lemur adaptations may assure maximum offspring survival in this environment with an unpredictable food supply and heavy predation. in conclusion, a more comprehensive energy frugality hypothesis (efh) is proposed, which postulates that the majority of lemur traits are either adaptations to conserve energy (e.g., low basal metabolic rate (bmr), torpor, sperm competition, small group size, seasonal breeding) or to maximize use of scarce resources (e.g., cathemerality, territoriality, female dominance, fibrous diet, weaning synchrony). among primates, the isolated adaptive radiation of lemurs on madagascar may have been uniquely characterized by selection toward efficiency to cope with the harsh and unpredictable island environment.
rheumatologic emergencies background: primary cns vasculitis (pcnsv) is an uncommon disease in which lesions are limited to the brain and spinal cord. our objective was to evaluate the frequency, clinical features, and outcome of spinal cord involvement in pcnsv. methods: we retrospectively identified 101 consecutive patients with pcnsv. spinal cord involvement was documented for five. clinical findings, laboratory studies, and outcomes of patients with spinal cord involvement were assessed and compared with those without spinal cord manifestations. results: spinal cord symptoms developed before cerebral symptoms in one patient, concurrently in two, and after cerebral symptoms in two. cns biopsy specimens showed necrotizing vasculitis in three patients and granulomatous vasculitis in two. mri of the spinal cord showed enhanced thoracic lesions in all five. cerebral angiograms from four patients had normal findings. one patient had a fatal clinical course. the other four had relapses during follow-up but responded well to therapy and had favorable overall outcomes. at the last follow-up (median, 19 months after diagnosis), the four patients had recovered with slight or moderate residual disability. no significant differences in clinical and laboratory features were observed when comparing patients with or without spinal cord involvement. cerebral angiograms with evidence of vasculitis were significantly more frequent for patients without spinal cord involvement (p = 0.002). conclusion: spinal cord involvement was documented in 5% of patients with primary cns vasculitis. the thoracic cord was the predominantly affected site. other than myelopathy, clinical characteristics were similar to those of the patients without spinal cord involvement. glossary: atm = acute transverse myelitis; esr = erythrocyte sedimentation rate; nd = no data; pcnsv = primary cns vasculitis; wbc = white blood cells.
interleukin-1 participates in the progression from liver injury to fibrosis. both the identity and source of the rodent collagenase(s) that mediates matrix remodeling in liver fibrosis remain elusive. we have recently demonstrated an unequivocal role for scar-associated macrophages (sams) in the spontaneous resolution of liver fibrosis and sought to determine whether sams are the source of matrix metalloproteinase (mmp) 13 (collagenase 3), considered to be the primary interstitial collagenase in rodents. in this study, we demonstrate an association between mmp13 expression and the presence of sams in the regression of experimental liver fibrosis. mmp13 gene expression was restricted to regions of fibrosis that were rich in sams. both mmp13 mrna and protein colocalized to large phagocytes within and directly apposed to hepatic scars. using the cd11b-dtr-transgenic mouse to deplete sams in a model of chronic ccl4 injury, we found that sam depletion resulted in a 5-fold reduction in mmp13 message (p = 0.005). furthermore, resolution of ccl4-induced fibrosis was retarded in mmp13-deficient mice. thus, sams selectively, during resolution of fibrosis induce and use the major collagenase mmp13 to mediate the resorption of interstitial matrix and successfully remodel the fibrotic liver.
pkcη regulates the tgfβ3-induced chondevrepogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cell protein kinase c eta (pkceta) is one of several pkc isoforms found in humans. it is a novel pkc isoform in that it is activated by diacylglycerol and anionic phospholipids but not calcium. the crystal structure of the pkceta-c2 domain, which is thought to mediate anionic phospholipid sensing in the protein, was determined at 1.75 a resolution. the structure is similar to that of the pkc epsilon c2 domain but with significant variations at the putative lipid-binding site. two serine residues within pkc eta were identified in vitro as potential autophosphorylation sites. in the unphosphorylated structure both serines line the putative lipid-binding site and may therefore play a role in the lipid-regulation of the kinase.
the association between socioeconomic status and visual impairments among primary glaucoma: the results from nationwide korean national health insurance cohort from 2004 to 2013 purpose. to estimate the prevalence of glaucoma and costs associated with glaucoma care in south korea between 2008 and 2013 using the korean national claims database. design. retrospective cross-sectional study from a national claims database. methods. patients who were diagnosed with glaucoma between 2008 and 2013 were retrospectively identified in the national claims database using glaucoma diagnostic codes. for each year, the prevalence of glaucoma and direct medical costs associated with glaucoma care were estimated. result. the prevalence of glaucoma in patients ≥40 years of age increased from 0.79% in 2008 to 1.05% in 2013. the number of patients with glaucoma increased by 54% between 2008 and 2013 (9% average annual increase). the prevalence of glaucoma increased with age and was higher in males than in females. the cost to care for glaucoma patients increased from $16.5 million in 2008 to $29.2 million in 2013, which translated into an 81% increase over the 6 years examined (12.7% average annual increase). conclusion. the estimated prevalence and socioeconomic burden of glaucoma have steadily increased each year in south korea. nevertheless, many glaucoma patients remain undiagnosed in the present study using national claims database.
the properties and utility of the core measure of melancholia. background several studies have recognized that depression is a multidimensional construct, although the scales that are currently available have been shown to be limited in terms of the ability to investigate the multidimensionality of depression. the objective of this study is to integrate information from instruments that measure depression from different perspectives–a self-report symptomatic scale, a clinician-rated scale, and a clinician-rated scale of depressive signs–in order to investigate the multiple dimensions underlying the depressive construct. methods a sample of 399 patients from a mood disorders outpatient unit was investigated with the beck depression inventory (bdi), the hamilton depression rating scale (hdrs), and the core assessment of psychomotor change (core). exploratory factor analysis (efa) and confirmatory factor analysis (cfa) were used to investigate underlying dimensions of depression, including item level analysis with factor loadings and item thresholds. results a solution of six depression dimensions has shown good-fit to the data, with no cross-loading items, and good interpretability. item-level analysis revealed that the multidimensional depressive construct might be organized into a continuum of severity in the following ascending order: sexual, cognitive, insomnia, appetite, non-interactiveness/motor retardation, and agitation. conclusion an integration of both signs and symptoms, as well as the perspectives of clinicians and patients, might be a good clinical and research alternative for the investigation of multidimensional issues within the depressive syndrome. as predicted by theoretical models of depression, the melancholic aspects of depression (non-interactiveness/motor retardation and agitation) lie at the severe end of the depressive continuum.
ultrasonic vocalization in the common marmoset ( callithrix jacchus ) the general concept of animal welfare embraces a continuum between negative/bad welfare and positive/good welfare. early approaches to defining animal welfare were mainly based on the exclusion of negative states, neglecting the fact that during evolution animals optimised their ability to interact with and adapt to their environment(s). an animal's welfare status might best be represented by the adaptive value of the individual's interaction with a given environmental setting but this dynamic welfare concept has significant implications for practical welfare assessments. animal welfare issues cannot simply be addressed by means of objective biological measurements of an animal's welfare status under certain circumstances. in practice, interpretation of welfare status and its translation into the active management of perceived welfare issues are both strongly influenced by context and, especially, by cultural and societal values. in assessing whether or not a given welfare status is morally acceptable, animal welfare scientists must be aware that scientifically based, operational definitions of animal welfare will necessarily be influenced strongly by a given society's moral understanding.
ophthalmological assessment of cannabis-induced persisting perception disorder: is there a direct retinal effect? the naka-rushton equation empirically describes the amplitude r of the darkadapted electroretinogram b-wave, as a function of stimulus luminance l, asr/rmax = ln/(ln +kn). estimating the three parametersrmax,n, andk of this function from electroretinogram data is of both experimental and clinical interest. several different approaches have been developed to accomplish this analysis, but these approaches may derive different estimates of the three parameters. to examine this possibility, we compared the results of three methods of fitting the naka-rushton equation to data sets obtained from 30 normal subjects. two methods were nonlinear curve-fitting programs; the third method involved fitting a regression line to transformed data. the results indicate that solutions provided by these methods have consistent differences, which may be an important consideration when comparing results reported in studies that used different curve-fitting methods.
ptov1 is associated with uch-l1 and in response to estrogen stimuli during the mouse oocyte development abstract ptov1 is a mitogenic protein that shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in a cell cycle-dependent manner. it consists of two homologous domains arranged in tandem that constitute a new class of protein modules. we show here that ptov1 interacts with the lipid raft protein flotillin-1, with which it copurifies in detergent-insoluble floating fractions. flotillin-1 colocalized with ptov1 not only at the plasma membrane but, unexpectedly, also in the nucleus, as demonstrated by immunocytochemistry and subcellular fractionation of endogenous and exogenous flotillin-1. flotillin-1 entered the nucleus concomitant with ptov1, shortly before the initiation of the s phase. protein levels of ptov1 and flotillin-1 oscillated during the cell cycle, with a peak in s. depletion of ptov1 significantly inhibited nuclear localization of flotillin-1, whereas depletion of flotillin-1 did not affect nuclear localization of ptov1. depletion of either protein markedly inhibited cell proliferation under basal conditions. overexpression of ptov1 or flotillin-1 strongly induced proliferation, which required their localization to the nucleus, and was dependent on the reciprocal protein. these observations suggest that ptov1 assists flotillin-1 in its translocation to the nucleus and that both proteins are required for cell proliferation.
comparison of dilution, filtration, and microwave digestion sample pretreatments in elemental profiling of wine by icp-ms the analysis of wine is of great importance since wine components strongly determine its stability, organoleptic or nutrition characteristics. in addition, wine analysis is also important to prevent fraud and to assess toxicological issues. among the different analytical techniques described in the literature, atomic spectrometry has been traditionally employed for elemental wine analysis due to its simplicity and good analytical figures of merit. the scope of this review is to summarize the main advantages and drawbacks of various atomic spectrometry techniques for elemental wine analysis. special attention is paid to interferences (i.e. matrix effects) affecting the analysis as well as the strategies available to mitigate them. finally, latest studies about wine speciation are briefly discussed.
front-face fluorescence spectroscopy as a tool to classify seven bovine muscles according to their chemical and rheological characteristics. this paper reports the potential of synchronous front-face fluorescence spectroscopy in the characterization at the molecular level of milk changes during mild heating from 4 to 50 °c and acidification in the ph range of 6.8 to 5.1. synchronous fluorescence spectra were collected in the 250–550 nm excitation wavelength range using offsets of 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, and 240 nm between excitation and emission monochromators. the potential of parallel factor (parafac) analysis in the decomposition of the whole synchronous fluorescence data set into the contribution of each of the fluorescent compounds present in milk has been investigated for heating and acidification data sets. models were fitted from 1 to 7 components. considering the core consistency values, parafac models with three components have been considered. the first three components explained 94.43% and 94.13% of the total variance for heating and acidification data sets, respectively. the loading profiles of the first and second components derived from parafac analysis performed on heating and acidification data sets corresponded quite well with the characteristics of tryptophan and vitamin a fluorescence spectra, respectively. the third component corresponded to the riboflavin fluorescence spectrum. considering the heating experiment, the profile of the concentration mode for the second component showed large variations according to the temperature, which were assigned to the melting of triglycerides between 4 and 50 °c. for the acidification experiment, drastic changes in the concentration modes of the three components were observed for ph below 5.6, in agreement with structural changes in casein micelles.
abnormal default-mode network homogeneity in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) studies have demonstrated that the resting state networks (rsns) are impaired in various neuropsychiatric disorders. however, little is known about the changes in the functional architecture of the rsns in idiopathic generalized epilepsy patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures (gtcs). resting state fmri data were acquired from 16 gtcs patients and 16 healthy subjects. the data were acquired during interictal without combined eeg confirmation. functional connectivity among the rsns was examined using individual-based independent component analysis. six rsns were identified in both the gtcs and control groups. compared with the healthy subjects, decreased functional connectivity in the self-referential, somatosensory, visual, and auditory networks, and both the decreased and increased functional connectivities in the classic default-mode and dorsal attention networks were found in the gtcs patients. furthermore, the present study revealed a negative correlation between the seizure duration and functional connectivity changes in the medial prefrontal cortex in the gtcs patients. these results indicate that there are impairments in the rsns and possible reorganization of the default-mode network and dorsal attention network in patients with gtcs. our findings may also suggest that the medial prefrontal cortex and its associated network play a role in the development of gtcs.
characterization of the growth dynamics and biofilm formation of staphylococcus epidermidis strains isolated from contaminated platelet units. background: septic reactions continue to be reported with culture‐tested platelet (plt) products, probably due to false‐negative results associated with inadequate sampling of low‐concentration bacteria. the mechanism of test failure was modeled and false‐negative rates were estimated utilizing published data.
kernel conditional exponential family in this paper, we consider an infinite dimensional exponential family, $\mathcal{p}$ of probability densities, which are parametrized by functions in a reproducing kernel hilbert space, $h$ and show it to be quite rich in the sense that a broad class of densities on $\mathbb{r}^d$ can be approximated arbitrarily well in kullback-leibler (kl) divergence by elements in $\mathcal{p}$. the main goal of the paper is to estimate an unknown density, $p_0$ through an element in $\mathcal{p}$. standard techniques like maximum likelihood estimation (mle) or pseudo mle (based on the method of sieves), which are based on minimizing the kl divergence between $p_0$ and $\mathcal{p}$, do not yield practically useful estimators because of their inability to efficiently handle the log-partition function. instead, we propose an estimator, $\hat{p}_n$ based on minimizing the \emph{fisher divergence}, $j(p_0\vert p)$ between $p_0$ and $p\in \mathcal{p}$, which involves solving a simple finite-dimensional linear system. when $p_0\in\mathcal{p}$, we show that the proposed estimator is consistent, and provide a convergence rate of $n^{-\min\left\{\frac{2}{3},\frac{2\beta+1}{2\beta+2}\right\}}$ in fisher divergence under the smoothness assumption that $\log p_0\in\mathcal{r}(c^\beta)$ for some $\beta\ge 0$, where $c$ is a certain hilbert-schmidt operator on $h$ and $\mathcal{r}(c^\beta)$ denotes the image of $c^\beta$. we also investigate the misspecified case of $p_0\notin\mathcal{p}$ and show that $j(p_0\vert\hat{p}_n)\rightarrow \inf_{p\in\mathcal{p}}j(p_0\vert p)$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$, and provide a rate for this convergence under a similar smoothness condition as above. through numerical simulations we demonstrate that the proposed estimator outperforms the non-parametric kernel density estimator, and that the advantage with the proposed estimator grows as $d$ increases.

moving beyond the therapeutic relationship: a selective review of intimacy in the sexual health encounter in nursing practice. teaching sex education to school pupils in scotland continues to be a controversial issue. in reality there is lack of leadership, strategy and an uncoordinated approach to delivering this important topic. the school nurse is frequently identified as a suitable professional to lead the way because it is assumed that school nurses are well educated in the field of sexual and reproductive health. nationally, little is known about the educational status of scottish school nurses and there is no research evidence available from which generalisations can be made. this study aims to explore the educational preparation of school nurses that underpins teaching sex education to school pupils in scotland. a cross-sectional descriptive study was completed in september 1998. the results confirmed that school nurses in scotland are predominantly female and 70% of the respondents (n=117) were over the age of 40 years of age. no common basic nursing qualification was identified. the majority of school nurses in scotland perceive sex education to be part of their role and 39% (n=65) testified that specific sexual health training had been undertaken. many lack confidence in this area of practice and are aware of extensive educational needs in relation to teaching sexual health and reproductive health. despite these findings 75% (n=126) were actively involved in teaching sex education to school pupils.
sources of seasonal fractional integration in macroeconomic time series a simple construction that will be referred to as an error-duration model is shown to generate fractional integration and long memory. an error-duration representation also exists for many familiar arma models, making error duration an alternative to autoregression for explaining dynamic persistence in economic variables. the results lead to a straightforward procedure for simulating fractional integration and establish a connection between fractional integration and common notions of structural change. two examples show how the error-duration model could account for fractional integration in aggregate employment and in asset price volatility.
arabidopsis ttg2 regulates try expression through enhancement of activator complex-triggered activation[c][w] trichome patterning in arabidopsis rosette leaves serves as a model system to study how individual cells are determined in a regular spacing pattern from initially equivalent cells. a conserved gene cassette regulates this spacing pattern. bhlh, myb, and wd40 factors are positive regulators of trichome development that are inhibited by r3 single-repeat myb proteins. one positive regulator, the wd40-protein, and the negative regulators are mobile and are transported in opposite directions: the wd40 factor moves to the negative regulators away from trichome initials. this movement behavior and the genetic and molecular interactions between the contributing genes and proteins make it very difficult to derive the mechanistic core behind pattern formation. attempts to develop mathematical models toward this end are critically discussed.
dynamics of outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization during apoptosis protein expression is a stochastic process that leads to phenotypic variation among cells. the cell–cell distribution of protein levels in microorganisms has been well characterized but little is known about such variability in human cells. here, we studied the variability of protein levels in human cells, as well as the temporal dynamics of this variability, and addressed whether cells with higher than average protein levels eventually have lower than average levels, and if so, over what timescale does this mixing occur. we measured fluctuations over time in the levels of 20 endogenous proteins in living human cells, tagged by the gene for yellow fluorescent protein at their chromosomal loci. we found variability with a standard deviation that ranged, for different proteins, from about 15% to 30% of the mean. mixing between high and low levels occurred for all proteins, but the mixing time was longer than two cell generations (more than 40 h) for many proteins. we also tagged pairs of proteins with two colours, and found that the levels of proteins in the same biological pathway were far more correlated than those of proteins in different pathways. the persistent memory for protein levels that we found might underlie individuality in cell behaviour and could set a timescale needed for signals to affect fully every member of a cell population.
optical multilayers as a tool for visualizing special relativity wigner rotations and iwasawa decompositions are manifestations of the internal space-time symmetries of massive and massless particles, respectively. it is shown to be possible to produce combinations of optical filters which exhibit transformations corresponding to wigner rotations and iwasawa decompositions. this is possible because the combined effects of rotation, phase-shift, and attenuation filters lead to transformation matrices of the six-parameter lorentz group applicable to jones vectors and stokes parameters for polarized light waves. the symmetry transformations in special relativity lead to a set of experiments which can be performed in optics laboratories.
phosphoinositide binding by the toll adaptor dmyd88 controls antibacterial responses in drosophila. the toll signaling pathway is required for the innate immune response against fungi and gram-positive bacteria in drosophila. here we show that the endosomal proteins myopic (mop) and hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (hrs) are required for the activation of the toll signaling pathway. this requirement is observed in cultured cells and in flies, and epistasis experiments show that the mop protein functions upstream of the myd88 adaptor and the pelle kinase. mop and hrs, which are critical components of the escrt-0 endocytosis complex, colocalize with the toll receptor in endosomes. we conclude that endocytosis is required for the activation of the toll signaling pathway.
augmentation of tibial plateau fractures with an injectable bone substitute: cerament™. three year follow-up from a prospective study objectives to investigate the capacity of cerament, an injectable bone substitute, to guide bone generation from a cortical surface.   materials and method cerament was applied to the cortical surface of rat tibiae and investigated histologically after 3, 6 and 12 weeks, using a procedure similar to that performed in sham-operated rats.   results in both groups, the thickness of the bone cortex increased significantly from 473 + or - 58 microm (mean + or - sd) at day 0 to 1193 + or - 255 microm (cerament) and 942 + or - 323 microm (sham) after 3 weeks. in the cerament group, the new bone thickness remained constant (1258 + or - 288 microm) until the end of the experiment at 12 weeks, while the sham group demonstrated a return to initial cortical thickness (591 + or - 73 microm) at 12 weeks. the newly formed bone in the cerament group was highly trabecular after 3 weeks but attained a normal trabecular structure of the cortex after 12 weeks.   conclusion cerament may guide bone generation from an intact cortical bone surface. although bone remodeling speed may differ between rats and humans, our study indicates that cerament may become a useful alternative to autologous bone, both to fill defects and to increase bone volume by cortical augmentation.
kicking out the trolls - antecedents of social exclusion intentions in facebook groups we investigated how intentions to hide and unfriend facebook contacts were linked to perceived sender attractiveness and face-threating messages (ftas). intention to hide was higher than intention to unfriend contacts, implying that unfriending is harsher. low social attractiveness predicted hiding and unfriending intentions, but low physical attractiveness was only linked to hiding. disrespectful messages were linked to hiding contacts, while updates that made the receiver look bad were linked to unfriending. ftas also mediated the influence of social and physical attractiveness on hiding and unfriending contacts. overall, managing online relationships relied on independent and interdependent perceptual and behavioral processes.
anatomical features associated with venous congestion in diep flap using ct angiography with three-dimensional reconstruction background: despite improving outcomes, venous problems in the harvest of deep inferior epigastric artery perforator (diep) flaps remain the more common vascular complications. however, it is apparent that the venous anatomy of the anterior abdominal wall has not been described to the same extent as the arterial anatomy. previous anatomical studies have focused on cadaveric anatomy or excisional specimens. the current study uses in vivo computed tomographic angiography to evaluate this anatomy, in combination with a cadaveric radiographic study. methods: both cadaveric and in vivo studies were undertaken using eight whole fresh cadaveric specimens (16 sides) and 100 patients undergoing diep flap breast reconstruction (200 sides). the cadaveric component used direct catheter venography and the in vivo studies were undertaken using preoperative computed tomographic angiography, mapping in vivo venous flow. results: the location, caliber, course, and distribution of the superficial and deep inferior epigastric veins were recorded. the dominance of each system and their direction of drainage were described. mechanisms for poor venous drainage were postulated, including perforator size, midline crossover of the superficial inferior epigastric vein, and the superficial and deep inferior epigastric vein communications. the incidence of each of these anatomical factors was evaluated. conclusion: the cause of venous compromise is multifactorial, with the current study showing that preoperative computed tomographic angiography may predict venous problems during flap harvest, by demonstrating perforator diameter, midline crossover, and deep-superficial venous communications.
embryoid body formation of human amniotic fluid stem cells depends on mtor the target of rapamycin (tor) is a conserved ser/thr kinase that regulates cell growth and metabolism in response to environmental cues. here, highlighting contributions from studies in model organisms, we review mammalian tor complexes and the signaling branches they mediate. tor is part of two distinct multiprotein complexes, tor complex 1 (torc1), which is sensitive to rapamycin, and torc2, which is not. the physiological consequences of mammalian torc1 dysregulation suggest that inhibitors of mammalian tor may be useful in the treatment of cancer, cardiovascular disease, autoimmunity, and metabolic disorders.
neuronal network analysis axons in the cerebral cortex receive synaptic input at the axon initial segment almost exclusively from γ-aminobutyric acid–releasing (gabaergic) axo-axonic cells (aacs). the axon has the lowest threshold for action potential generation in neurons; thus, aacs are considered to be strategically placed inhibitory neurons controlling neuronal output. however, we found that aacs can depolarize pyramidal cells and can initiate stereotyped series of synaptic events in rat and human cortical networks because of a depolarized reversal potential for axonal relative to perisomatic gabaergic inputs. excitation and signal propagation initiated by aacs is supported by the absence of the potassium chloride cotransporter 2 in the axon.
association between variants in the genes for adiponectin and its receptors with insulin resistance syndrome (irs)-related phenotypes in mexican americans the adiponectin receptors, adipor1 and adipor2, are thought to transmit the insulin-sensitizing, anti-inflammatory, and atheroprotective effects of adiponectin. in this study, we examined whether adipor mrna expression in human myotubes correlates with in vivo measures of insulin sensitivity. myotubes from 40 metabolically characterized donors expressed 1.8-fold more adipor1 than adipor2 mrna (588 +/- 35 vs. 321 +/- 39 fg/microg total rna). moreover, the expression levels of both receptors correlated with each other (r = 0.45, p < 0.01). adipor1 mrna expression was positively correlated with in vivo insulin and c-peptide concentrations, first-phase insulin secretion, and plasma triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations before and after adjustment for sex, age, waist-to-hip ratio, and body fat. expression of adipor2 mrna clearly associated only with plasma triglyceride concentrations. in multivariate linear regression models, mrna expression of adipor1, but not adipor2, was a determinant of first-phase insulin secretion independent of insulin sensitivity and body fat. finally, insulin did not directly modify myotube adipor1 mrna expression in vitro. in conclusion, we provide evidence that myotube mrna levels of both receptors are associated with distinct metabolic functions but not with insulin sensitivity. adipor1, but not adipor2, expression correlated with insulin secretion. the molecular nature of this link between muscle and beta-cells needs to be further clarified.
nf-kappab, and not mycn, regulates mhc class i and endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidases in human neuroblastoma cells. the endoplasmic reticulum (er) aminopeptidases erap1 and erap2 contribute to generate hla class i binding peptides. recently, we have shown that the expression of these enzymes is high and coordinated (with each other and with hla class i molecules) in immortalized b cells, but variable and imbalanced in human tumour cell lines of various non‐lymphoid lineages. herein, this issue was investigated in vivo by testing erap1 and erap2 expression in normal non‐lymphoid tissues and their malignant counterparts. erap1 and erap2 were detected exclusively in the epithelial cells of over half of the tested normal tissues. four erap1/erap2 phenotypes (+/+, −/−, +/− and −/+) were detected, and the presence of either or both enzymes was not necessarily associated with hla class i expression. in more than 160 neoplastic lesions, the expression of either or both aminopeptidases was retained, lost (most frequently, particularly erap1) or acquired as compared to the normal counterparts, depending on the tumour histotype. the double‐negative (−/−) phenotype was the most frequent, and significantly (p = 0.013) associated with a lack of detectable hla class i antigens. in selected neoplastic lesions, erap1 and erap2 were also tested for their enzymatic (peptide‐trimming) activities. expression and function were found to correlate, indicating that immunohistochemistry detects active enzymes in vivo. thus, dissociation in the expression of erap1, erap2 and hla class i may already be present in some normal tissues, but malignant transformation causes additional losses, gains and imbalances in specific tumour histotypes, and these alter the peptide‐trimming ability of tumour cells in vivo. j. cell. physiol. 216: 742–749, 2008, © 2008 wiley‐liss, inc.
cell death induced by zinc and cadmium is mediated by clusterin in cultured mouse seminiferous tubules nuclear clusterin (nclu) is an ionizing radiation (ir)-inducible protein that binds ku70, and triggers apoptosis when overexpressed in mcf-7 cells. we demonstrate that endogenous nclu synthesis is a product of alternative splicing. reverse transcriptase-pcr analyses revealed that exon ii, containing the first aug and encoding the endoplasmic reticulum-targeting peptide, was omitted. exons i and iii are spliced together placing a downstream aug in exon iii as the first available translation start site. this shorter mrna produces the 49-kda precursor nclu protein. ku70 binding activity was localized to the c-terminal coiled-coil domain of nclu. leucine residues 357, 358, and 361 of nclu were necessary for ku70-nclu interaction. the n- and c-terminal coiled-coil domains of nclu interacted with each other, suggesting that the protein could dimerize or fold. mutation analyses indicate that the c-terminal nls was functional in nclu with the same contribution from n-terminal nls. the c-terminal coiled-coil domain of nclu was the minimal region required for ku binding and apoptosis. mcf-7 cells show nuclear as well as cytoplasmic expression of gfp-nclu in apoptotic cells. cytosolic aggregation of gfp-nclu was found in viable cells. these results indicate that an inactive precursor of nclu exists in the cytoplasm of non-irradiated mcf-7 cells, translocates into the nucleus following ir, and induces apoptosis.
effect of glucose on xylose utilization in saccharomyces cerevisiae harboring the xylose reductase gene the increased concern for the security of the oil supply and the negative impact of fossil fuels on the environment, particularly greenhouse gas emissions, has put pressure on society to find renewable fuel alternatives. the most common renewable fuel today is ethanol produced from sugar or grain (starch); however, this raw material base will not be sufficient. consequently, future large-scale use of ethanol will most certainly have to be based on production from lignocellulosic materials. this review gives an overview of the new technologies required and the advances achieved in recent years to bring lignocellulosic ethanol towards industrial production. one of the major challenges is to optimize the integration of process engineering, fermentation technology, enzyme engineering and metabolic engineering.
control of kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus reactivation induced by multiple signals abstract human herpesvirus 8 (hhv-8) (also known as kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus) encodes a novel noncoding polyadenylated nuclear (pan) rna (also known as t1.1 or nut-1) during the early phase of lytic replication. pan rna is the most abundant transcript of hhv-8, comprising 80% of total poly(a)-selected transcripts in hhv-8-infected cells during lytic replication. we directly measured the abundance of pan rna by visualizing 1.1- to 1.2- kb pan rna in an ethidium bromide-stained gel from poly(a)-selected rna. we further pursued the mechanisms by which pan rna expression is induced to such high levels.rta, an immediate-early gene of hhv-8, is a transactivator that is sufficient and necessary to activate lytic gene expression in latently infected cells. ectopic expression of rta was previously shown to induce pan rna expression from the endogenous viral genome and activate the pan promoter in a reporter system. here, we have identified the rta-responsive element (rre) in the pan promoter. deletion analysis revealed that the rre is present in a region between nucleotides −69 and −38 of the pan promoter. a promoter construct containing the 69 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site of the pan promoter was activated by rta in the absence or presence of the hhv-8 genome. rta activated the pan promoter up to 7,000-fold in 293t cells and 2,000-fold in b cells. electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that rta formed a highly stable complex with the rre of the pan promoter. our study suggests that rta can induce pan rna expression by direct binding of rta to the rre of the pan promoter. this study has highlighted an important mechanism controlling pan rna expression and also provides a model system for investigating how rta transactivates gene expression during lytic replication.
arbuscular mycorrhiza formation in cordate gametophytes of two ferns, angiopteris lygodiifolia and osmunda japonica many plant species are characterized by a life cycle with a long-lived, subterranean phase that is completely dependent on mycorrhizal fungal symbionts for fixed carbon. this type of life cycle is both phylogenetically and ecologically widespread and is found in diverse vascular plant lineages from the tropics to subalpine meadows. here we report on the molecular identities of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi associated with the autotrophic and underground mycoheterotrophic life cycle phases of the ferns botrychium crenulatum and b. lanceolatum. we show that the glomus taxa found in the mycoheterotrophic life cycle phases of b. crenulatum and b. lanceolatum are also found in conspecific and heterospecific photosynthetic neighboring plants. from our dna sequence data, we infer carbon flow from photosynthetic plants to mycoheterotrophic plants through shared glomalean fungal networks. finally, our phylogenetic analyses identify a major glomus clade that forms associations with mycoheterotrophic life cycle stages of b. crenulatum and b. lanceolatum.
bioremediation strategies for removal of residual atrazine in the boreal groundwater zone the following study evaluated the diversity and biogeography of 83 new atrazine-degrading bacteria and the composition of their atrazine degradation genes. these strains were isolated from 13 agricultural soils and grouped according to rep-pcr genomic fingerprinting into 11 major clusters, which showed biogeographic patterns. three clusters (54 strains) belonged to the genus arthrobacter, seven clusters (28 strains) were similar to the genus nocardioides and only one strain was a gram-negative from the genus ancylobacter. pcr assays for the detection of the genes atza, b, c, d, e, f and trzn conducted with each of the 83 strains revealed that 82 strains (all gram positive) possessed trzn, 74 of them possessed the combination of trzn, atzb and atzc, while only the gram-negative strain had atza. a similar pcr assay for the two analogous genes, atza and trzn, responsible for the first step of atrazine degradation, was performed with dna extracted directly from the enrichment cultures and microcosms spiked with atrazine. in these assays, the gene trzn was detected in each culture, while atza was detected in only six out of 13 soils. these results raise an interesting hypothesis on the evolutionary ecology of the two atrazine chlorohydrolase genes (i.e. atza and trzn) and about the biogeography of atrazine-degrading bacteria.
optimizing individual treatment outcomes in men with lower urinary tract symptoms using storage subscale score/total international prostate symptom score (ipss) as a new ipss ratio. aims:  to investigate the diagnostic value of the international prostate symptom score (ipss) voiding‐to‐storage subscore ratio (ipss‐v/s) in male lower urinary tract symptoms (luts).
multivalent scfv display of phagemid repertoires for the selection of carbohydrate-specific antibodies and its application to the thomsen-friedenreich antigen. conventional antisera used as a positive control in antibody tests during hybridoma screening and processing can be replaced to advantage by supernatants of short term spleen cell cultures. such cultures can easily be initiated from the same spleen cell suspension which is prepared in connection with a fusion experiment. either supernatants of corresponding cultures from nonimmune animals or medium alone can serve as a negative control. in vitro produced polyclonal standards show very low background binding compared to antisera raised in vivo. they are convenient "ready-to-use" reagents with an antibody titer comparable to that expected in hybridoma culture fluids. there is no need for immunization and bleeding of separate animals. in addition, these supernatants provide an internal control of the immunization efficiency.
higher education dominance and siloed knowledge: a systematic review of flipped classroom research recent calls for educational reform highlight ongoing concerns about the ability of current curricula to equip aspiring health care professionals with the skills for success. whereas a wide range of proposed solutions attempt to address apparent deficiencies in current educational models, a growing body of literature consistently points to the need to rethink the traditional in-class, lecture-based course model. one such proposal is the flipped classroom, in which content is offloaded for students to learn on their own, and class time is dedicated to engaging students in student-centered learning activities, like problem-based learning and inquiry-oriented strategies. in 2012, the authors flipped a required first-year pharmaceutics course at the university of north carolina eshelman school of pharmacy. they offloaded all lectures to self-paced online videos and used class time to engage students in active learning exercises. in this article, the authors describe the philosophy and methodology used to redesign the basic pharmaceutics ii course and outline the research they conducted to investigate the resulting outcomes. this article is intended to serve as a guide to instructors and educational programs seeking to develop, implement, and evaluate innovative and practical strategies to transform students’ learning experience. as class attendance, students’ learning, and the perceived value of this model all increased following participation in the flipped classroom, the authors conclude that this approach warrants careful consideration as educators aim to enhance learning, improve outcomes, and fully equip students to address 21st-century health care needs.
hypothesis: emergence of translation as a result of rna helicase evolution during transcription, rna polymerase (rnap) moves processively along a dna template, creating a complementary rna. here we present the development of an ultra-stable optical trapping system with ångström-level resolution, which we used to monitor transcriptional elongation by single molecules of escherichia coli rnap. records showed discrete steps averaging 3.7 ± 0.6 å, a distance equivalent to the mean rise per base found in b-dna. by combining our results with quantitative gel analysis, we conclude that rnap advances along dna by a single base pair per nucleotide addition to the nascent rna. we also determined the force–velocity relationship for transcription at both saturating and sub-saturating nucleotide concentrations; fits to these data returned a characteristic distance parameter equivalent to one base pair. global fits were inconsistent with a model for movement incorporating a power stroke tightly coupled to pyrophosphate release, but consistent with a brownian ratchet model incorporating a secondary ntp binding site.
a general method to solve complex problems by combining multiple answer set programs we first introduce abstract dpll, a rule-based formulation of the davis--putnam--logemann--loveland (dpll) procedure for propositional satisfiability. this abstract framework allows one to cleanly express practical dpll algorithms and to formally reason about them in a simple way. its properties, such as soundness, completeness or termination, immediately carry over to the modern dpll implementations with features such as backjumping or clause learning.we then extend the framework to satisfiability modulo background theories (smt) and use it to model several variants of the so-called lazy approach for smt. in particular, we use it to introduce a few variants of a new, efficient and modular approach for smt based on a general dpll(x) engine, whose parameter x can be instantiated with a specialized solver solvert for a given theory t, thus producing a dpll(t) system. we describe the high-level design of dpll(x) and its cooperation with solvert, discuss the role of theory propagation, and describe different dpll(t) strategies for some theories arising in industrial applications.our extensive experimental evidence, summarized in this article, shows that dpll(t) systems can significantly outperform the other state-of-the-art tools, frequently even in orders of magnitude, and have better scaling properties.
noradrenergic content and turnover rate in kidney and heart shows gender and strain differences. a method of measuring the rate of synthesis of catecholamines in various tissues takes advantage of the steady state relationship in which the rate of catecholamine formation is equal to the rate of efflux. after tyrosine hydroxylase is blocked with α-methyltyrosine, the brain levels of norepinephrine (ne) and dopamine and the ne levels in various peripheral tissues of rats and rabbits decline exponentially. the rate of synthesis of the catecholamines is calculated from the product of the rate constant of amine decline and the normal catecholamine level. the value for heart ne yielded by this method is almost identical with that obtained from the decline in radioactivity after labeling with dl -h3-ne. the application of this method to studies in the rat shows that the turnover time for ne in heart, salivary gland and iris is about 12 hr, compared to 6 hr for brain ne, 3 hr for brain dopamine and 2 hr for ne in the cervical sympathetic ganglia. in the rabbit hypothalamus, ne is formed five times more rapidly than in the midbrain, though the turnover times are almost identical. this suggests that the rate of synthesis might be similar in each adrenergic unit and that variations in rates of synthesis in different brain areas are a function of the number of neurons per gram of tissue.
shiga toxin and beta-lactamases genes in escherichia coli phylotypes isolated from carcasses of broiler chickens slaughtered in iran. the relationship between human diseases caused by infection with shiga toxin (stx)-producing escherichia coli (stec) o157 strains and o157 strains isolated from cattle was investigated in an area where stockbreeding is prolific. for this purpose, the stx genotypes, the molecular epidemiological characteristics of 268 stec o157 strains including 211 human-origin strains and 57 cattle-origin strains, and clinical manifestations of 210 stec-infected people were analyzed. of 211 human-origin strains, 92 strains (44%) were of the stx1/stx2 genotype, and 74 strains (35%) were of the stx2c genotype. most of the people infected with stx2c genotype strains presented no symptoms or mild symptoms such as slight diarrhea, except for 3 patients with bloody diarrhea. of the 57 cattle-origin strains, 27 strains (47%) were of the stx2c genotype and 17 strains (30%) were of the stx1/stx2 genotype. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and insertion sequence (is) analysis demonstrated that 11 isolates (41%) of the 27 cattle isolates of the stx2c genotype had high homology (>95% identity) with human isolates. these results suggest that some genetic patterns of the stx2c genotype strains might be preserved in cattle or their surrounding environment for several years, and during these periods, they might have opportunities to infect people through various routes. because of the mild virulence of the stx2c genotype strains, they seemed to be transmitted asymptomatically from cattle to humans and then spread from person to person. it may be a public health concern. further, they occasionally cause severe symptoms in humans; therefore, caution is warranted for infections by stx2c genotype o157 strains, in addition to stx2-possessing genotype o157 strains.
ceramide synthase schlank is a transcriptional regulator adapting gene expression to energy requirements. we have isolated and functionally characterized a multicomponent oct-1 coactivator, oca-s which is essential for s phase-dependent histone h2b transcription. the p38 component of oca-s binds directly to oct-1, exhibits potent transactivation potential, is selectively recruited to the h2b promoter in s phase, and is essential for s phase-specific h2b transcription in vivo and in vitro. surprisingly, p38 represents a nuclear form of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and binding to oct-1, as well as oca-s function, is stimulated by nad(+) but inhibited by nadh. oca-s also interacts with npat, a cyclin e/cdk2 substrate that is broadly involved in histone gene transcription. these studies thus link the h2b transcriptional machinery to cell cycle regulators, and possibly to cellular metabolic state (redox status), and set the stage for studies of the underlying mechanisms and the basis for coordinated histone gene expression and coupling to dna replication.
shifting soil resource limitations and ecosystem retrogression across a three million year semi-arid substrate age gradient wardle et al . ([ 1 ][1]) studied six long-term chronosequences in australia, sweden, alaska, hawaii, and new zealand and found that in the absence of major ecosystem disturbance, a transient peak in forest biomass is commonly followed by a forest decline phase. they ascribed the decline of forest
a mitochondria-anchored isoform of the actin-nucleating spire protein regulates mitochondrial division masterminding mitochondrial fission mitochondria are highly dynamic and undergo fusion and fission and they move in cells. defects in mitochondrial dynamics are implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases. recent findings have suggested that mitochondrial fission occurs preferentially at endoplasmic reticulum (er) contact sites, with er circumscribing mitochondria and possibly promoting the constriction of mitochondria during fission. korobova et al. (p. 464) now suggest that an er-localized formin, inf2, is required for mitochondrial fission and that inf2-mediated actin polymerization facilitates mitochondrial constriction. actin filaments between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria promote mitochondrial fission. mitochondrial fission is fundamentally important to cellular physiology. the dynamin-related protein drp1 mediates fission, and interaction between mitochondrion and endoplasmic reticulum (er) enhances fission. however, the mechanism for drp1 recruitment to mitochondria is unclear, although previous results implicate actin involvement. here, we found that actin polymerization through er-localized inverted formin 2 (inf2) was required for efficient mitochondrial fission in mammalian cells. inf2 functioned upstream of drp1. actin filaments appeared to accumulate between mitochondria and inf2-enriched er membranes at constriction sites. thus, inf2-induced actin filaments may drive initial mitochondrial constriction, which allows drp1-driven secondary constriction. because inf2 mutations can lead to charcot-marie-tooth disease, our results provide a potential cellular mechanism for this disease state.
ion channel clustering enhances weak electric field detection by neutrophils: apparent roles of skf96365-sensitive cation channels and myeloperoxidase trafficking in cellular responses application of extremely low frequency pulsed dc electric fields that are frequency- and phase-matched with endogenous metabolic oscillations leads to greatly exaggerated neutrophil extension and metabolic resonance wherein oscillatory nad(p)h amplitudes are increased. in the presence of a resonant field, migrating cell length grows from 10 to approximately 40 microm, as does the overall length of microfilament assemblies. in contrast, cells stop locomotion and become spherical when exposed to phase-mismatched fields. although cellular effects were not found to be dependent on electrode type and buffer, they were sensitive to temporal constraints (phase and pulse length) and cell surface charge. we suggest an electromechanical coupling hypothesis wherein applied electric fields and cytoskeletal polymerization forces act together to overcome the surface/cortical tension of neutrophils, thus promoting net cytoskeletal assembly and heightened metabolic amplitudes. metabolic resonance enhances reactive oxygen metabolic production by neutrophils. furthermore, cellular dna damage was observed after prolonged metabolic resonance using both single cell gel electrophoresis ('comet' assay) and 3'-oh dna labeling using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. these results provide insights into transmembrane signal processing and cell interactions with weak electric fields.
notoginsenoside r1 increases neuronal excitability and ameliorates synaptic and memory dysfunction following amyloid elevation abeta1-42 is a self-associating peptide whose neurotoxic derivatives are thought to play a role in alzheimer's pathogenesis. neurotoxicity of amyloid beta protein (abeta) has been attributed to its fibrillar forms, but experiments presented here characterize neurotoxins that assemble when fibril formation is inhibited. these neurotoxins comprise small diffusible abeta oligomers (referred to as addls, for abeta-derived diffusible ligands), which were found to kill mature neurons in organotypic central nervous system cultures at nanomolar concentrations. at cell surfaces, addls bound to trypsin-sensitive sites and surface-derived tryptic peptides blocked binding and afforded neuroprotection. germ-line knockout of fyn, a protein tyrosine kinase linked to apoptosis and elevated in alzheimer's disease, also was neuroprotective. remarkably, neurological dysfunction evoked by addls occurred well in advance of cellular degeneration. without lag, and despite retention of evoked action potentials, addls inhibited hippocampal long-term potentiation, indicating an immediate impact on signal transduction. we hypothesize that impaired synaptic plasticity and associated memory dysfunction during early stage alzheimer's disease and severe cellular degeneration and dementia during end stage could be caused by the biphasic impact of abeta-derived diffusible ligands acting upon particular neural signal transduction pathways.
differences in helicobacter pylori caga tyrosine phosphorylation motif patterns between western and east asian strains, and influences on interleukin-8 secretion. helicobacter pylori is a causative agent of gastritis and peptic ulcer. caga+h. pylori strains are more virulent than caga− strains and are associated with gastric carcinoma. the caga gene product, caga, is injected by the bacterium into gastric epithelial cells and subsequently undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation. the phosphorylated caga specifically binds shp-2 phosphatase, activates the phosphatase activity, and thereby induces morphological transformation of cells. caga proteins of most western h. pylori isolates have a 34-amino acid sequence that variably repeats among different strains. here, we show that the repeat sequence contains a tyrosine phosphorylation site. caga proteins having more repeats were found to undergo greater tyrosine phosphorylation, to exhibit increased shp-2 binding, and to induce greater morphological changes. in contrast, predominant caga proteins specified by h. pylori strains isolated in east asia, where gastric carcinoma is prevalent, had a distinct tyrosine phosphorylation sequence at the region corresponding to the repeat sequence of western caga. this east asian-specific sequence conferred stronger shp-2 binding and morphologically transforming activities to western caga. finally, a critical amino acid residue that determines shp-2 binding activity among different caga proteins was identified. our results indicate that the potential of individual caga to perturb host-cell functions is determined by the degree of shp-2 binding activity, which depends in turn on the number and sequences of tyrosine phosphorylation sites. the presence of distinctly structured caga proteins in western and east asian h. pylori isolates may underlie the strikingly different incidences of gastric carcinoma in these two geographic areas.
application of constructed wetlands for treating agricultural runoff and agro-industrial wastewater: a review subsurface horizontal flow reed beds are being evaluated for nitrogen (n) and phosphorus (p) removal from plant nursery runoff water in new south wales australia. the need to include plants (phragmites australis), the effect of reaction time (3.5 v 7.0 d) and dissolved organic carbon (doc) on n and p removal in batch fed gravel wetland tubs (55 l) was studied over 19 months. simulated nursery runoff water containing n (10.1 mg l(-1), 74% as no3) and p (0.58 mg l(-1), 88% as po4) and doc (2-5 mg l(-1)) was used. the planted wetland tubs removed >96% tn and tp over most of the 19-month study period while unplanted tubs were inefficient (<16% n and <45% p removal) and occasionally discharged nutrients. doubling the reaction time to 7.0 days had no effect on nutrient removal. plant nutrient uptake accounted for most of the n (76%) and p (86%) removed while roots and rhizomes were the dominant sink (n 58%, p 67%). the addition of methanol (c:n-3:1) to unplanted tubs achieved 81-98% n removal. in carbon limited low nutrient nursery runoff, plants were essential to a gravel-based wetland to achieve efficient nutrient removal with effluent tn and tp concentrations of <1 mg l(-1) and 0.05 mg l(-1), respectively with a 3.5 day reaction time.
towards a framework of digital platform competition: a comparative study of monopolistic & federated mobile payment platforms i this essay, we argue that pervasive digitization gives birth to a new type of product architecture: the layered modular architecture. the layered modular architecture extends the modular architecture of physical products by incorporating four loosely coupled layers of devices, networks, services, and contents created by digital technology. we posit that this new architecture instigates profound changes in the ways that firms organize for innovation in the future. we develop (1) a conceptual framework to describe the emerging organizing logic of digital innovation and (2) an information systems research agenda for digital strategy and the creation and management of corporate information technology infrastructures.
a genome-wide survey of hd-zip genes in rice and analysis of drought-responsive family members hahb-4 is a member of the helianthusannuus (sunflower) subfamily i of hd-zip proteins that is transcriptionally regulated by water availability and abscisic acid. transgenic arabidopsis thaliana plants overexpressing this transcription factor (tf) exhibit a characteristic phenotype that includes a strong tolerance to water stress. here we show that this tf is a new component of ethylene signalling pathways, and that it induces a marked delay in senescence. plants overexpressing hahb-4 are less sensitive to external ethylene, enter the senescence pathway later and do not show the typical triple response. furthermore, transgenic plants expressing this gene under the control of its own inducible promoter showed an inverse correlation between ethylene sensitivity and hahb-4 levels. potential targets of hahb-4 were identified by comparing the transcriptome of hahb-4-transformed and wild-type plants using microarrays and quantitative rt-pcr. expression of this tf has a major repressive effect on genes related to ethylene synthesis, such as aco and sam, and on genes related to ethylene signalling, such as erf2 and erf5. expression studies in sunflower indicate that hahb-4 transcript levels are elevated in mature/senescent leaves. expression of hahb-4 is induced by ethylene, concomitantly with several genes homologous to the targets identified in the transcriptome analysis (ha-acoa and ha-acob). transient transformation of sunflower leaves demonstrated the action of hahb-4 in the regulation of ethylene-related genes. we propose that hahb-4 is involved in a novel conserved mechanism related to ethylene-mediated senescence that functions to improve desiccation tolerance.
mcl-1 regulates effector and memory cd8 t-cell differentiation during acute viral infection. regulated apoptosis is essential for both the development and the subsequent maintenance of the immune system. interleukins, including il-2, il-4, il-7 and il-15, heavily influence lymphocyte survival during the vulnerable stages of vdj rearrangement and later in ensuring cellular homeostasis, but the genes specifically responsible for the development and maintenance of lymphocytes have not been identified. the antiapoptotic protein mcl-1 is an attractive candidate, as it is highly regulated, appears to enhance short-term survival and functions at an apical step in genotoxic deaths. however, mcl-1 deficiency results in peri-implantation lethality. here we show that mice conditional for mcl-1 display a profound reduction in b and t lymphocytes when mcl-1 is removed. deletion of mcl-1 during early lymphocyte differentiation increased apoptosis and arrested the development at pro-b-cell and double-negative t-cell stages. induced deletion of mcl-1 in peripheral b- and t-cell populations resulted in their rapid loss. moreover, il-7 both induced and required mcl-1 to mediate lymphocyte survival. thus, mcl-1, which selectively inhibits the proapoptotic protein bim, is essential both early in lymphoid development and later on in the maintenance of mature lymphocytes.
nonsymbolic text representation we describe an lstm-based model which we call byte-to-span (bts) that reads text as bytes and outputs span annotations of the form [start, length, label] where start positions, lengths, and labels are separate entries in our vocabulary. because we operate directly on unicode bytes rather than language-specific words or characters, we can analyze text in many languages with a single model. due to the small vocabulary size, these multilingual models are very compact, but produce results similar to or better than the state-of- the-art in part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition that use only the provided training datasets (no external data sources). our models are learning "from scratch" in that they do not rely on any elements of the standard pipeline in natural language processing (including tokenization), and thus can run in standalone fashion on raw text.
moderate intensity exercise training reverses functional aerobic impairment in hiv-infected individuals we attempted to measure cardiopulmonary effects, cd4 counts, and perceived sense of well-being in 25 individuals moderately to severely immunocompromised from hiv infection (mean entry cd4 count = 144.microliters-1) before and after a 24-wk program of exercise training. only six subjects completed the 24-wk program. all six showed evidence of a training effect. statistically significant improvements were seen in maximal oxygen consumption (vo2max), oxygen pulse, and minute ventilation. submaximal exercise performance improved significantly by 12 wk in the 10 individuals available for testing: decreases were seen in heart rate, rate pressure product, and rate of perceived exertion. white blood cell counts and t-lymphocyte subsets were stable at 12 and 24 wk in the subjects available for testing. high depression/anxiety scores on a mental health inventory (general health questionnaire) correlated with low cd4 counts. scores did not correlate with compliance with the exercise program. there was a trend (p < 0.10) for scores to improve over time among those individuals who attended > or = 80% of scheduled exercise sessions. we conclude that exercise training is feasible and beneficial for some hiv-infected individuals.
public health challenges of electronic cigarettes in south korea objectives we evaluated the effect of strict tobacco control policies, implemented beginning in 1995 in the republic of korea, on smoking prevalence and deaths.   methods simsmoke is a simulation model of the effect of tobacco control policies over time on smoking initiation and cessation. it uses standard attribution methods to estimate lives saved as a result of new policies. after validating the model against smoking prevalence, we used it to determine the korean policies' effect on smoking prevalence.   results the model predicted smoking prevalence accurately between 1995 and 2006. we estimated that 70% of the 24% relative reduction in smoking rates over that period was attributable to tobacco control policies, mainly tax increases and a strong media campaign, and that the policies will prolong 104 812 male lives by the year 2027.   conclusions our results document korea's success in reducing smoking prevalence and prolonging lives, which may serve as an example for other asian nations. further improvements may be possible with higher taxes and more comprehensive smoke-free laws, cessation policies, advertising restrictions, and health warnings.
cognitive correlates of “neglect-like syndrome” in patients with complex regional pain syndrome the body schema is based on an intact cortical body representation. its disruption is indicated by delayed reaction times (rt) and high error rates when deciding on the laterality of a pictured hand in a limb laterality recognition task. similarities in both cortical reorganisation and disrupted body schema have been found in two different unilateral pain syndromes, one with deafferentation (phantom limb pain, plp) and one with pain-induced dysfunction (complex regional pain syndrome, crps). this study aims to compare the extent of impaired laterality recognition in these two groups. performance on a test battery for attentional performance (tap 2.0) and on a limb laterality recognition task was evaluated in crps (n=12), plp (n=12) and healthy subjects (n=38). differences between recognising affected and unaffected hands were analysed. crps patients and healthy subjects additionally completed a four-day training of limb laterality recognition. reaction time was significantly delayed in both crps (2278±735.7ms) and plp (2301.3±809.3ms) compared to healthy subjects (1826.5±517.0ms), despite normal tap values in all groups. there were no differences between recognition of affected and unaffected hands in both patient groups. both healthy subjects and crps patients improved during training, but rts of crps patients (1874.5±613.3ms) remain slower (p<0.01) than those of healthy subjects (1280.6±343.2ms) after four-day training. despite different pathomechanisms, the body schema is equally disrupted in plp and crps patients, uninfluenced by attention and pain and cannot be fully reversed by training alone. this suggests the involvement of complex central nervous system mechanisms in the disruption of the body schema.

ftir spectroscopic study of molecular organization of the antibiotic amphotericin b in aqueous solution and in dppc lipid monolayers containing the sterols cholesterol and ergosterol monolayers of amphotericin b (amb) and monolayers composed of amb and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (dppc) were formed at the argon–water interface and deposited on a solid support by means of the langmuir–blodgett technique. the hypsochromic shift observed in the absorption spectra of monolayers is indicative of aggregated structures of amb. the exciton splitting theory allowed us to calculate the distance between neighboring molecules in the aggregates as 7.8 å. scanning force microscopy of the amb monolayers revealed the formation of a homogeneous monolayer composed of molecules separated by a distance of 6–8 å. microscopy also reveals the formation of cylindrical structures of amb with a diameter close to 17 å (internal diameter close to 6 å) in the monolayers containing additionally 10 mol% dppc.
ifn-α confers resistance of systemic lupus erythematosus nephritis to therapy in nzb/w f1 mice costimulatory blockade with ctla4ig and anti-cd40l along with a single dose of cyclophosphamide induces remission of systemic lupus erythematosus nephritis in nzb/w f1 mice. to understand the mechanisms for remission and for impending relapse, we examined the expression profiles of 61 inflammatory molecules in the perfused kidneys of treated mice and untreated mice at different stages of disease. further studies using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry allowed us to determine the cellular origins of several key markers. we show that only a limited set of inflammatory mediators is expressed in the kidney following glomerular immune complex deposition but before the onset of proteinuria. formation of a lymphoid aggregate in the renal pelvis precedes the invasion of the kidney by inflammatory cells. regulatory molecules are expressed early in the disease process and during remission but do not prevent the inevitable progression of active inflammation. onset of proliferative glomerulonephritis and proteinuria is associated with activation of the renal endothelium, expression of chemokines that mediate glomerular cell infiltration, and infiltration by activated dendritic cells and macrophages that migrate to different topographical areas of the kidney but express a similar profile of inflammatory cytokines. increasing interstitial infiltration by macrophages and progressive tubular damage, manifested by production of lipocalin-2, occur later in the disease process. studies of treated mice identify a type ii (m2b)-activated macrophage as a marker of remission induction and impending relapse and suggest that therapy for systemic lupus erythematosus nephritis should include strategies that prevent both activation of monocytes and their migration to the kidney.
basolateral amygdala response to food cues in the absence of hunger is associated with weight gain susceptibility experimental animals that are trained to associate a cue with food consumption when hunger prevails will subsequently consume a greater amount of food when that cue is presented under conditions of satiety. previously, we showed that this phenomenon of conditioned potentiation of feeding is abolished by a neurotoxic lesion that encompasses the basolateral (bl), basomedial (bm), and lateral (la) nuclei of the amygdala (amy) and by disconnection of this region and lateral hypothalamus (lha). here, we combined immediate-early gene (ieg) and tract-tracing methods to map functional amy–lha circuitry that is engaged when potentiated feeding is produced by pavlovian conditioning. sated rats were assessed for food consumption in the presence of a cue that was paired previously with food (cs+), or in the presence of another cue that was never paired with food (cs–), in two consecutive tests temporally arranged for activation of the effector iegs arc (activity-regulated cytoskeletal protein) and homer 1a. we examined the selective induction of the iegs by tests with cs+ or cs– presentations in amy neurons that project to lha, as identified with the retrograde tracer fluorogold. using the same labeling methods, we also examined neurons in several other forebrain regions, including the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, that receive strong inputs from bl/bm/la nuclei and, in turn, innervate the lha. our results indicate that a cue that has acquired the ability to promote eating in sated rats (cs+) strongly activates a functional network formed by direct pathways from the bl/bm and orbitomedial prefrontal cortex to the lha.
delivery of nkg2d ligand using an anti-her2 antibody-nkg2d ligand fusion protein results in an enhanced innate and adaptive antitumor response. dab(389)il-2 (denileukin diftitox, ontak) is a cytokine-targeted fusion protein that delivers the catalytic domain of diphtheria toxin to lymphoma cells expressing the interleukin-2 receptor (il-2r). in phase i and phase iii studies of dab(389)il-2 in patients with cutaneous t-cell lymphoma (ctcl), non-hodgkin's lymphoma, and hodgkin's disease in which premedications were limited to diphenhydramine and acetaminophen, acute infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 70% of patients and vascular leak syndrome (vls) in 27%, resulting in discontinuation of therapy in 29% of patients. there was no correlation between the dose or half-life of dab(389)il-2 and the occurrence of hypersensitivity events or vls. to explore whether steroid premedication would improve the tolerability of dab(389)il-2, we treated 15 patients with ctcl with either dexamethasone or prednisone prior to each dose of dab(389)il-2. the incidence of acute infusion events was significantly decreased, with only three patients experiencing acute infusion events (one grade 4) and only two patients developing clinically apparent vls. grade 3 skin rash occurred in two patients and moderately severe asthenia in nine patients. a significantly improved response rate of 60% was noted with the use of steroid premedication compared to prior studies in which steroids were prohibited. we conclude that steroid premedication significantly improves the tolerability of dab(389)il-2 without compromising the clinical response.
n-meander scanning trace a method for the on-chip bandwidth reduction this work presents a domain-specific memory subsystem based on a two-level memory hierarchy. it targets the application domain of video post-processing applications including video enhancement and format conversion. these applications are based on motion compensation and/or broad class of content adaptive filtering to provide the highest quality of pictures. our approach meets the required performance and has sufficient flexibility for the application domain. it especially aims at the implementation-wise most challenging applications: compute-intensive and bandwidth-demanding applications that provide the highest quality at high picture resolutions. the lowest level of the memory hierarchy, closest to the processing element, the l0 scratchpad, is organized specifically to enable fast retrieval of an arbitrarily positioned 2-d block of pixels to the processing element. to guarantee the performance, most of its addressing logic is hardwired, leaving a user a set of api for initialization and storing/loading the data to/from the l0 scratchpad. the next level of the memory hierarchy, the l1 scratchpad, minimizes the off-chip memory bandwidth requirements. the l1 scratchpad is organized specifically to enable efficient aligned block-based accesses. with lower data rates compared to the l0 scratchpad and aligned block access, software-based addressing is used to enable full flexibility. the two-level memory hierarchy exploits prefetching to further improve the performance.
design, data, and theory regarding a digital hand inclinometer: a portable device for studying slant perception a dramatic failure of orientation constancy is documented in the perception of downhill slopes. contrary to naïve expectation, steep downhill slopes look shallower from the edge than they do from back from the edge. three experiments document and quantify this failure of constancy for real and virtual surfaces using a variety of dependent measures. two additional studies document overestimation of both non-visually perceived head pitch and perceived gaze declination. a model of orientation constancy failure is fit to the data that combine exaggerations in perceived gaze declination with exaggerated scaling of perceived optical slant. these findings support a functional scale-expansion model of error in slope perception.
mesoscopic effects in an agent-based bargaining model in regular lattices we study evolutionary games in real social networks, with a focus on coordination games. we find that populations fail to coordinate in the same behavior for a wide range of parameters, a novel phenomenon not observed in most artificial model networks. we show that this result arises from the relevance of correlations beyond the first neighborhood, in particular from topological traps formed by links between nodes of different degrees in regions with few or no redundant paths. this specificity of real networks has not been modeled so far with synthetic networks. we thus conclude that model networks must be improved to include these mesoscopic structures, in order to successfully address issues such as the emergence of cooperation in real societies. we finally show that topological traps are a very generic phenomenon that may arise in very many different networks and fields, such as opinion models, spread of diseases or ecological networks.
chemobrain experienced by breast cancer survivors: a meta-ethnography study investigating research and care implications aims and objectives to investigate women's awareness of chemotherapy-induced cognitive changes, their perception of cognitive limitations in carrying out daily tasks and subsequent return to work decisions and perceptions of work ability.   background evidence suggests that women diagnosed with breast cancer experience cognitive changes as a consequence of chemotherapy treatment. although these changes tend to be subtle deficits in memory, concentration and the ability to organise information, there has been no published research identifying how they can impact patient's ability to work and subsequent employment decisions.   design this was a qualitative study.   method data were collected from breast cancer survivors using semi-structured interviews with two focus groups (n = 6, n = 7). interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using template analysis.   results data were categorised into four main themes: (1) awareness of cognitive changes during and following chemotherapy, (2) cognitive ability and confidence in return to work, (3) impact of cognitive changes on work ability and (4) information on the cognitive side effects of chemotherapy.   conclusions the views and experiences of breast cancer survivors towards returning to work and subsequent work ability were affected by chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment. more specifically the appraisal of returning to work and ability to manage work were influenced by three interrelated factors: (1) actual cognitive ability following chemotherapy, (2) awareness of cognitive failures by the women and their families and (3) the subsequent impact on their confidence in carrying out daily tasks including work tasks.   relevance to clinical practice more information and support is needed to help patients with cancer to manage chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairments in home and workplace. nurses are increasingly asked about the impact of cancer and its treatment on work and are therefore well positioned to offer this advice. subsequently, nurses require additional knowledge and guidance to provide this information and support.
death following traumatic brain injury in drosophila is associated with intestinal barrier dysfunction in mammals, the pgc-1 transcriptional coactivators are key regulators of energy metabolism, including mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration, which have been implicated in numerous pathogenic conditions, including neurodegeneration and cardiomyopathy. here, we show that overexpression of the drosophila pgc-1 homolog (dpgc-1/spargel) is sufficient to increase mitochondrial activity. moreover, tissue-specific overexpression of dpgc-1 in stem and progenitor cells within the digestive tract extends life span. long-lived flies overexpressing dpgc-1 display a delay in the onset of aging-related changes in the intestine, leading to improved tissue homeostasis in old flies. together, these results demonstrate that dpgc-1 can slow aging both at the level of cellular changes in an individual tissue and also at the organismal level by extending life span. our findings point to the possibility that alterations in pgc-1 activity in high-turnover tissues, such as the intestine, may be an important determinant of longevity in mammals.
contribution of prior semantic knowledge to new episodic learning in amnesia the present study examined how younger and older adults remember price information. participants studied grocery items that were priced at market value or were well above or below market value. although younger adults displayed better recall performance for unrealistic prices than older adults, there was no age difference for realistic prices, and both groups were equally accurate at remembering the general price range of the items. the results suggest that when older adults can rely on prior knowledge and schematic support, and tasks involve naturalistic materials, memory for associative information can be as good as that of younger adults.
ku protein levels, localization and association to replication origins in different stages of breast tumor progression dna-dependent protein kinase (dna-pk) has been implicated in several nuclear processes including transcription1–3, dna replication4,5, double-stranded dna break repair, and v(d) j recombination6–10. linkage of kinase and substrate on dna in cis is required for efficient phosphorylation11. recruitment of dna-pk to dna is by ku autoantigen, a dna-end-binding protein required for dna-pk catalytic activity11. although ku is known to translocate along naked dna12, how dna-end binding by ku might lead to dna-pk-mediated phosphorylation of sequence-specific dna-binding proteins in vivo has not been obvious. here we report the identification of ku as a transcription factor that recruits dna-pk directly to specific dna sequences. nre1 (negative regulatory element 1) is a dna sequence element (−394/ − 381) in the long terminal repeat of mouse mammary tumour virus (mmtv) that is important for repressing inappropriate viral expression13–16. we show that direct binding of ku/dna-pk to nre1 represses glucocorticoid-induced mmtv transcription.
phylogeographical patterns shed light on evolutionary process in south america the making of amazonian diversity the biodiversity of the amazon basin is legendary, but the processes by which it has been generated have been debated. in the late 20th century the prevalent view was that the engine of diversity was repeated contraction and expansion of forest refugia during the past 3 million years or so. hoorn et al. (p. 927) analyze findings from a diverse range of disciplines, including molecular phylogeny, ecology, sedimentology, structural geology, and palaeontology, to offer an overview of the entire history of this region during the cenozoic era (66 million years ago). the uplift of the andes was a pivotal event in the evolution of amazonian landscapes because it continually altered river drainage patterns, which in turn put a variety of pressures on organisms to adapt to changing conditions in a multiplicity of ways. hence, the diversity of the modern biota of the amazon has more ancient origins than previously thought. the amazonian rainforest is arguably the most species-rich terrestrial ecosystem in the world, yet the timing of the origin and evolutionary causes of this diversity are a matter of debate. we review the geologic and phylogenetic evidence from amazonia and compare it with uplift records from the andes. this uplift and its effect on regional climate fundamentally changed the amazonian landscape by reconfiguring drainage patterns and creating a vast influx of sediments into the basin. on this “andean” substrate, a region-wide edaphic mosaic developed that became extremely rich in species, particularly in western amazonia. we show that andean uplift was crucial for the evolution of amazonian landscapes and ecosystems, and that current biodiversity patterns are rooted deep in the pre-quaternary.
four second-sphere residues of thermus thermophilus sg0.5jp17-16 laccase tune the catalysis by hydrogen-bonding networks distal pocket water molecules have been widely implicated in the delivery of protons required in o-o bond heterolysis in the p450 reaction cycle. targeted dehydration of the cytochrome p450cam (cyp101) distal pocket through mutagenesis of a distal pocket glycine to either valine or threonine results in the alteration of spin state equilibria, and has dramatic consequences on the catalytic rate, coupling efficiency, and kinetic solvent isotope effect parameters, highlighting an important role of the active-site hydration level on p450 catalysis. cryoradiolysis of the mutant cyp101 oxyferrous complexes further indicates a specific perturbation of proton-transfer events required for the transformation of ferric-peroxo to ferric-hydroperoxo states. finally, crystallography of the 248val and 248thr mutants in both the ferric camphor bound resting state and ferric-cyano adducts shows both the alteration of hydrogen-bonding networks and the alteration of heme geometry parameters. taken together, these results indicate that the distal pocket microenvironment governs the transformation of reactive heme-oxygen intermediates in p450 cytochromes.
mechanisms of hemispheric lateralization: a replication study functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) is one of the most important methods for in vivo investigation of cognitive processes in the human brain. within the last two decades, an explosion of research has emerged using fmri, revealing the underpinnings of everything from motor and sensory processes to the foundations of social cognition. while these results have revealed the potential of neuroimaging, important questions regarding the reliability of these results remain unanswered. in this paper, we take a close look at what is currently known about the reliability of fmri findings. first, we examine the many factors that influence the quality of acquired fmri data. we also conduct a review of the existing literature to determine if some measure of agreement has emerged regarding the reliability of fmri. finally, we provide commentary on ways to improve fmri reliability and what questions remain unanswered. reliability is the foundation on which scientific investigation is based. how reliable are the results from fmri?
mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from reed canary grass in paludiculture: effect of groundwater level northern peatland methane (ch4) budgets are important for global ch4 emissions. this study aims to determine the ecosystem ch4 budget and specifically to quantify the importance of phalaris arundinacea by using different chamber techniques in a temperate wetland. annually, roughly 70 ± 35% of ecosystem ch4 emissions were plant-mediated, but data show no evidence of significant diurnal variations related to convective gas flow regardless of season or plant growth stages. therefore, despite a high percentage of arenchyma, p. arundinacea-mediated ch4 transport is interpreted to be predominantly passive. thus, diurnal variations are less important in contrast to wetland vascular plants facilitating convective gas flow. despite of plant-dominant ch4 transport, net ch4 fluxes were low (– 0.005–0.016 μmol m−2 s−1) and annually less than 1% of the annual c-co2 assimilation. this is considered a result of an effective root zone oxygenation resulting in increased ch4 oxidation in the rhizosphere at high water levels. this study shows that although ch4, having a global warming potential 25 times greater than co2, is emitted from this p. arundinacea wetland, less than 9% of the c sequestered counterbalances the ch4 emissions to the atmosphere. it is concluded that p. arundinacea-dominant wetlands are an attractive c-sequestration ecosystem.
the phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor roflumilast decreases ethanol consumption in c57bl/6j mice phosphodiesterase (pde) is a critical regulator of camp/protein kinase a (pka) signaling in cells. multiple pdes with different substrate specificities and subcellular localization are expressed in neurons. dopamine plays a central role in the regulation of motor and cognitive functions. the effect of dopamine is largely mediated through the camp/pka signaling cascade, and therefore controlled by pde activity. we used in vitro and in vivo biochemical techniques to dissect the roles of pde4 and pde10a in dopaminergic neurotransmission in mouse striatum by monitoring the ability of selective pde inhibitors to regulate phosphorylation of presynaptic [e.g., tyrosine hydroxylase (th)] and postsynaptic [e.g., dopamine- and camp-regulated phosphoprotein of m r 32 kda (darpp-32)] pka substrates. the pde4 inhibitor, rolipram, induced a large increase in th ser40 phosphorylation at dopaminergic terminals that was associated with a commensurate increase in dopamine synthesis and turnover in striatum in vivo. rolipram induced a small increase in darpp-32 thr34 phosphorylation preferentially in striatopallidal neurons by activating adenosine a2a receptor signaling in striatum. in contrast, the pde10a inhibitor, papaverine, had no effect on th phosphorylation or dopamine turnover, but instead robustly increased darpp-32 thr34 and glur1 ser845 phosphorylation in striatal neurons. inhibition of pde10a by papaverine activated camp/pka signaling in both striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons, resulting in potentiation of dopamine d1 receptor signaling and inhibition of dopamine d2 receptor signaling. these biochemical results are supported by immunohistochemical data demonstrating differential localization of pde10a and pde4 in striatum. these data underscore the importance of individual brain-enriched cyclic-nucleotide pde isoforms as therapeutic targets for neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders affecting dopamine neurotransmission.
barrier coverage with line-based deployed mobile sensors abstract-adequate coverage is very important for sensor networks to fulfill the issued sensing tasks. in many working environments, it is necessary to make use of mobile sensors, which can move to the correct places to provide the required coverage. in this paper, we study the problem of placing mobile sensors to get high coverage. based on voronoi diagrams, we design two sets of distributed protocols for controlling the movement of sensors, one favoring communication and one favoring movement. in each set of protocols, we use voronoi diagrams to detect coverage holes and use one of three algorithms to calculate the target locations of sensors it holes exist. simulation results show the effectiveness of our protocols and give insight on choosing protocols and calculation algorithms under different application requirements and working conditions.
differentially private maximal frequent sequence mining sequential data is being increasingly used in a variety of applications. publishing sequential data is of vital importance to the advancement of these applications. however, as shown by the re-identification attacks on the aol and netflix datasets, releasing sequential data may pose considerable threats to individual privacy. recent research has indicated the failure of existing sanitization techniques to provide claimed privacy guarantees. it is therefore urgent to respond to this failure by developing new schemes with provable privacy guarantees. differential privacy is one of the only models that can be used to provide such guarantees. due to the inherent sequentiality and high-dimensionality, it is challenging to apply differential privacy to sequential data. in this paper, we address this challenge by employing a variable-length n-gram model, which extracts the essential information of a sequential database in terms of a set of variable-length n-grams. our approach makes use of a carefully designed exploration tree structure and a set of novel techniques based on the markov assumption in order to lower the magnitude of added noise. the published n-grams are useful for many purposes. furthermore, we develop a solution for generating a synthetic database, which enables a wider spectrum of data analysis tasks. extensive experiments on real-life datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques.
strategies for mining fungal natural products loss-of-function aspergillus nidulans ccla, a bre2 ortholog involved in histone h3 lysine 4 methylation, activated the expression of cryptic secondary metabolite clusters in a. nidulans. one new cluster generated monodictyphenone, emodin and emodin derivatives, whereas a second encoded two anti-osteoporosis polyketides, f9775a and f9775b. modification of the chromatin landscape in fungal secondary metabolite clusters allows for a simple technological means to express silent fungal secondary metabolite gene clusters.
finding new genes for non-syndromic hearing loss through an in silico prioritization study usher syndrome type 1 (ush1) is an autosomal recessive sensory defect involving congenital profound sensorineural deafness, vestibular dysfunction and blindness (due to progressive retinitis pigmentosa). six different ush1 loci have been reported. so far, only myo7a (ush1b), encoding myosin viia (ref. 2), has been identified as a gene whose mutation causes the disease. here, we report a gene underlying ush1c (mim 276904), a ush1 subtype described in a population of acadian descendants from louisiana and in a lebanese family. we identified this gene (ush1c), encoding a pdz-domain–containing protein, harmonin, in a subtracted mouse cdna library derived from inner ear sensory areas. in patients we found a splice-site mutation, a frameshift mutation and the expansion of an intronic variable number of tandem repeat (vntr). we showed that, in the mouse inner ear, only the sensory hair cells express harmonin. the inner ear ush1c transcripts predicted several harmonin isoforms, some containing an additional coiled-coil domain and a proline- and serine-rich region. as several of these transcripts were absent from the eye, we propose that ush1c also underlies the dfnb18 form of isolated deafness.
the escherichia coli phosphotyrosine proteome relates to core pathways and virulence stringent starvation protein a (sspa) of escherichia coli is an rna polymerase-associated transcriptional activator for the lytic development of phage p1 and is essential for stationary phase-induced acid tolerance of e. coli. we report the crystal structure of yersinia pestis sspa, which is 83% identical to e. coli sspa in amino acid sequence and is functionally complementary in supporting the lytic growth of phage p1 and acid resistance of an e. coli sspa mutant. the structure reveals that sspa assumes the characteristic fold of glutathione s-transferase (gst). however, sspa lacks gst activity and does not bind glutathione. three regions of sspa are flexible, the n and c termini and the α2-helix. the structure also reveals a conserved surface-exposed pocket composed of residues from a loop between helices α3 and α4. the functional roles of these structural features were investigated by assessing the ability of deletion and site-directed mutants to confer acid resistance of e. coli and to activate transcription from a phage p1 late promoter, thereby supporting the lytic growth of phage p1. the results indicate that the flexible regions are not critical for sspa function, whereas the surface pocket is important for both transcriptional activation of the phage p1 late promoter and acid resistance of e. coli. the size, shape, and property of the pocket suggest that it mediates protein-protein interactions. sspa orthologs from y. pestis, vibrio cholerae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa are all functional in acid resistance of e. coli, whereas only y. pestis sspa supports phage p1 growth.
placebo effects: clinical aspects and neurobiology. a bstract background transplantation of human embryonic dopamine neurons into the brains of patients with parkinson’s disease has proved beneficial in open clinical trials. however, whether this intervention would be more effective than sham surgery in a controlled trial is not known. methods we randomly assigned 40 patients who were 34 to 75 years of age and had severe parkinson’s disease (mean duration, 14 years) to receive a transplant of nerve cells or undergo sham surgery; all were to be followed in a double-blind manner for one year. in the transplant recipients, cultured mesencephalic tissue from four embryos was implanted into the putamen bilaterally. in the patients who underwent sham surgery, holes were drilled in the skull but the dura was not penetrated. the primary outcome was a subjective global rating of the change in the severity of disease, scored on a scale of –3.0 to 3.0 at one year, with negative scores indicating a worsening of symptoms and positive scores an improvement. results the mean (±sd) scores on the global rating scale for improvement or deterioration at one year were 0.0±2.1 in the transplantation group and ¡0.4± 1.7 in the sham-surgery group. among younger patients (60 years old or younger), standardized tests of parkinson’s disease revealed significant improvement in the transplantation group as compared with the sham-surgery group when patients were tested in the morning before receiving medication (p=0.01 for scores on the unified parkinson’s disease rating scale; p=0.006 for the schwab and england score). there was no significant improvement in older patients in the transplantation group. fiber outgrowth from the transplanted neurons was detected in 17 of the 20 patients in the transplantation group, as indicated by an increase in 18 f-fluorodopa uptake on positron-emission tomography or postmortem examination. after improvement in the first year, dystonia and dyskinesias recurred in 15 percent of the patients who received transplants, even after reduction or discontinuation of the dose of levodopa. conclusions human embryonic dopamine-neuron transplants survive in patients with severe parkinson’s disease and result in some clinical benefit in younger but not in older patients.

pesticide residues in some types of spices collated from libyan market a multi-residue solid-phase microextraction/gas chromatography/electron-capture detection method for pesticide screening (nine organochlorine, eleven organophosphorous and a tiadiazine insecticides, a benzoylurea acaricide and a halogenated sulfamide fungicide) in wine was developed. fiber coating, extraction time and temperature, exposure of the fiber to the headspace or to the liquid phase and the ethanol effect on pesticides extraction were the parameters studied. the best results were obtained for a 100 microm poly(dimethylsiloxane) fiber, with 30 min immersion, in a 3 ml sample, at 45 degrees c. pesticides extraction yield from aqueous spiked solutions was studied, for different ethanol concentrations (9%, 12.5% and 20%, v/v), which are representative of the main types of portuguese wines. calibration curves for extracted standards gave linear responses for all the pesticides, except dichlorvos, mevinphos, disulfoton and methidathion. average detection limits were lower than 5 ppb and no significant interference from the matrix was found in the conditions studied, except for buprofezin.
novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of candida infections: the potential of immunotherapy. background nosocomial bloodstream infections (bsis) are important causes of morbidity and mortality in the united states.   methods data from a nationwide, concurrent surveillance study (surveillance and control of pathogens of epidemiological importance [scope]) were used to examine the secular trends in the epidemiology and microbiology of nosocomial bsis.   results our study detected 24,179 cases of nosocomial bsi in 49 us hospitals over a 7-year period from march 1995 through september 2002 (60 cases per 10,000 hospital admissions). eighty-seven percent of bsis were monomicrobial. gram-positive organisms caused 65% of these bsis, gram-negative organisms caused 25%, and fungi caused 9.5%. the crude mortality rate was 27%. the most-common organisms causing bsis were coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (31% of isolates), staphylococcus aureus (20%), enterococci (9%), and candida species (9%). the mean interval between admission and infection was 13 days for infection with escherichia coli, 16 days for s. aureus, 22 days for candida species and klebsiella species, 23 days for enterococci, and 26 days for acinetobacter species. cons, pseudomonas species, enterobacter species, serratia species, and acinetobacter species were more likely to cause infections in patients in intensive care units (p<.001). in neutropenic patients, infections with candida species, enterococci, and viridans group streptococci were significantly more common. the proportion of s. aureus isolates with methicillin resistance increased from 22% in 1995 to 57% in 2001 (p<.001, trend analysis). vancomycin resistance was seen in 2% of enterococcus faecalis isolates and in 60% of enterococcus faecium isolates.   conclusion in this study, one of the largest multicenter studies performed to date, we found that the proportion of nosocomial bsis due to antibiotic-resistant organisms is increasing in us hospitals.
granule cell dispersion in temporal lobe epilepsy is associated with changes in dendritic orientation and spine distribution the distribution of granule cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation was studied in control autopsy and temporal lobe epilepsy (tle) specimens. in control tissue, the granule cell somata were closely approximated and formed a narrow lamina with a distinct, regular border with the molecular layer. in 11 of 15 tle specimens, the granule cell somata were dispersed and formed a wider than normal granule cell layer. the granule cell somata extended into the molecular layer to varying extents, creating an irregular boundary between the lamina. the dispersed granule cells were frequently aligned in columns, and many of these neurons displayed elongated bipolar forms. the extent of granule cell dispersion appeared to be related to the amount of cell loss in the polymorph layer of the dentate gyrus. granule cell dispersion was not consistently associated with granule cell loss although 5 of the 11 specimens with granule cell dispersion also showed moderate to marked granule cell loss. the most common features in the histories of the tle cases with granule cell dispersion were severe febrile seizures or seizures associated with meningitis or encephalitis during the first 4 years of life. the dispersion of the granule cells suggests that there has been some alteration in the patterns of cell migration in a subpopulation of cases with severe tle. the resultant ectopic positions of the granule cells could lead to changes in both the afferent and efferent connections of these neurons and, thus, contribute to the altered circuitry of the hippocampal formation in tle.

adenosine receptors as a biological pathway for the anti-inflammatory and beneficial effects of low frequency low energy pulsed electromagnetic fields an in vitro model was set up to investigate the effects of low frequency pulsed electromagnetic fields (pemf) and its induced electric fields on osteoblast cells under inflammatory conditions. osteoblasts (7f2) were seeded on top of chitosan scaffolds and co-cultured with macrophage cells (raw 264.7) growing on the bottom of culture wells, stimulated by lipopolysaccharide to release reactive oxygen species including nitric oxide (no). the co-culture was exposed to pemf (magnitude of the magnetic field = 1.5 mt; induced electric voltage = 2.5 mv; frequency = 75 hz; pulse duration = 1.3 ms) for 9 h. the osteoblasts were examined for their proliferation, viability, alkaline phosphatase (alp) activity, and genetic expressions of type i collagen (col i) and osteocalcin (oc), immediately and 7 days after pemf exposure (days 0 and 7). macrophage cell viability and no concentration in the medium were monitored before and after pemf exposure. the pemf-exposed co-culture released a significantly higher amount of no (65 µm) compared to control (17 µm) on day 7. despite the high level of no in the medium that was reported to be cytotoxic, pemf-exposed osteoblasts had enhanced cell proliferation (23%), viability (36%), and col i mrna expression (3.4-fold) compared to the controls. the osteoblasts subjected to the pemf had 41% less alp activity than the control, which was associated with the active cell proliferation and col i expression. the expression of oc mrna was not seen in either the pemf or control group, indicating cells had not entered the mineralization stage by day 7.
the implications of biomarker evidence for systematic reviews hilda bastian and colleagues examine the extent to which critical summaries of clinical trials can be used by health professionals and the public.
referential choices in a collaborative storytelling task: discourse stages and referential complexity matter in this study, children, young adults and elderly adults were tested in production and comprehension tasks assessing referential choice. our aims were (1) to determine whether speakers egocentrically base their referential choice on the preceding linguistic discourse or also take into account the perspective of a hypothetical listener and (2) whether the possible impact of perspective taking on referential choice changes with increasing age, with its associated changes in cognitive capacity. in the production task, participants described picture-based stories featuring two characters of the same gender, making it necessary to use unambiguous forms; in the comprehension task, participants interpreted potentially ambiguous pronouns at the end of similar orally presented stories. young adults (aged 18–35) were highly sensitive to the informational needs of hypothetical conversational partners in their production and comprehension of referring expressions. in contrast, children (aged 4–7) did not take into account possible conversational partners and tended to use pronouns for all given referents, leading to the production of ambiguous pronouns that are unrecoverable for a listener. this was mirrored in the outcome of the comprehension task, where children were insensitive to the shift of discourse topic marked by the speaker. the elderly adults (aged 69–87) behaved differently from both young adults and children. they showed a clear sensitivity to the other person's perspective in both production and comprehension, but appeared to lack the necessary cognitive capacities to keep track of the prominence of discourse referents, producing more potentially ambiguous pronouns than young adults, though fewer than children. in conclusion then, referential choice seems to depend on perspective taking in language, which develops with increasing linguistic experience and cognitive capacity, but also on the ability to keep track of the prominence of discourse referents, which is gradually lost with older age.
nitric oxide activates superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase to repress the cell death induced by wounding congeners of nitrogen monoxide (no) are neuroprotective and neurodestructive1– 7. to address this apparent paradox, we considered the effects on neurons of compounds characterized by alternative redox states of no: nitric oxide (no.) and nitrosonium ion (no+)8. nitric oxide, generated from no. donors or synthesized endogenously after nmda (n-methyl-d-aspartate) receptor activation, can lead to neurotoxicity3,4. here, we report that no.-mediated neurotoxicity is engendered, at least in part, by reaction with superoxide anion (o.-2), apparently leading to formation of peroxynitrite (onoo−), and not by no. alone. in contrast, the neuroprotective effects of no result from downregulation of nmda-receptor activity by reaction with thiol group(s) of the receptor's redox modulatory site1. this reaction is not mediated by no. itself, but occurs under conditions supporting s-nitrosylation of nmda receptor thiol (reaction or transfer of no+). moreover, the redox versatility of no allows for its interconversion from neuroprotective to neurotoxic species by a change in the ambient redox milieu. the details of this complex redox chemistry of no may provide a mechanism for harnessing neuroprotective effects and avoiding neurotoxicity in the central nervous system.
abnormal brain activity related to performance monitoring and error detection in children with adhd in visual go/nogo tasks the erp usually shows a frontal negativity after nogo stimuli ("nogo-n2"), which possibly reflects an inhibition process. however, the nogo-n2 appears to be very small after auditory stimuli, which is evidence against the inhibition hypothesis. in the present study we tested this hypothesis by evaluating performance differences between subjects. assuming that for ss with a high false alarm rate the inhibition process is weakened and/or delayed, they should reveal a smaller and/or later nogo-n2 than ss with a low false alarm rate. this prediction was confirmed, which supports the inhibition hypothesis. however, the nogo-n2 was again much smaller and had a different topography after auditory than after visual stimuli despite similar performance in both modalities. this modality asymmetry was explained by assuming that the inhibitory mechanism reflected in the nogo-n2 is located at a pre-motor rather than at the motor level. in the second part of the study we compared the nogo-n2 with a similar phenomenon, the error negativity (ne), which occurs in trials with commission errors (false alarms). earlier work suggests that the ne is a correlate of error detection or inhibition. this raises the possibility that the ne is a delayed nogo-n2, i.e., the ne may reflect a late and hence unsuccessful attempt to inhibit the response after a nontarget. however, the ne amplitude showed no difference between performance groups and stimulus modalities, as found for the nogo-n2. moreover, ne and nogo-n2 had different scalp topographies. this suggests that different mechanisms and generators underlie the ne and the nogo-n2.
the radish genome the testa of higher plant seeds protects the embryo against adverse environmental conditions. its role is assumed mainly by controlling germination through dormancy imposition and by limiting the detrimental activity of physical and biological agents during seed storage. to analyze the function of the testa in the model plant arabidopsis, we compared mutants affected in testa pigmentation and/or structure for dormancy, germination, and storability. the seeds of most mutants exhibited reduced dormancy. moreover, unlike wild-type testas, mutant testas were permeable to tetrazolium salts. these altered dormancy and tetrazolium uptake properties were related to defects in the pigmentation of the endothelium and its neighboring crushed parenchymatic layers, as determined by vanillin staining and microscopic observations. structural aberrations such as missing layers or a modified epidermal layer in specific mutants also affected dormancy levels and permeability to tetrazolium. both structural and pigmentation mutants deteriorated faster than the wild types during natural aging at room temperature, with structural mutants being the most strongly affected.
differences in helicobacter pylori caga tyrosine phosphorylation motif patterns between western and east asian strains, and influences on interleukin-8 secretion. helicobacter pylori is a causative agent of gastritis and peptic ulcer. caga+h. pylori strains are more virulent than caga− strains and are associated with gastric carcinoma. the caga gene product, caga, is injected by the bacterium into gastric epithelial cells and subsequently undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation. the phosphorylated caga specifically binds shp-2 phosphatase, activates the phosphatase activity, and thereby induces morphological transformation of cells. caga proteins of most western h. pylori isolates have a 34-amino acid sequence that variably repeats among different strains. here, we show that the repeat sequence contains a tyrosine phosphorylation site. caga proteins having more repeats were found to undergo greater tyrosine phosphorylation, to exhibit increased shp-2 binding, and to induce greater morphological changes. in contrast, predominant caga proteins specified by h. pylori strains isolated in east asia, where gastric carcinoma is prevalent, had a distinct tyrosine phosphorylation sequence at the region corresponding to the repeat sequence of western caga. this east asian-specific sequence conferred stronger shp-2 binding and morphologically transforming activities to western caga. finally, a critical amino acid residue that determines shp-2 binding activity among different caga proteins was identified. our results indicate that the potential of individual caga to perturb host-cell functions is determined by the degree of shp-2 binding activity, which depends in turn on the number and sequences of tyrosine phosphorylation sites. the presence of distinctly structured caga proteins in western and east asian h. pylori isolates may underlie the strikingly different incidences of gastric carcinoma in these two geographic areas.
bioinformatic landscapes for plant transcription factor system research comparative sequence analysis has significantly altered our view on the complexity of genome organization and gene functions in different kingdoms. plaza 3.0 is designed to make comparative genomics data for plants available through a user-friendly web interface. structural and functional annotation, gene families, protein domains, phylogenetic trees and detailed information about genome organization can easily be queried and visualized. compared with the first version released in 2009, which featured nine organisms, the number of integrated genomes is more than four times higher, and now covers 37 plant species. the new species provide a wider phylogenetic range as well as a more in-depth sampling of specific clades, and genomes of additional crop species are present. the functional annotation has been expanded and now comprises data from gene ontology, mapman, uniprotkb/swiss-prot, plntfdb and planttfdb. furthermore, we improved the algorithms to transfer functional annotation from well-characterized plant genomes to other species. the additional data and new features make plaza 3.0 (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/plaza/) a versatile and comprehensible resource for users wanting to explore genome information to study different aspects of plant biology, both in model and non-model organisms.
the minimum m3-m4 loop length of neurotransmitter-activated pentameric receptors is critical for the structural integrity of cytoplasmic portals* 1 a human recombinant homo‐oligomeric 5‐ht3 receptor (h5‐ht3a) expressed in a human embryonic kidney cell line (hek 293) was characterized using the whole‐cell recording configuration of the patch clamp technique. 2 5‐ht evoked transient inward currents (ec50= 3.4 μm; hill coefficient = 1.8) that were blocked by the 5‐ht3 receptor antagonist ondansetron (ic50= 103 pm) and by the non‐selective agents metoclopramide (ic50= 69 nm), cocaine (ic50= 459 nm) and (+)‐tubocurarine (ic50= 2.8 μm). 3 5‐ht‐induced currents rectified inwardly and reversed in sign (e5‐ht) at a potential of −2.2 mv. n‐methyl‐d‐glucamine was finitely permeant. permeability ratios pna/pcs and pnmdg/pcs were 0.90 and 0.083, respectively. 4 permeability towards divalent cations was assessed from measurements of e5‐ht in media where ca2+ and mg2+ replaced na+. pca/pcs and pmg/pcs were calculated to be 1.00 and 0.61, respectively. 5 single channel chord conductance (γ) estimated from fluctuation analysis of macroscopic currents increased with membrane hyperpolarization from 243 fs at −40 mv to 742 fs at −100 mv. 6 reducing [ca2+]o from 2 to 0.1 mm caused an increase in the whole‐cell current evoked by 5‐ht. a concomitant reduction in [mg2+]o produced further potentiation. fluctuation analysis indicates that a voltage‐independent augmentation of γ contributes to this phenomenon. 7 the data indicate that homo‐oligomeric receptors composed of h5‐ht3a subunits form inwardly rectifying cation‐selective ion channels of low conductance that are permeable to ca2+ and mg2+.
nnll-fast: predictions for coloured supersymmetric particle production at the lhc with threshold and coulomb resummation abstract in qcd hard scattering cross sections, the color content of the underlying hard scattering evolves with a factorization scale. this evolution is controlled by an anomalous dimension matrix, specific to each hard-scattering reaction. anomalous dimensions are determined from the renormalization of products of ordered exponentials of the gauge field, which describe the coherent radiation of gluons by incoming hadrons and the observed jets or particles of the final state. the anomalous dimensions depend on the kinematics of the underlying hard scattering, but are free of collinear singularities. a number of these matrices are available in the literature. here, we exhibit one-loop mixing matrices for the full list of 2 → 2 reactions involving light quarks and gluons. the eight-by-eight anomalous dimension matrix for gluon-gluon scattering shows a simplified structure in the basis corresponding to definite color exchange in the t -channel.
a comparator-based rail clamp two esd clamp circuit design techniques have been developed to reduce cell size and to combat the effects of gate leakage that have become significant in recent generations of digital cmos process technology. such clamps have proven to be able to withstand hbm stresses of 6kv and cdm pulses of 1.2kv.
cost-benefit arbitration between multiple reinforcement-learning systems a broad range of neural and behavioral data suggests that the brain contains multiple systems for behavioral choice, including one associated with prefrontal cortex and another with dorsolateral striatum. however, such a surfeit of control raises an additional choice problem: how to arbitrate between the systems when they disagree. here, we consider dual-action choice systems from a normative perspective, using the computational theory of reinforcement learning. we identify a key trade-off pitting computational simplicity against the flexible and statistically efficient use of experience. the trade-off is realized in a competition between the dorsolateral striatal and prefrontal systems. we suggest a bayesian principle of arbitration between them according to uncertainty, so each controller is deployed when it should be most accurate. this provides a unifying account of a wealth of experimental evidence about the factors favoring dominance by either system.

effect of exercise intensity on post-exercise oxygen consumption and heart rate recovery the on‐ and off‐transient (i.e. phase ii) responses of pulmonary oxygen uptake (v̇o2) to moderate‐intensity exercise (i.e. below the lactate threshold, θl) in humans has been shown to conform to both mono‐exponentiality and ‘on‐off’ symmetry, consistent with a system manifesting linear control dynamics. however above θl the v̇o2 kinetics have been shown to be more complex: during high‐intensity exercise neither mono‐exponentiality nor ‘on‐off’ symmetry have been shown to appropriately characterise the v̇o2 response. muscle [phosphocreatine] ([pcr]) responses to exercise, however, have been proposed to be dynamically linear with respect to work rate, and to demonstrate ‘on‐off’ symmetry at all work intenisties. we were therefore interested in examining the kinetic characteristics of the v̇o2 and [pcr] responses to moderate‐ and high‐intensity knee‐extensor exercise in order to improve our understanding of the factors involved in the putative phosphate‐linked control of muscle oxygen consumption. we estimated the dynamics of intramuscular [pcr] simultaneously with those of v̇o2 in nine healthy males who performed repeated bouts of both moderate‐ and high‐intensity square‐wave, knee‐extension exercise for 6 min, inside a whole‐body magnetic resonance spectroscopy (mrs) system. a transmit‐receive surface coil placed under the right quadriceps muscle allowed estimation of intramuscular [pcr]; v̇o2 was measured breath‐by‐breath using a custom‐designed turbine and a mass spectrometer system. for moderate exercise, the kinetics were well described by a simple mono‐exponential function (following a short cardiodynamic phase for v̇o2,), with time constants (τ) averaging: τv̇o2,on 35 ± 14 s (±s.d.), τ[pcr]on 33 ± 12 s, τv̇o2,off 50 ± 13 s and τ[pcr]off 51 ± 13 s. the kinetics for both v̇o2 and [pcr] were more complex for high‐intensity exercise. the fundamental phase expressing average τ values of τv̇o2,on 39 ± 4 s, τ[pcr]on 38 ± 11 s, τv̇o2,off 51 ± 6 s and τ[pcr]off 47 ± 11 s. an associated slow component was expressed in the on‐transient only for both v̇o2 and [pcr], and averaged 15.3 ± 5.4 and 13.9 ± 9.1 % of the fundamental amplitudes for v̇o2 and [pcr], respectively. in conclusion, the τ values of the fundamental component of [pcr] and v̇o2 dynamics cohere to within 10 %, during both the on‐ and off‐transients to a constant‐load work rate of both moderate‐ and high‐intensity exercise. on average, ≈90 % of the magnitude of the v̇o2 slow component during high‐intensity exercise is reflected within the exercising muscle by its [pcr] response.

inhibition of nf-κb prevents the acidic bile-induced oncogenic mrna phenotype, in human hypopharyngeal cells gastroesophageal reflux (ger) has been strongly associated with carcinogenesis of the lower esophagus and development of several otolaryngologic disorders. epidemiologic studies support concept that the malignant transformation of laryngeal mucosal surfaces is due to ger-initiated chronic laryngeal inflammation. however, large clinical studies with matched control groups and further experimental investigations are necessary to ascertain the relationship between reflux and laryngeal carcinoma. this review stresses that early diagnosis of ger disease, based on clinical suspicion, ambulatory 24-hour double-probe ph monitoring, and endoscopic examination, as well as effective treatment of reflux, are considered the keys for relief of symptomatology and preventing the chronic irritation of the laryngeal mucosa that may contribute to the development of laryngeal carcinoma.
an approach of top-k keyword querying for fuzzy xml keyword search enables web users to easily access xml data without the need to learn a structured query language and to study possibly complex data schemas. existing work has addressed the problem of selecting qualified data nodes that match keywords and connecting them in a meaningful way, in the spirit of inferring a where clause in xquery. however, how to infer the return clause for keyword search is an open problem.  to address this challenge, we present an xml keyword search engine, xseek, to infer the semantics of the search and identify return nodes effectively. xseek recognizes possible entities and attributes inherently represented in the data. it also distinguishes between search predicates and return specifications in the keywords. then based on the analysis of both xml data structures and keyword match patterns, xseek generates return nodes. extensive experimental studies show the effectiveness of xseek.
epidermoid cysts of the cerebellopontine angle with extension into the middle and anterior cranial fossae: surgical strategy and review of the literature objective epidermoid tumors have similar radiologic characteristics with arachnoid cysts on routine imaging techniques. since they warrant different therapeutic interventions, it is essential to differentiate the two pathologies and to assess operative results.   purpose the purpose of this study is to define the mr characteristics of epidermoid tumors in posterior fossa particularly on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (flair) and diffusion-weighted imaging (dwi).   patients and methods during a 10-year period, we operated 19 cases with epidermoid tumor of posterior fossa. the localization of the epidermoids was cerebellopontine angle in 16 patients, within the fourth ventricle in 2 patients and pineal region in 1 patient. neuroimaging included ct in all patients, conventional mr in 14 patients and flair and dwi in the last 6 patients.   results in the first 13 cases, diagnosis of epidermoid tumor was difficult on ct and conventional mr. epidermoids appeared as heterogeneous hyperintense lesions on flair and homogenous hyperintense lesions on dwi in the last 6 patients. while total resection of the tumor was achieved in 17 patients, subtotal resection was performed in 2 patients. histopathological examinations of the specimens revealed epidermoid tumor in all cases.   conclusion advances in neuroradiology provide us advantages for planning the treatment modalities in epidermoid tumors of the posterior fossa. the difficulties in preoperative differential diagnosis and judgment for reoperation in the postoperative course have been decreased particularly via flair and dwi.
influence of host plant-derived and abiotic environmental parameters on the composition of the diazotroph assemblage associated with roots of juncus roemerianus the degree of host specificity of most plant root associated bacteria is poorly under- stood. in this study we examined the physiological diversity of oxygen utilizing, culturable dia- zotrophs from the rhizoplane of the high marsh perennial glasswort salicornia virginica and com- pared them to diazotrophs from other salt marsh plants (tall and short spartina alterniflora, juncus roemerianus, and spartina patens) from the same ecosystem. forty-six pure culture strains were recovered from the rhizoplane of s. virginica by stab inoculating freshly collected roots into com- bined nitrogen-free semi-solid media, followed by streak plating of clonal outgrowths. the majority of these strains were gram-negative obligately aerobic or microaerophilic rods, but 3 gram-positive strains were also isolated and characterized. api 20ne test strips were used for preliminary charac- terization of all strains, yielding 22 physiologically different api strain groups. one representative strain was selected from each api group and tested for the presence of nifh, denoting strains capa- ble of n2-fixation. seventeen strains (14 gram-negative, 3 gram-positive) were nifh-positive and were characterized further using biolog test plates. four well-supported strain clusters were iden- tified by bootstrapped cluster analysis of the biolog substrate utilization profiles. these clusters differed in utilization of carbohydrates, carboxylic acids, and amino acids. s. virginica diazotrophs were physiologically quite different from rhizoplane diazotrophs from the low marsh plants s. alterni- flora and j. roemerianus, but much more similar to diazotrophs from another high marsh plant, s. patens. we hypothesize that the observed physiological differentiation between high marsh and low marsh diazotrophs reflects differences in selection pressures in the rhizoplane microenvironment produced by plants with differing abilities to ventilate the rhizosphere. in addition, high and low marsh branches were further resolved into host-specific strain clusters, which also implies a strong impact of other host features, such as the suite of carbon exudate compounds produced, on the dis- tributions of specific diazotroph strains. these findings imply endemic, host-specific distributions of salt marsh diazotrophs and are consistent with the great diversity of diazotrophs that have been observed in this ecosystem to date.
mechanisms of priming of pop-out: stored representations or feature-gain modulations? learning and memory of novel spatial configurations aids behaviors such as visual search through an implicit process called contextual cuing (m. m. chun & y. jiang, 1998). the present study provides rigorous tests of the implicit nature ofcontextual cuing. experiment 1 used a recognition test that closely matched the learning task, confirming that memory traces of predictive spatial context were not accessible to conscious retrieval. experiment 2 gave explicit instructions to encode visual context during learning, but learning was not improved and conscious memory remained undetectable. experiment 3 illustrates that memory traces for spatial context may persist for at least 1 week, suggesting along-term component of contextual cuing. these experiments indicate that the learning and memory of spatial context in the contextual cuing task are indeed implicit. the results have implications for understanding the neural substrate of spatial contextual learning, which may depend on an intact medial temporal lobe system that includes the hippocampus (mi. m. chun & e. a. phelps, 1999).
ebf factors drive expression of multiple classes of target genes governing neuronal development neuronal specification is often seen as a multistep process: earlier regulators confer broad neuronal identity and are followed by combinatorial codes specifying neuronal properties unique to specific subtypes. however, it is still unclear whether early regulators are re-deployed in subtype-specific combinatorial codes, and whether early patterning events act to restrict the developmental potential of postmitotic cells. here, we use the differential peptidergic fate of two lineage-related peptidergic neurons in the drosophila ventral nerve cord to show how, in a feedforward mechanism, earlier determinants become critical players in later combinatorial codes. amongst the progeny of neuroblast 5–6 are two peptidergic neurons: one expresses fmrfamide and the other one expresses nplp1 and the dopamine receptor dopr. we show the hlh gene collier functions at three different levels to progressively restrict neuronal identity in the 5–6 lineage. at the final step, collier is the critical combinatorial factor that differentiates two partially overlapping combinatorial codes that define fmrfamide versus nplp1/dopr identity. misexpression experiments reveal that both codes can activate neuropeptide gene expression in vast numbers of neurons. despite their partially overlapping composition, we find that the codes are remarkably specific, with each code activating only the proper neuropeptide gene. these results indicate that a limited number of regulators may constitute a potent combinatorial code that dictates unique neuronal cell fate, and that such codes show a surprising disregard for many global instructive cues.
the reaction of the pelvis to the implantation of the acetabular component of the hip endoprosthesis--initial tests with the use of computerized tomography. thirty-four hips in which there had been prosthetic replacement were selected for study because of the presence of linear (diffuse) or lytic (localized) areas of periprosthetic bone loss. in all hips, there was careful documentation of the anatomical location of the material that had been obtained for histological analysis, and the specific purpose of the removal of the tissue was for examination to determine the cause of the resorption of bone. specimens from twenty-three hips were retrieved during an operation and from eleven hips, at autopsy. the area of bone loss was linear only in sixteen hips, lytic only in thirteen, and both linear and lytic in five. in all thirty-four hips, intracellular particulate debris was found in the macrophages that were present in the area of bone resorption. all thirty-four had intracellular particles of polyethylene, many of which were less than one micrometer in size. thirty-one hips had extracellular particles of polyethylene as well. twenty-two of the thirty-four hips had intracellular metallic debris; in ten, metallic debris was found extracellularly as well. ten of the sixteen cemented specimens had intracellular and extracellular polymethylmethacrylate debris. in the mechanically stable prostheses--cemented and uncemented--polyethylene wear debris was identified in areas of bone resorption far from the articular surfaces. the number of macrophages in a microscopic field was directly related to the amount of particulate polyethylene debris that was visible by light microscopy. although the gross radiographic appearances of linear bone loss and lytic bone loss were different, the histological appearance of the regions in which there was active bone resorption was similar. regardless of the radiographic appearance and anatomical origin of the specimen, bone resorption was found to occur in association with macrophages that were laden with polyethylene debris. in general, the number of macrophages present had a direct relationship to the degree of bone resorption that was seen. we believe that these findings indicate that joint fluid penetrates far more extensively than previously thought, even in a well fixed component, along the interface between the prosthesis and bone and in the periprosthetic tissues; it is often more extensive than is shown by arthrography. we therefore suggest the concept of the effective joint space to include all periprosthetic regions that are accessible to joint fluid and thus accessible to particulate debris.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
biofilter performance and characterization of a biocatalyst degrading alkylbenzene gases a biological trickling filter for treatment of toluene-containing waste gas was studied. the overall kinetics of the biofilm growth was followed in the early growth phase. a rapid initial colonization took place during the first three days. the biofilm thickness increased exponentially, whereas the incease of active biomass and polymers was linear. in order to investigate the toluene degradation, various toluene degraders from the multispecies biofilm were isolated, and a pseudomonas putida was chosen as a representative of the toluene-degrading population. a specific rrna oligonucleotide probe was used to follow the toluene-degrading p. putida in the multispecies biofilm in the filter by means of number and cellular rrna content. p. putida appeared to detach from the biofilm during the first three days of growth, after which p. putida was found at a constant level of 10% of the active biomass in the biofilm. based on the rrna content, the in situ activity was estimated to be reduced to 20% of cells grown at maximum conditions in batch culture. the toluene degraded by p. putida was estimated to be a minor part (11%) of the overall toluene degradation.
effect of diet and exercise on body composition, energy intake and leptin levels in overweight women and men purpose the purpose of this study was to examine the physiological effects of a weight-loss dietary regimen with or without exercise.   methods thirty-five overweight men were matched and randomly placed into either a control group (c; n = 6) or one of three dietary groups; a diet-only group (d; n = 8), a diet group that performed aerobic exercise three times per week (de; n = 11); and a diet group that performed both aerobic and strength training three times per week (des; n = 10).   results after 12 wk, d, de, and des demonstrated a similar and significant (p < or = 0.05) reduction in body mass (-9.64, -8.99, and -9.90 kg, respectively) with fat mass comprising 69, 78, and 97% of the total loss in body mass, respectively. the diet-only group also demonstrated a significant reduction in fat-free mass. maximum strength, as determined by 1-rm testing in the bench press and squat exercise was significantly increased for des in both the bench press (+19.6%) and squat exercise (+32.6%). absolute peak o2 consumption was significantly elevated in de (+24.8%) and des (+15.4%). there were no differences in performance during a 30-s wingate test for the de and des, whereas d demonstrated a significant decline in peak and mean power output. resting metabolic rate (rmr) (kcal x d(-1)) was not significantly different for any of the groups except for the de group. there were no significant changes in basal concentrations of serum glucose, bun, cortisol, testosterone, and high density lipoprotein (hdl) cholesterol for any of the groups. serum total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol were significantly decreased for all dietary groups. serum triglycerides were significantly reduced for d and des at week 6 and remained lower at week 12 for d, while triglycerides returned to baseline values for des.   conclusions these data indicate that a weight-loss dietary regimen in conjunction with aerobic and resistance exercise prevents the normal decline in fat-free mass and muscular power and augments body composition, maximal strength, and maximum oxygen consumption compared with weight-loss induced by diet alone.
nmda receptor antagonist effects, cortical glutamatergic function, and schizophrenia: toward a paradigm shift in medication development the classical dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia postulates a hyperactivity of dopaminergic transmission at the d(2) receptor. we measured in vivo occupancy of striatal d(2) receptors by dopamine in 18 untreated patients with schizophrenia and 18 matched controls, by comparing d(2) receptor availability before and during pharmacologically induced acute dopamine depletion. acute depletion of intrasynaptic dopamine resulted in a larger increase in d(2) receptor availability in patients with schizophrenia (19% +/- 11%) compared with control subjects (9% +/- 7%, p = 0.003). the increased occupancy of d(2) receptors by dopamine occurred both in first-episode neuroleptic-naive patients and in previously treated chronic patients experiencing an episode of illness exacerbation. in addition, elevated synaptic dopamine was predictive of good treatment response of positive symptoms to antipsychotic drugs. this finding provides direct evidence of increased stimulation of d(2) receptors by dopamine in schizophrenia, consistent with increased phasic activity of dopaminergic neurons.
chemobrain experienced by breast cancer survivors: a meta-ethnography study investigating research and care implications aims and objectives to investigate women's awareness of chemotherapy-induced cognitive changes, their perception of cognitive limitations in carrying out daily tasks and subsequent return to work decisions and perceptions of work ability.   background evidence suggests that women diagnosed with breast cancer experience cognitive changes as a consequence of chemotherapy treatment. although these changes tend to be subtle deficits in memory, concentration and the ability to organise information, there has been no published research identifying how they can impact patient's ability to work and subsequent employment decisions.   design this was a qualitative study.   method data were collected from breast cancer survivors using semi-structured interviews with two focus groups (n = 6, n = 7). interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using template analysis.   results data were categorised into four main themes: (1) awareness of cognitive changes during and following chemotherapy, (2) cognitive ability and confidence in return to work, (3) impact of cognitive changes on work ability and (4) information on the cognitive side effects of chemotherapy.   conclusions the views and experiences of breast cancer survivors towards returning to work and subsequent work ability were affected by chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment. more specifically the appraisal of returning to work and ability to manage work were influenced by three interrelated factors: (1) actual cognitive ability following chemotherapy, (2) awareness of cognitive failures by the women and their families and (3) the subsequent impact on their confidence in carrying out daily tasks including work tasks.   relevance to clinical practice more information and support is needed to help patients with cancer to manage chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairments in home and workplace. nurses are increasingly asked about the impact of cancer and its treatment on work and are therefore well positioned to offer this advice. subsequently, nurses require additional knowledge and guidance to provide this information and support.
ecological networks--beyond food webs. network analysis is distinguished from traditional social science by the dyadic nature of the standard data set. whereas in traditional social science we study monadic attributes of individuals, in network analysis we study dyadic attributes of pairs of individuals. these dyadic attributes (e.g. social relations) may be represented in matrix form by a square 1-mode matrix. in contrast, the data in traditional social science are represented as 2-mode matrices. however, network analysis is not completely divorced from traditional social science, and often has occasion to collect and analyze 2-mode matrices. furthermore, some of the methods developed in network analysis have uses in analysing non-network data. this paper presents and discusses ways of applying and interpreting traditional network analytic techniques to 2-mode data, as well as developing new techniques. three areas are covered in detail: displaying 2-mode data as networks, detecting clusters and measuring centrality.

bone health and aldosterone excess adrenal vein sampling (avs) is fundamental for subtype diagnosis in patients with primary aldosteronism. avs protocols vary between centers, especially for diagnostic indices and for use of adrenocorticotropic hormone (acth) stimulation. we investigated the role of both continuous acth infusion and bolus on the performance and interpretation of avs in a sample of 76 patients with confirmed primary aldosteronism. in 36 primary aldosteronism patients, avs was performed both under basal conditions and after continuous acth infusion, and in 40 primary aldosteronism patients, avs was performed both under basal conditions and after acth iv bolus. both acth protocols determined an increase in the rate of successful cannulation of the adrenal veins. both acth infusion and bolus determined a significant increase in selectivity index for the right adrenal vein and acth bolus for the left adrenal vein. lateralization index was not significantly different after continuous acth infusion and iv bolus. in 88% and 78% of the patients, the diagnosis obtained was the same before and after acth infusion and iv bolus, respectively. however, the reproducibility of the diagnosis was reduced using less stringent criteria for successful cannulation of the adrenal veins. this study shows that acth use during avs may be of help for centers with lower success rates, because a successful adrenal cannulation is more easily obtained with this protocol; moreover, this technique performs at least as well as the unstimulated strategy and in some cases may be even better. stringent criteria for cannulation should be used to have a high consistency of the diagnosis.
number of days required to estimate habitual activity using wrist-worn geneactiv accelerometer: a cross-sectional study purpose to examine sources of variance in objective measures of physical activity in a group of healthy adults (n = 92) participating in a physical activity measurement study.   methods physical activity was assessed for up to 21 consecutive days using the computer science applications (csa) accelerometer. day-of-the-week effects were evaluated for activity counts (ct.min(-1).d(-1), ct.d(-1)) and time (min.d(-1)) spent in inactivity (0-499 ct), moderate-1 (500-1951 ct), and moderate-2-vigorous activity (> or =1952 ct). random effects models were employed to estimate variance components for subject, day of the week, and residual error from which the number of days of assessment required to achieve 80% reliability were estimated.   results physical inactivity was lower on weekend days, and saturday was the least inactive day of the week for both men and women. inter-individual variation, or differences between subjects, was proportionally the largest source of variance (55-60% of total) in accelerometer counts and time spent in moderate to vigorous activity. differences within subjects (intra-individual variation) accounted for 30-45% of the overall variance, and day-of-the-week effects accounted for 1-8%. for activity counts, and time spent in moderate to vigorous activity, at least 3-4 d of monitoring were required to achieve 80% reliability. reliable measures of physical inactivity required at least 7 d of monitoring.   conclusion these findings provide insight for understanding the behavioral variability in the activity patterns of adults and suggest that reliable measures of activity behaviors require at least 7 d of monitoring.
human intestinal fatty acid binding protein 2 expression is associated with fat intake and polymorphisms. the intestinal mucosa metabolizes fatty acids differently when presented to the lumenal or basolateral membrane. expression of both liver and intestinal fatty acid binding proteins (l- and i-fabps) uniquely in the enterocyte offers a possible explanation of this phenomenon. an organ explant system was used to analyze the relative binding of fatty acids to each protein. more fatty acid was bound to l-fabp than to i-fabps (28% vs. 6% of cytosolic radioactivity), no matter on which side the fatty acid was added. however, a 2-3-fold increase in fatty acid binding to the intestinal paralog was noted after apical addition of palmitic or oleic acid in mucosa from chow fed rats. when oleic acid was added apically, a 1.4-fold increase in binding to i-fabp was observed in mucosa derived from chronically fat fed rats, consistent with the previously observed 50% increase in the content of that protein. immunocytochemical localization of both fabps in vivo demonstrated an apical cytoplasmic localization in the fasting state, and redistribution to the entire cytoplasm after fat feeding. these data are consistent with the hypothesis that i-fabp may contribute to the metabolic compartmentalization of apically presented fatty acids in the intestine.
atp hydrolysis provides functions that promote rejection of pairings between different copies of long repeated sequences ideally, self-assembly should rapidly and efficiently produce stable correctly assembled structures. we study the tradeoff between enthalpic and entropic cost in self-assembling systems using reca-mediated homology search as an example. earlier work suggested that reca searches could produce stable final structures with high stringency using a slow testing process that follows an initial rapid search of ∼9-15 bases. in this work, we will show that as a result of entropic and enthalpic barriers, simultaneously testing all ∼9-15 bases as separate individual units results in a longer overall searching time than testing them in groups and stages.

higher education dominance and siloed knowledge: a systematic review of flipped classroom research recent calls for educational reform highlight ongoing concerns about the ability of current curricula to equip aspiring health care professionals with the skills for success. whereas a wide range of proposed solutions attempt to address apparent deficiencies in current educational models, a growing body of literature consistently points to the need to rethink the traditional in-class, lecture-based course model. one such proposal is the flipped classroom, in which content is offloaded for students to learn on their own, and class time is dedicated to engaging students in student-centered learning activities, like problem-based learning and inquiry-oriented strategies. in 2012, the authors flipped a required first-year pharmaceutics course at the university of north carolina eshelman school of pharmacy. they offloaded all lectures to self-paced online videos and used class time to engage students in active learning exercises. in this article, the authors describe the philosophy and methodology used to redesign the basic pharmaceutics ii course and outline the research they conducted to investigate the resulting outcomes. this article is intended to serve as a guide to instructors and educational programs seeking to develop, implement, and evaluate innovative and practical strategies to transform students’ learning experience. as class attendance, students’ learning, and the perceived value of this model all increased following participation in the flipped classroom, the authors conclude that this approach warrants careful consideration as educators aim to enhance learning, improve outcomes, and fully equip students to address 21st-century health care needs.
interpretable convolutional neural networks detecting objects becomes difficult when we need to deal with large shape deformation, occlusion and low resolution. we propose a novel approach to i) handle large deformations and partial occlusions in animals (as examples of highly deformable objects), ii) describe them in terms of body parts, and iii) detect them when their body parts are hard to detect (e.g., animals depicted at low resolution). we represent the holistic object and body parts separately and use a fully connected model to arrange templates for the holistic object and body parts. our model automatically decouples the holistic object or body parts from the model when they are hard to detect. this enables us to represent a large number of holistic object and body part combinations to better deal with different "detectability" patterns caused by deformations, occlusion and/or low resolution. we apply our method to the six animal categories in the pascal voc dataset and show that our method significantly improves state-of-the-art (by 4.1% ap) and provides a richer representation for objects. during training we use annotations for body parts (e.g., head, torso, etc.), making use of a new dataset of fully annotated object parts for pascal voc 2010, which provides a mask for each part.
the effect of nmda receptors on gain modulation shunting inhibition, a conductance increase with a reversal potential close to the resting potential of the cell, has been shown to have a divisive effect on subthreshold excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitudes. it has therefore been assumed to have the same divisive effect on firing rates. we show that shunting inhibition actually has a subtractive effecton the firing rate in most circumstances. averaged over several interspike intervals, the spiking mechanism effectively clamps the somatic membrane potential to a value significantly above the resting potential, so that the current through the shunting conductance is approximately independent of the firing rate. this leads to a subtractive rather than a divisive effect. in addition, at distal synapses, shunting inhibition will also have an approximately subtractive effect if the excitatory conductance is not small compared to the inhibitory conductance. therefore regulating a cell's passive membrane conductancefor instance, via massive feedbackis not an adequate mechanism for normalizing or scaling its output.
the challenges of breastfeeding in a complex world a critical aims the study investigated factors empowering women to continue breastfeeding despite experiencing extraordinary difficulties. the study documented the experiences and characteristics of women who continued to breastfeed (continuing cohort) and those who weaned (non-continuing cohort) despite extraordinary difficulties.   design retrospective case control.   methods the study was undertaken in south-east queensland, australia in 2004. forty women (20 in each cohort) were recruited over six months. both quantitative (breastfeeding knowledge questionnaire) and qualitative (semi-structured interviews) data were collected. this paper describes the qualitative data.   results women from both cohorts expressed idealistic expectations about breastfeeding and experienced psychological distress due to their breastfeeding problems. those who continued breastfeeding used coping strategies and exhibited personal qualities that assisted them to overcome the difficulties experienced. women who continued to breastfeed were more likely to report relying on a health professional they could trust for support. this latter cohort were also more likely to report having peers with which they shared their experiences. non-continuing women expressed feelings of guilt and inadequacy following weaning and were more likely to feel isolated.   conclusions this study has highlighted the methods women use to deal with breastfeeding problems. it has also revealed modificable factors that can improve breastfeeding duration.   relevance to clinical practice the findings indicate that clinicians should: *provide information which accurately reflects the breastfeeding experience; *ensure systems are in place so that effective postnatal support for breastfeeding difficulties is available; *consider screening to ascertain levels of psychological distress, sadness and disillusionment among breastfeeding women; *design educational interventions with elements of cognitive skills, problem-solving and self-efficacy training to equip women with the skills to overcome any experienced difficulties.
prevalence of depression and its correlations: a cross-sectional study in thai cancer patients. increased survival rates resulting from advances in the treatment of cancer have led to an increased interest in patients' emotional reactions and adaptations to the illness. depressive symptoms associated with cancer range from normal sadness through acute stress response to major depression. chemotherapeutic agents can produce depressive and other neurotoxic side effects. diagnosis of common emotional reactions to cancer illness and appropriate management are described. such treatment can enhance the patient's ability to adapt to the disease and tolerate its treatments.
car t cells targeting podoplanin reduce orthotopic glioblastomas in mouse brains the cancer genome atlas network recently cataloged recurrent genomic abnormalities in glioblastoma multiforme (gbm). we describe a robust gene expression-based molecular classification of gbm into proneural, neural, classical, and mesenchymal subtypes and integrate multidimensional genomic data to establish patterns of somatic mutations and dna copy number. aberrations and gene expression of egfr, nf1, and pdgfra/idh1 each define the classical, mesenchymal, and proneural subtypes, respectively. gene signatures of normal brain cell types show a strong relationship between subtypes and different neural lineages. additionally, response to aggressive therapy differs by subtype, with the greatest benefit in the classical subtype and no benefit in the proneural subtype. we provide a framework that unifies transcriptomic and genomic dimensions for gbm molecular stratification with important implications for future studies.
type 2 rhinovirus infection of cultured human tracheal epithelial cells: role of ldl receptor. we have previously reported that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) enhances expression of interleukin-6, collagenase, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and basic fibroblast growth factor genes in human omental microvascular endothelial (home) cells in culture. in this study, we found that treatment of home cells with tnf-alpha or interleukin-1 (il-1) caused enhanced expression of low density lipoprotein (ldl) receptor. a few-fold increase in both ldl binding activity and the receptor mrna levels was observed when home cells were treated with either tnf-alpha or il-1. northern blot analysis showed that cellular expression of ldl receptor gene was significantly increased 12-24 h after exposure to tnf-alpha. no significant changes in the life-span of ldl receptor mrna were observed in untreated and tnf-alpha-treated cells. scatchard analysis showed an increased receptor number for ldl in tnf-alpha-treated cells. parallel to increased ldl binding activity, internalization and degradation of ldl were also increased in home cells treated with tnf-alpha or il-1. tnf-alpha-induced enhancement of ldl receptor gene expression was not observed when cycloheximide was present. cellular mrna level of sp-1 gene was increased about 3-4-fold at 12 h after treatment with tnf-alpha. nuclear run-on assays showed increased transcription of ldl receptor gene as well as sp-1 gene by tnf-alpha. gel retardation assay with the sp-1 consensus fragment showed that sp-1 binding activity was increased about 4-5-fold 12-24 h after treatment with tnf-alpha. nf-kb binding activity was also dramatically increased, but there is no nf-kb motif on the promoter for ldl receptor gene. the induction of ldl receptor by tnf might be mediated through a transcription factor, sp-1.
biochemical modulation of growth, lipid quality and productivity in mixotrophic cultures of chlorella sorokiniana microalgal oils have attracted much interest as potential feedstocks for renewable fuels, yet our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms controlling oil biosynthesis and storage in microalgae is rather limited. using chlamydomonas reinhardtii as a model system, we show here that starch, rather than oil, is the dominant storage sink for reduced carbon under a wide variety of conditions. in short-term treatments, significant amounts of oil were found to be accumulated concomitantly with starch only under conditions of n starvation, as expected, or in cells cultured with high acetate in otherwise standard growth medium. time-course analysis revealed that oil accumulation under n starvation lags behind that of starch and rapid oil synthesis occurs only when carbon supply exceeds the capacity of starch synthesis. in the starchless mutant bafj5, blocking starch synthesis results in significant increases in the extent and rate of oil accumulation. in the parental strain, but not the starchless mutant, oil accumulation under n starvation was strictly dependent on the available external acetate supply and the amount of oil increased steadily as the acetate concentration increased to the levels several-fold higher than that of the standard growth medium. additionally, oil accumulation under n starvation is saturated at low light intensities and appears to be largely independent of de novo protein synthesis. collectively, our results suggest that carbon availability is a key metabolic factor controlling oil biosynthesis and carbon partitioning between starch and oil in chlamydomonas.
a novel uplc–ms–ms method for simultaneous determination of seven uremic retention toxins with cardiovascular relevance in chronic kidney disease patients background stage 5 chronic kidney disease (ckd) is associated with enhanced aortic calcification. the aim of this study was to determine if the administration of indoxyl sulphate (is), a uraemic toxin, stimulates the progression of aortic calcification.   methods the rat groups consisted of (i) dahl salt-resistant normotensive rats (dr) with intake of 0.3% salt, (ii) dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive rats (ds) with intake of 2.0% salt and (iii) dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive is-administered rats (ds-is) with intake of 2.0% salt and 200 mg/kg of is in water. after 30 weeks, their aortic and kidney tissues were excised for histological and immunohistochemical analyses.   results severe vascular calcification was observed by von kossa staining in the arcuate aorta of all the ds-is rats, but hardly in ds or dr rats. immunohistochemistry demonstrated that osteopontin, core binding factor 1 (cbfal), alkaline phosphatase (alp), osteocalcin, is and organic anion transporter (oat) 3 were colocalized in the cells embedded in the aortic calcification area of ds-is rats. wall thickness was significantly increased in arcuate, thoracic and abdominal aortas of ds-is rats compared with ds and dr rats. ds-is rats showed significantly increased extent of glomerular hypertrophy, mesangial expansion, masson's trichrome-positive tubulointerstitial area and glomerular and tubulointerstitial expression of transforming growth factor-ssl as compared with ds and dr rats.   conclusions is induced aortic calcification with expression of osteoblast-specific proteins and aortic wall thickening. is is not only a nephrotoxin but also a vascular toxin, and may contribute to the progression of aortic calcification in stage 5 ckd patients.
optimization of the antitumor activity of sequence-specific pyrrolobenzodiazepine derivatives based on their affinity for abc transporters fifty-eight cell lines in the national cancer institute drug screen were analyzed for their ability to efflux the fluorescent dye rhodamine 123 as a functional assay for p-glycoprotein (pgp). using flow cytometry, the rhodamine fluorescence was measured for each cell line under four incubation conditions, i.e., after accumulation in the presence or absence of the pgp antagonist cyclosporin a and after efflux in rhodamine-free medium in the presence or absence of cyclosporin a. the results in some cell lines were compatible with pgp-mediated efflux. there was a significant correlation between mdr-1 expression and rhodamine efflux in the 58 cell lines (r = 0.788, p = 0.0001). using the rhodamine efflux data as a seed for compare analysis with the cytotoxicity data on > 30,000 compounds in the national cancer institute drug screen database, hundreds of compounds with high correlation coefficients were identified. selected compounds were tested for reversal of cross-resistance in a multidrug-resistant cell line. a high degree of reversibility, up to 10,000-fold, for some of the compounds was noted in the presence of the pgp antagonist psc 833. this finding suggested that compounds with predominately pgp-mediated resistance were being identified. using these compounds as seeds for compare analysis against a more restricted database of 187 standard agents, a series of standard compounds were repeatedly identified as having high correlation coefficients with the newly identified pgp substrates. these standard agents, including phyllanthoside, bisantrene, and homoharringtonine, constitute an mdr-1 profile. new agents identified as being highly correlated with these compounds may benefit from clinical trials with pgp antagonists.
parental palliative cancer: psychosocial adjustment and health-related quality of life in adolescents participating in a german family counselling service clinicians observe that advanced cancer patients with dependent children agonize over the impact their death will have on their children. the objective of this study was to determine empirically whether advanced cancer patients with and without dependent children differ in treatment preferences, mental health, and end‐of‐life (eol) outcomes.
what exactly do students learn when they practice equation solving?: refining knowledge components with the additive factors model student modeling plays a critical role in developing and improving instruction and instructional technologies. we present a technique for automated improvement of student models that leverages the datashop repository, crowd sourcing, and a version of the learning factors analysis algorithm. we demonstrate this method on eleven educational technology data sets from intelligent tutors to games in a variety of domains from math to second language learning. in at least ten of the eleven cases, the method discovers improved models based on better test-set prediction in cross validation. the improvements isolate flaws in the original student models, and we show how focused investigation of flawed parts of models leads to new insights into the student learning process and suggests specific improvements for tutor design. we also discuss the great potential for future work that substitutes alternative statistical models of learning from the edm literature or alternative model search algorithms.
the in vivo dynamic fatigue response of the spine to sudden loading in the sagittal plane: effects of pre-load and step input magnitude. objective to evaluate the impact of muscle pre-activation levels and load magnitude on the response of the trunk to loading conditions causing rapid flexion.   design eight male subjects were asked to maintain an upright standing posture while resisting the application of forward flexion moments produced by four different loading conditions consisting of combinations of two pre-loads (4% or 16% of the maximum extensor moment) and two added loads (12% or 24%). pre-loading was used to develop different initial levels of trunk muscle activity prior to the application of the added loads. of special interest were the two conditions that resulted in total final loads of 28%.   background cocontraction of the antagonistic and agonistic muscles of the trunk are required to provide stability during normal physiological loading conditions. in several in vivo studies, levels of trunk muscle cocontraction have been observed prior to the application of unexpected or sudden loads. forces from the abdominal muscles have been proposed to provide stability when extensor moments are generated. the response of trunk muscles to rapid flexor moments would provide further insight into the dynamic stability mechanisms of the spine.   methods measurements were made of the trunk extensor moments, angular displacement of the trunk and unilateral surface emg amplitudes of three abdominal and three trunk extensor muscles. values were recorded during the isometric pre-load and for the maximum magnitude of each variable in response to the added load.   results higher pre-loads resulted in lower flexion rotations of the spine and higher added loads caused larger rotations. with increasing magnitudes of final loads, a corresponding increase in trunk extensor moments and trunk muscle cocontraction was observed. the largest activations were observed in the lumbar erector spinae and thoracic erector spinae muscles, while smaller yet substantial emg activity was observed in the internal oblique and external oblique. a comparison of the 28% loading conditions showed an increased response of the trunk to the [4 + 24] loading condition (with lower initial trunk stiffness) when compared to the [16 + 12] loading condition.   conclusions pre-activation of trunk extensor muscles can serve to reduce the flexion displacements caused by rapid loading. the abdominal oblique muscles, especially external oblique, will rapidly increase their activation levels in response to rapid loading. these changes are more pronounced when pre-activation levels are low, resulting in lower initial trunk stiffness and spine compression force. it is proposed that these factors will ultimately affect spine stability and the risk of injury.   relevance the results of this study provide insight into several mechanisms involved in the dynamic stability of the spine. injuries can be caused by unexpected and rapid loading of the spine. a study of the mechanisms available to respond to such perturbations is important to an understanding of spine mechanics and the etiology of low back injury.
gregarious sexual segregation: the unusual social organization of the malagasy narrow-striped mongoose (mungotictis decemlineata) the diversity of extant carnivores provides valuable opportunities for comparative research to illuminate general patterns of mammalian social evolution. recent field studies on mongooses (herpestidae), in particular, have generated detailed behavioural and demographic data allowing tests of assumptions and predictions of theories of social evolution. the first studies of the social systems of their closest relatives, the malagasy eupleridae, also have been initiated. the literature on mongooses was last reviewed over 25 years ago. in this review, we summarise the current state of knowledge on the social organisation, mating systems and social structure (especially competition and cooperation) of the two mongoose families. our second aim is to evaluate the contributions of these studies to a better understanding of mammalian social evolution in general. based on published reports or anecdotal information, we can classify 16 of the 34 species of herpestidae as solitary and nine as group‐living; there are insufficient data available for the remainder. there is a strong phylogenetic signal of sociality with permanent complex groups being limited to the genera crossarchus, helogale, liberiictis, mungos, and suricata. our review also indicates that studies of solitary and social mongooses have been conducted within different theoretical frameworks: whereas solitary species and transitions to gregariousness have been mainly investigated in relation to ecological determinants, the study of social patterns of highly social mongooses has instead been based on reproductive skew theory. in some group‐living species, group size and composition were found to determine reproductive competition and cooperative breeding through group augmentation. infanticide risk and inbreeding avoidance connect social organisation and social structure with reproductive tactics and life histories, but their specific impact on mongoose sociality is still difficult to evaluate. however, the level of reproductive skew in social mongooses is not only determined by the costs and benefits of suppressing each other's breeding attempts, but also influenced by resource abundance. thus, dispersal, as a consequence of eviction, is also linked to the costs of co‐breeding in the context of food competition. by linking these facts, we show that the socio‐ecological model and reproductive skew theory share some determinants of social patterns. we also conclude that due to their long bio‐geographical isolation and divergent selection pressures, future studies of the social systems of the eupleridae will be of great value for the elucidation of general patterns in carnivore social evolution.
hypercube network fault tolerance: a probabilistic approach introduces a new measure of conditional connectivity for large regular graphs by requiring each vertex to have at least g good neighbors in the graph. based on this requirement, the vertex connectivity for the n-dimensional cube is obtained, and the minimal sets of faulty nodes that disconnect the cube are characterized. >
retinoic acid enhances the production of il-10 while reducing the synthesis of il-12 and tnf-α from lps-stimulated monocytes/macrophages background measles kills about 2 million children annually, and there is no specific therapy for the disease. it has been suggested that vitamin a may be of benefit in the treatment of measles.   methods we conducted a randomized, double-blind trial involving 189 children who were hospitalized at a regional center in south africa because of measles complicated by pneumonia, diarrhea, or croup. the children (median age, 10 months) were assigned to receive either vitamin a (total dose, 400,000 iu of retinyl palmitate, given orally; n = 92) or placebo (n = 97), beginning within five days of the onset of the rash. at base line, the characteristics of the two groups were similar.   results although clinically apparent vitamin a deficiency is rare in this population, the children's serum retinol levels were markedly depressed (mean [+/- sem], 0.405 +/- 0.021 mumols per liter [11.6 +/- 0.6 micrograms per deciliter]), and 92 percent of them had hyporetinemia (serum retinol level less than 0.7 mumols per liter [20 micrograms per deciliter]). serum concentrations of retinol-binding protein (mean, 30.1 +/- 2.0 mg per liter) and albumin (mean, 33.4 +/- 0.5 g per liter) were also low. as compared with the placebo group, the children who received vitamin a recovered more rapidly from pneumonia (mean, 6.3 vs. 12.4 days, respectively; p less than 0.001) and diarrhea (mean, 5.6 vs. 8.5 days; p less than 0.001), had less croup (13 vs. 27 cases; p = 0.03), and spent fewer days in the hospital (mean, 10.6 vs. 14.8 days; p = 0.01). of the 12 children who died, 10 were among those given placebo (p = 0.05). for the group treated with vitamin a, the risk of death or a major complication during the hospital stay was half that of the control group (relative risk, 0.51; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.35 to 0.74).   conclusions treatment with vitamin a reduces morbidity and mortality in measles, and all children with severe measles should be given vitamin a supplements, whether or not they are thought to have a nutritional deficiency.
training-induced compensation versus magnification of individual differences in memory performance using a testing-the-limits paradigm, the authors investigated the modulation (attenuation) of negative adult age differences in imagery-based memory performance as a function of professional expertise. six older graphic designers, 6 normal older adults, 6 younger graphic design students, and 6 normal younger students participated in a 19-session program with a cued-recall variant of the method of loci. older graphic designers attained higher levels of mnemonic performance than normal older adults but were not able to reach younger adults' level of performance; a perfect separation of age groups was achieved. spatial visualization was a good predictor of mnemonic performance. results suggest that negative adult age differences in imagery-based memory are attenuated but not eliminated by the advantages associated with criterion-relevant ability (talent) and experience.
the evolutionarily dynamic ifn-inducible gtpase proteins play conserved immune functions in vertebrates and cephalochordates. ifn-γ orchestrates a potent antimicrobial host response. however, the underlying molecular basis for this immunological defense system is largely unknown. in a systematic approach to identify ifn-γ-regulated host effector molecules, a notable number of transcripts with consensus gtp-binding motives were obtained. further extensive transcriptome and genome analyses identified five novel family members of murine guanylate-binding proteins (mgbps) now designated mgbp6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. moreover, in this study, all 10 mgbp members (mgbp1–10) were extensively characterized. mgbps are selectively up-regulated in vitro by a set of proinflammatory cytokines and tlr agonists as well as in vivo after listeria monocytogenes and toxoplasma gondii infection. after ifn-γ stimulation, mgbp1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9 are associated with intracellular toxoplasma parasites and, interestingly, virulent toxoplasma interfere with mgbp recruitment. taken together, mgbps comprise an important set of host defense molecules.
clinicalarticle authors bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia some macrolides have been found to exert anti-inflammatory effects. lung diseases such as asthma, panbronchiolitis, cystic fibrosis, and bronchiectasis are thought to respond to the immunomodulatory properties of macrolides. we report three cases of idiopathic bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, now called cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, and three cases of radiation-related bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia that responded to macrolide therapy. an explanation of why macrolides may have anti-inflammatory effects in patients with these syndromes is discussed. these cases help to reinforce accumulating data that macrolides are beneficial as anti-inflammatory agents and organizing pneumonia may be another pulmonary disease that can benefit from such therapy.
competitive inter-species interactions underlie the increased antimicrobial tolerance in multispecies brewery biofilms significance microbes commonly form dense communities that are central to many diseases and bioremediation. here we demonstrate a simple and general principle of living in dense communities: microbes will commonly compete to reach nutrients at the community edge, akin to plants competing for light. we follow the evolution of a highly competitive genotype in colonies of a soil bacterium. we show that the genotype gains its advantage not from its intrinsic growth rate but by positioning itself at the surface of the community, where it gains preferential access to oxygen. a large-scale genetic analysis reveals striking parallel evolution and evidence of strong natural selection. our work suggests that positioning is a major basis for evolutionary competition in dense microbial communities. microbes commonly live in dense surface-attached communities where cells layer on top of one another such that only those at the edges have unimpeded access to limiting nutrients and space. theory predicts that this simple spatial effect, akin to plants competing for light in a forest, generates strong natural selection on microbial phenotypes. however, we require direct empirical tests of the importance of this spatial structuring. here we show that spontaneous mutants repeatedly arise, push their way to the surface, and dominate colonies of the bacterium pseudomonas fluorescens pf0-1. microscopy and modeling suggests that these mutants use secretions to expand and push themselves up to the growth surface to gain the best access to oxygen. physically mixing the cells in the colony, or introducing space limitations, largely removes the mutant’s advantage, showing a key link between fitness and the ability of the cells to position themselves in the colony. we next follow over 500 independent adaptation events and show that all occur through mutation of a single repressor of secretions, rsme, but that the mutants differ in competitiveness. this process allows us to map the genetic basis of their adaptation at high molecular resolution and we show how evolutionary competitiveness is explained by the specific effects of each mutation. by combining population level and molecular analyses, we demonstrate how living in dense microbial communities can generate strong natural selection to reach the growing edge.
impaired ifnγ-signaling and mycobacterial clearance in ifnγr1-deficient human ipsc-derived macrophages summary induced pluripotent stem cells (ipscs) represent an innovative source for the standardized in vitro generation of macrophages (mφ). we here describe a robust and efficient protocol to obtain mature and functional mφ from healthy as well as disease-specific murine ipscs. with regard to morphology, surface phenotype, and function, our ipsc-derived mφ (ipsc-mφ) closely resemble their counterparts generated in vitro from bone marrow cells. moreover, when we investigated the feasibility of our differentiation system to serve as a model for rare congenital diseases associated with mφ malfunction, we were able to faithfully recapitulate the pathognomonic defects in gm-csf signaling and mφ function present in hereditary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (herpap). thus, our studies may help to overcome the limitations placed on research into certain rare disease entities by the lack of an adequate supply of disease-specific primary cells, and may aid the development of novel therapeutic approaches for herpap patients.
inhibition of semliki forest virus penetration by lysosomotropic weak bases. semliki forest virus was mixed with liposomes containing phosphatidylcholine,phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin, and cholesterol. when the ph of the mixture was dropped to 6 or below, rapid fusion between the membranes of the virus and the liposomes occurred, resulting in the transfer of viral nucleocapsids into the liposomes. fusion was demonstrated biochemically by trapping rnase or trypsin within the liposomes. trapped rnase digested the viral rna into acid-soluble form, providing a simple quantitative assay for fusion. trapped trypsin digested the viral capsid protein. fusion was also demonstrated by electron microscopy as the formation of large vesicles containing viral glycoproteins on the surface and nucleocapsids inside. the efficiency of fusion was 91 +/- 6%. in addition to low ph, it required that the viral glycoproteins be intact. in the target liposomes, cholesterol (but none of the individual phospholipids) was essential. divalent cations were not required. our previous studies with tissue culture cells indicated that the final step in the penetration of the semliki forest virus genome into host cells might involve a fusion event between the membrane of lysosomally trapped viruses and the lysosomal membrane [helenius, a., kartenbeck, j., simons, k. & fries, e. (1980) j. cell biol, 84, 404--420]. the data presented here are fully compatible with this hypothesis.
suppression of in vivo rho-dependent transcription termination defects: evidence for kinetically controlled steps. nusg is a conserved regulatory protein that interacts with elongation complexes (ecs) of rna polymerase, dna, and rna to modulate transcription in multiple and sometimes opposite ways. in escherichia coli, nusg suppresses pausing and increases elongation rate, enhances termination by e. coli rho and phage hk022 nun protein, and promotes antitermination by lambdan and in ribosomal rna operons. we report nmr studies that suggest that e. coli nusg consists of two largely independent n- and c-terminal structural domains, ntd and ctd, respectively. based on tests of the functions of the ntd and ctd and variants of nusg in vivo and in vitro, we find that ntd alone is sufficient to suppress pausing and enhance transcript elongation in vitro. however, neither domain alone can enhance rho-dependent termination or support antitermination, indicating that interactions of both domains with ecs are required for these processes. we propose that the two domains of nusg mediate distinct interactions with ecs: the ntd interacts with rna polymerase and the ctd interacts with rho and other regulators, providing nusg with different combinations of interactions to effect different regulatory outcomes.
characterization of a recombinant amylolytic enzyme of hyperthermophilic archaeon thermofilum pendens with extremely thermostable maltogenic amylase activity shimizu et al. and ourselves have reported some enzymatic properties of an alpha-amylase from thermoactinomyces vulgaris r-47 that hydrolyzed pullulan to produce panose [m. shimizu et al., agric. biol. chem., 42, 1681-1688 (1978); y. sakano et al., agric. biol. chem., 46, 1121-1129 (1982)]. in this study, we cloned a gene for an alpha-amylase, which was different from the one mentioned above but also hydrolyzed pullulan to produce panose, from t. vulgaris r-47, and analyzed the entire primary structure of the gene. we designated the previously reported enzyme as t. vulgaris alpha-amylase i (tva i), and this novel enzyme as t. vulgaris alpha-amylase ii (tva ii). the nucleotide sequence had an open reading frame of 1755 base pairs corresponding to a protein of 585 amino acid residues. although this novel alpha-amylase, tva ii, hydrolyzed both pullulan and starch, the ratio of pullulan-hydrolyzing activity to starch-hydrolyzing activity of the enzyme was higher than that of tva i, and the primary structure of the enzyme resembled neopullulanase, which scarcely hydrolyzed starch, rather than that of tva i.
mechanical traction for mechanical neck disorders: a systematic review. a randomised clinical trial was conducted in the department of physical medicine, chittagong medical college hospital from july, 2001 to june, 2002. the objectives of the study were to find out the effects of cervical traction (ct) and exercise on the patients with chronic cervical spondylosis. a total of 199 patients with cervical spondylosis were included in the clinical trial. one hundred patients were treated with cervical traction plus exercise and 99 patients were treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid). posture correction advice was given to all patients. the patients were treated for 6 weeks. there was a marked improvement in both the groups after treatment (p<0.001). but there was nearly significant difference regarding improvement in treatment with ct plus exercise than with nsaid (p = 0.06). the results indicate that the improvement of the patients with chronic cervical spondylosis was more in ct plus exercise than analgesics. so, ct & neck muscle strengthening exercise may have some more beneficial effects than nsaids on chronic cervical spondylosis.
the reach and limits of the us president's emergency plan for aids relief (pepfar) funding of prevention of mother-to-child transmission (pmtct) of hiv in nigeria. objective:to measure changes in service utilization of a model integrating family planning with hiv counselling and testing (hct), antiretroviral therapy (art) and prevention of mother-to-child transmission (pmtct) in the nigerian public health facilities. design:it is a retrospective survey of attendance and family planning commodity uptake in 71 health facilities in nigeria that analyzes the preintegration and postintegration periods between march 2007 and january 2009. methods:a prepost retrospective comparison of mean attendance at family planning clinics and couple-years of protection (cyp) compared 6 months preintegration with 9 months postintegration period. an analysis of service ratios was conducted, relating completed referrals at family planning clinics to service utilization at the referring hiv clinics. results:mean attendance at family planning clinics increased significantly from 67.6 in preintegration to 87.0 in postintegration. the mean cyp increased significantly from 32.3 preintegration to 38.2 postintegration. service ratio of referrals from each of the hiv clinics was low but increased in the postintegration period by 4, 34 and 42 per 1000 clients from hct, art and pmtct clinics, respectively. service ratios were higher in primary healthcare settings than in secondary or tertiary hospitals. attendance by men at family planning clinics was significantly higher among clients referred from hiv clinics. conclusion:family planning–hiv integration using the referral model improved family planning service utilization by clients accessing hiv services, but further improvement is possible. male utilization of family planning services also improved. the government of nigeria should review the family planning user fee policy and scale up the integration in primary healthcare facilities.
the balance of serum matrix metalloproteinase-8 and its tissue inhibitor in acute coronary syndrome and its recurrence. objective the imbalance between matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) 1, 3, and 9 and their specific inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (timp-1), is a critical step in cartilage injury and angiogenesis in arthritis. to explore the therapeutic potential of timp-1 gene transfer in erosive arthritis, the effects of an adenoviral vector (ad-timp-1) were assessed in dba/1 mice with collagen-induced arthritis (cia).   methods dba/1 mice with cia received an intravenous injection of replication-deficient adenovirus containing the human timp-1 gene or a control lacz gene on day 28 postimmunization. the efficiency of gene transfer was determined by serum timp-1 detection, measurements of paw swelling, as well as radiologic and histologic examination of the paws.   results a single administration of ad-timp-1 resulted in detectable serum levels of the exogenous protein for at least 13 days. the incidence and onset of arthritis were not statistically modified after human timp-1 gene transfer in dba/1 mice compared with control mice. however, the severity of inflammation was statistically significantly increased in ad-timp-1-treated mice and a similar trend was observed in the histologic and radiologic scores. with regard to the mechanisms of the worsened effect in the ad-timp-1-treated mice, we observed 1) higher serum levels of anti-type ii collagen igg2a, 2) a significant increase in endogenous soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor i (tnfri) in sera, and 3) increased labeling of mouse tumor necrosis factor alpha and tnfri within arthritic joints.   conclusion these findings show that overexpression of timp-1 does not prevent osteochondral injury in a mouse model of arthritis. since mmps have overlapping properties in terms of their roles in extracellular matrix degradation, angiogenesis, and shedding of cell surface adhesion molecules, cytokines, and cytokine receptors, the paradoxical results obtained suggest that timp-1 is probably not the main inhibitor to target.
a biological function for the neuronal activity-dependent component of bdnf transcription in the development of cortical inhibition creb is a transcription factor implicated in the control of adaptive neuronal responses. although one function of creb in neurons is believed to be the regulation of genes whose products control synaptic function, the targets of creb that mediate synaptic function have not yet been identified. this report describes experiments demonstrating that creb or a closely related protein mediates ca2+-dependent regulation of bdnf, a neurotrophin that modulates synaptic activity. in cortical neurons, ca2+ influx triggers phosphorylation of creb, which by binding to a critical ca2+ response element (cre) within the bdnf gene activates bdnf transcription. mutation of the bdnf cre or an adjacent novel regulatory element as well as a blockade of creb function resulted in a dramatic loss of bdnf transcription. these findings suggest that a creb family member acts cooperatively with an additional transcription factor(s) to regulate bdnf transcription. we conclude that the bdnf gene is a creb family target whose protein product functions at synapses to control adaptive neuronal responses.
range-wide analysis of wildlife habitat: implications for conservation it is generally perceived that biodiversity is better protected from human activities after an area is designated as a protected area. however, we found that this common perception was not true in wolong nature reserve (southwestern china), which was established in 1975 as a “flagship” protected area for the world-renowned endangered giant pandas. analyses of remote sensing data from pre- and post-establishment periods indicate that the reserve has become more fragmented and less suitable for giant panda habitation. the rate of loss of high-quality habitat after the reserve's establishment was much higher than before the reserve was created, and the fragmentation of high-quality habitat became far more severe. after the creation of the reserve, rates of habitat loss and fragmentation inside the reserve unexpectedly increased to levels that were similar to or higher than those outside the reserve, in contrast to the situation before the reserve was created.
identification of genes expressed differentially in subcutaneous and visceral fat of cattle, pig, and mouse. matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) are essential for proper extracellular matrix remodeling, a process that takes place during obesity-mediated adipose tissue formation. here, we examine expression profiles and the potential role of mmps and their tissue inhibitors (timps) in adipose tissue remodeling during obesity. expression patterns are studied by northern blot and real-time pcr in two genetic models of obesity (ob/ob and db/db mice) and in a diet-induced model of obesity (akr mice). of the mmps and timps studied, mrna levels for mmp-2, mmp-3, mmp-12, mmp-14, mmp-19, and timp-1 are strongly induced in obese adipose tissues compared with lean tissues. in contrast, mmp-7 and timp-3 mrnas are markedly decreased in obesity. interestingly, enzymatic activities of mmp-12 and of a new identified adipocyte-derived 30-kda metalloproteinase are enhanced in obese adipose tissue fractions, demonstrating that mmp/timp balance is shifted toward increased matrix degradation in obesity. finally, we analyze the modulation of mmp-2, mmp-19, and timp-1 during 3t3-l1 preadipocyte differentiation, and we explore the effect of inhibition of mmp activity on in vitro adipogenesis. we find that the synthetic mmp inhibitor bb-94 (batimastat) decreases adipose conversion of 3t3-l1 and primary rat preadipocytes. bb-94 represses differentiation without affecting mitotic clonal expansion but prevents the early expression of ccaat/enhancer-binding protein β, a transcription factor that is thought to play a major role in the adipogenic program. such findings support a role for the mmp/timp system in the control of proteolytic events and adipogenesis during obesity-mediated fat mass development.
a genome-wide survey of hd-zip genes in rice and analysis of drought-responsive family members hahb-4 is a member of the helianthusannuus (sunflower) subfamily i of hd-zip proteins that is transcriptionally regulated by water availability and abscisic acid. transgenic arabidopsis thaliana plants overexpressing this transcription factor (tf) exhibit a characteristic phenotype that includes a strong tolerance to water stress. here we show that this tf is a new component of ethylene signalling pathways, and that it induces a marked delay in senescence. plants overexpressing hahb-4 are less sensitive to external ethylene, enter the senescence pathway later and do not show the typical triple response. furthermore, transgenic plants expressing this gene under the control of its own inducible promoter showed an inverse correlation between ethylene sensitivity and hahb-4 levels. potential targets of hahb-4 were identified by comparing the transcriptome of hahb-4-transformed and wild-type plants using microarrays and quantitative rt-pcr. expression of this tf has a major repressive effect on genes related to ethylene synthesis, such as aco and sam, and on genes related to ethylene signalling, such as erf2 and erf5. expression studies in sunflower indicate that hahb-4 transcript levels are elevated in mature/senescent leaves. expression of hahb-4 is induced by ethylene, concomitantly with several genes homologous to the targets identified in the transcriptome analysis (ha-acoa and ha-acob). transient transformation of sunflower leaves demonstrated the action of hahb-4 in the regulation of ethylene-related genes. we propose that hahb-4 is involved in a novel conserved mechanism related to ethylene-mediated senescence that functions to improve desiccation tolerance.
alternative interventions to prevent oxidative damage following ischemia/reperfusion oxidative stress is considered a major contributor to etiology of both “normal” senescence and severe pathologies with serious public health implications. mitochondria generate reactive oxygen species (ros) that are thought to augment intracellular oxidative stress. mitochondria possess at least nine known sites that are capable of generating superoxide anion, a progenitor ros. mitochondria also possess numerous ros defense systems that are much less studied. studies of the last three decades shed light on many important mechanistic details of mitochondrial ros production, but the bigger picture remains obscure. this review summarizes the current knowledge about major components involved in mitochondrial ros metabolism and factors that regulate ros generation and removal. an integrative, systemic approach is applied to analysis of mitochondrial ros metabolism, which is now dissected into mitochondrial ros production, mitochondrial ros removal, and mitochondrial ros emission. it is suggested that mitochondria augment intracellular oxidative stress due primarily to failure of their ros removal systems, whereas the role of mitochondrial ros emission is yet to be determined and a net increase in mitochondrial ros production in situ remains to be demonstrated.
understanding e-book continuance intention: empirical evidence from e-book users in a developing country this paper examines cognitive beliefs and affect influencing one's intention to continue using (continuance) information systems (is). expectation-confirmation theory is adapted from the consumer behavior literature and integrated with theoretical and empirical findings from prior is usage research to theorize a model of is continuance. five research hypotheses derived from this model are empirically validated using a field survey of online banking users. the results suggest that users' continuance intention is determined by their satisfaction with is use and perceived usefulness of continued is use. user satisfaction, in turn, is influenced by their confirmation of expectation from prior is use and perceived usefulness. post-acceptance perceived usefulness is influenced by users' confirmation level. this study draws attention to the substantive differences between acceptance and continuance behaviors, theorizes and validates one of the earliest theoretical models of is continuance, integrates confirmation and user satisfaction constructs within our current understanding of is use, conceptualizes and creates an initial scale for measuring is continuance, and offers an initial explanation for the acceptance-discontinuance anomaly.
observed versus predicted outcome for decompressive craniectomy: a population-based study. objectivedevelop and validate a predictive model of the incidence of long-term disability following traumatic brain injury (tbi) and obtain national estimates for the united states in 2003. data/methodsa logistic regression model was built, using a population-based sample of persons with tbi from the south carolina traumatic brain injury follow-up registry. the regression coefficients were applied to the 2003 healthcare cost and utilization project–nationwide inpatient sample data to estimate the incidence of long-term disability following traumatic brain injury hospitalization. resultsamong 288,009 (95% ci, 287,974–288,043) hospitalized tbi survivors in the united states in 2003, an estimated 124,626 (95% ci, 123,706–125,546) had developed long-term disability. conclusiontbi-related disability is a significant public health problem in the united states. the substantial incidence suggests the need for comprehensive rehabilitative care and services to maximize the potential of persons with tbi.
clinical and institutional interventions and children’s resilience and recovery from sexual abuse a recent surgeon general's report and various studies document racial and ethnic disparities in mental health care, including gaps in access, questionable diagnostic practices, and limited provision of optimum treatments. bias is a little studied but viable explanation for these disparities. it is important to isolate bias from other barriers to high-quality mental health care and to understand bias at several levels (practitioner, practice network or program, and community). more research is needed that directly evaluates the contribution of particular forms of bias to disparities in the area of mental health care.
post-translational regulation of rotavirus protein nsp1 expression in mammalian cells ns53 (nsp1), the gene 5 product of the group a rotaviruses, is a minor nonstructural protein of 486 to 495 amino acids which binds zinc and contains an amino-terminal highly conserved cysteine-rich region that may form one or two zinc fingers. to study the structure-function of the gene 5 product, wild-type and mutant forms of ns53 were produced by using a recombinant baculovirus expression system and a recombinant vaccinia virus/t7 (vtf7-3) expression system. analysis of the rna-binding activity of the wild-type ns53 immobilized onto protein a-sepharose beads with ns53-specific antiserum showed that the protein exhibited specific affinity for all 11 rotavirus mrnas. the use of short virus-specific rna probes indicated that ns53 specifically recognizes an element located near the 5' ends of viral mrnas. analysis of the rna-binding activity of deletion mutants of ns53 showed that the rna-binding domain resides within the first 81 amino acids of the protein and that the highly conserved cysteine-rich region within this region of the protein is essential for the activity. gel electrophoresis and western immunoblot analyses of intracellular fractions derived from infected cells revealed that large amounts of ns53 were present in the cytosol and in association with the cytoskeletal matrix. indirect immunofluorescence analysis of cells programmed to transiently express mutant forms of ns53 using vtf7-3 indicated that the intracellular localization domain resides between amino acids 84 and 176 of ns53. together, these data show that the rna-binding domain and the intracellular localization domain lie upstream from the region of ns53 previously determined not to be essential for replication of rotaviruses in cell culture (j. hua and j. t. patton, virology 198:567-576, 1994).
role of connexin43 and atp in long-range bystander radiation damage and oncogenesis in vivo to gain a greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying the cellular responses to low-dose ionizing radiation, gene expression profiles were examined by microarray analysis of cdna from confluent human diploid fibroblast cultures exposed to very low fluences of alpha-particles. the data, supported by northern and western analyses, indicate that radiation induces a significant up-regulation of connexin43 expression. this phenomenon was observed in a variety of irradiated cell types. these findings are consistent with our previous observations that connexin43 (cx43)-mediated gap-junction intercellular communication is involved in the bystander response observed in cell cultures exposed to fluences of alpha-particles by which only a very small fraction of the cell nuclei is traversed by a particle track (e. i. azzam et al., proc. natl. acad. sci. usa, 98: 473-478, 2001). increased mrna levels in cells from irradiated cultures correlated with increased cx43 protein levels by approximately 4 h after irradiation. the induction of cx43 was observed by mean alpha-particle doses as low as 0.16 cgy, and also in cells exposed to gamma-rays, t-butyl hydroperoxide, and hyperthermia. exposure to these stresses also resulted in post-translational modification of cx43; increased phosphorylation and hyperphosphorylation of the protein was observed. up-regulation of cx43 expression in ionizing radiation exposed cells correlated with functional communication through gap junctions, as evidenced by dye transfer from irradiated to nonirradiated cells. in contrast, the response after uv radiation varied and was cell type-dependent. overall, these data suggest a critical role for genes involved in intercellular communication in mediating the cellular responses to a variety of stresses.
neighborhood context and immigrant children's physical activity. context research examining the association between environmental attributes and physical activity among youth is growing. an updated review of literature is needed to summarize the current evidence base, and to inform policies and environmental interventions to promote active lifestyles among young people.   evidence acquisition a literature search was conducted using the active living research (alr) literature database, an online database that codes study characteristics and results of published papers on built/social environment and physical activity/obesity/sedentary behavior. papers in the alr database were identified through pubmed, web of science, and sportdiscus using systematically developed and expert-validated search protocols. for the current review, additional inclusion criteria were used to select observational, quantitative studies among youth aged 3-18 years.   evidence synthesis papers were categorized by design features, sample characteristics, and measurement mode. relevant results were summarized, stratified by age (children or adolescents) and mode of measurement (objective or perceived) for environmental attributes and physical activity. percentage of significant results was calculated.   conclusions mode of measurement greatly influenced the consistency of associations between environmental attributes and youth physical activity. for both children and adolescents, the most consistent associations involved objectively measured environmental attributes and reported physical activity. the most supported correlates for children were walkability, traffic speed/volume, access/proximity to recreation facilities, land-use mix, and residential density. the most supported correlates for adolescents were land-use mix and residential density. these findings support several recommendations for policy and environmental change from such groups as the iom and national physical activity plan.
retinal gene therapy despite their physiological roles, müller glial cells are involved directly or indirectly in retinal disease pathogenesis and are an interesting target for therapeutic approaches for retinal diseases and regeneration such as crb1 inherited retinal dystrophies. in this study, we characterized the efficiency of adeno-associated virus (aav) capsid variants and different promoters to drive protein expression in müller glial cells. shh10y and aav9 were the most powerful capsids to infect mouse müller glial cells. retinaldehyde-binding protein 1 (rlbp1) promoter was the most powerful promoter to transduce müller glial cells. shh10y capsids and rlbp1 promoter targeted human müller glial cells in vitro. we also developed and tested smaller promoters to express the large crb1 gene via aav vectors. minimal cytomegalovirus (cmv) promoter allowed expression of full-length crb1 protein in müller glial cells. in summary, shh10y and aav9 capsids, and rlbp1 or minimal cmv promoters are of interest as specific tools to target and express in mouse or human müller glial cells.
automatic generation of test inputs for mercury we introduce mercury, a new purely declarative logic programming language designed to provide the support that groups of application programmers need when building large programs. mercury's strong type, mode, and determinism systems improve program reliability by catching many errors at compile time. we present a new and relatively simple execution model that takes advantage of the information these systems provide, yielding very efficient code. the mercury compiler uses this execution model to generate portable c code. our benchmarking shows that the code generated by our implementation is significantly faster than the code generated by mature optimizing implementations of other logic programming languages.
sources of seasonal fractional integration in macroeconomic time series a simple construction that will be referred to as an error-duration model is shown to generate fractional integration and long memory. an error-duration representation also exists for many familiar arma models, making error duration an alternative to autoregression for explaining dynamic persistence in economic variables. the results lead to a straightforward procedure for simulating fractional integration and establish a connection between fractional integration and common notions of structural change. two examples show how the error-duration model could account for fractional integration in aggregate employment and in asset price volatility.
successful nonsurgical treatment of pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, pneumoperitoneum, pneumoretroperitoneum, and subcutaneous emphysema following ercp endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp)-related perforation occurs in 0.1-1.8% of patients after therapeutic ercp. it is a serious complication with a high mortality. however, little evidence exists in the medical literature and the optimal management remains unclear. this review aims to critically evaluate the optimal management of therapeutic ercp-related perforation.
connexin 43 mediates endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor-induced vasodilatation in subcutaneous resistance arteries from healthy pregnant women. the objective of the present study was to investigate human omental arteries and veins with respect to: (i) the contractile effect of the thromboxane a2 analogue u46619, (ii) endothelium‐dependency and mediators of the relaxing effect of substance p (sp) and acetylcholine (ach). changes in isometric tension in response to administration of u46619, sp and ach were measured in human isolated omental arteries and veins with and without endothelium. to investigate the mechanism of action of sp, the sp‐induced relaxation was measured in the presence of indomethacin (cyclo‐oxygenase inhibitor), ng‐monomethyl‐l‐arginine (l‐nmma, nitric oxide‐synthase inhibitor), kcl (inhibitor of endothelium‐dependent hyperpolarization), tetraethylammonium (tea; non‐selective inhibitor of k+‐channels, with some preference for the high conductance ca2+‐activated k+‐channel, bkca), glibenclamide (inhibitor of the atp‐sensitive k+‐channel) and/or clotrimazole (inhibitor of the cytochrome p450‐system and the intermediate conductance ca2+‐activated k+‐channel, ikca). u46619 contracted both the artery and the vein segments. endothelium removal did not alter the contraction. ach caused neither contraction nor relaxation in artery and vein segments precontracted with u46619. in both artery and vein segments precontracted with u46619, sp produced endothelium‐dependent relaxation. the relaxation was unaffected by indomethacin, but was incompletely reduced by l‐nmma and kcl respectively. the l‐nmma‐resistent relaxation was abolished in the presence of kcl. tea inhibited the sp‐induced relaxation in artery and vein segments both in the presence and absence of l‐nmma and indomethacin, while glibenclamide and clotrimazole had no effect. in conclusion, the sp‐induced relaxation in human omental arteries and veins seems to be mediated via no and endothelium‐dependent hyperpolarization. katp and ikca are probably not involved in the hyperpolarization, but activation of bkca may contribute to the hyperpolarization. prostanoid synthesis and the cytochrome p450‐system are probably not involved in the sp‐induced relaxation in this area.
coding and non-coding variants in the shox2 gene in patients with early-onset atrial fibrillation atrial fibrillation (af) is the most common arrhythmia and is associated with increased morbidity. as the population ages and the prevalence of af continues to rise, the socioeconomic consequences of af will become increasingly burdensome. although there are well-defined clinical risk factors for af, a significant heritable component is also recognized. to identify the molecular basis for the heritability of af, investigators have used a combination of classical mendelian genetics, candidate gene screening, and genome-wide association studies. however, these avenues have, as yet, failed to define the majority of the heritability of af. the goal of this review is to describe the results from both candidate gene and genome-wide studies, as well as to outline potential future avenues for creating a more complete understanding of af genetics. ultimately, a more comprehensive view of the genetic underpinnings for af will lead to the identification of novel molecular pathways and improved risk prediction of this complex arrhythmia.
seasonality in iranian fruit and vegetable dietary intake objective to study the change of intake of nutrients in a year, and determine whether there is any change of intake of nutrition according to different seasons of the people in both northern and southern china.   methods the method of 24-hour diet history recall was used to study about 300 healthy adults in three areas, a rural area in the northern and rural plus urban areas in the southern. the study was carried out once per two month, and each time last 3 days. based on the amount of food intake, the amount of both nutrition and energy per person and per day was calculated.   results the amount of energy, protein, carbohydrate, fat intake of the residents in three areas was adequate. there was almost no significant difference of intake of energy and three major nutrients (protein, fat and carbohydrate) both in the southern and northern part of china among different seasons, as well as the seasonal intake of thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin e, niacin, and zinc. while the difference of intake of retinol (microg re), ascorbic acid, potassium and calcium were significant among different seasons.   conclusion this study showed that, in rural areas, any dietary survey should avoid january and july, which is either slack or busy season for farmers. in urban areas, any time of a year should not influence the results of a dietary survey.
oxidative stress in mouse liver caused by dietary amino acid deprivation: protective effect of methionine two-dimensional non-equilibrium ph gel electrophoresis (2d-nephge) analysis was used to evaluate the effects of dietary protein depletion on the protein composition of mouse liver cytosol. analysing the cytosol from both normal and protein depleted liver, the position in gels of more than three hundred protein spots was determined. after 5 days of protein depletion, about 20% of the spots either increased or decreased more than 2 fold. five spots of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) were recognised by specific antibodies. the glutathione s-transferase (gsts) subunits yb1, yc and yf were identified by the simultaneous analysis of both glutathione-binding cytosolic proteins and the corresponding standards. as estimated by internal optical density (iod) of spots, the changes caused by protein depletion in gapdh and gst subunit contents were similar to those obtained by other methods. by means of mass spectrometric analysis of tryptic peptides generated from spots and/or comparison of two-dimensional gel electrophoretic patterns, carbonic anhydrase iii (caiii), cu, zn superoxide dismutase (cuznsod) and a cytochrome p450 cytosolic protein (cyt p450) were identified. these three proteins, as well as gsts, are related with intracellular detoxification and free radical scavenging systems. their contents were regulated by dietary protein restriction in a manner indicative of diminished liver defence against oxidising agents.
agonists of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha induce a fiber-type-selective transcriptional response in rat skeletal muscle. lovastatin (ls) is a potent hmg-coa inhibitor used in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. in humans it can cause a severe, necrotizing myopathy with myoglobinuria and renal failure. to investigate the pathogenesis of ls-induced myopathy we studied the effects of ls on rat skeletal muscle. lewis rats were gavage-fed 1 mg/g body weight/day of ls. control rats received carboxymethylcellulosc-based suspension by gavage. gastrocnemius and soleus, fast and slow twitch muscles respectively, were studied by light and electron microscopy. by day 10 ls-treated rats became severely weak. gastrocnemius was severely affected with degeneration of membranous organelles and microvacuole formation, but soleus was spared. eventually, 20–50% of the gastrocnemius but none of the soleus fibers became necrotic. non-necrotic fibers showed no increases of acid phosphatase, indicating that autophagy was not excited. we conclude that ls causes muscle injury by inducing degeneration of membranous organelles, and fast twitch muscle fibers are selectively vulnerable to ls myopathy.
eicosapentaenoic acid prevents atrial fibrillation associated with heart failure in a rabbit model. eicosapentaenoic acid (epa) has been reported to have beneficial effects on the progression of various renal diseases including diabetic nephropathy; however, the precise mechanisms are not completely understood. we examined the effects of epa on the early stage of type 2 diabetic nephropathy in kka(y)/ta mice and the possible role of inflammation, oxidative stress, and growth factor in this process. kka(y)/ta mice were divided into 2 groups. the treatment group was injected with epa ethyl ester at 1 g/kg per day intraperitoneally from 12 to 20 weeks of age and the control group was injected with saline. renal morphologic examinations were performed after 8 weeks of treatment. glomerular macrophage infiltration and expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, malondialdehyde (mda), nitrotyrosine, transforming growth factor beta1 (tgf-beta1), and type i collagen were evaluated. eicosapentaenoic acid decreased the levels of urinary albumin, serum triglyceride and mda, and improved glucose intolerance in kka(y)/ta mice. morphometric analysis showed that accumulation of extracellular matrix and the tubulointerstitial fibrosis area were significantly decreased after treatment. immunohistochemistry revealed that glomerular macrophage infiltration and the expression of mda and nitrotyrosine in kka(y)/ta mice were increased and were inhibited by epa treatment. protein and gene expression levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, tgf-beta1, and type i collagen, which were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, were down-regulated in the epa treatment group. in conclusion, epa improves type 2 diabetic nephropathy in kka(y)/ta mice. this beneficial effect might be mediated by attenuation of metabolic abnormalities and inhibition of renal inflammation, oxidative stress, and tgf-beta expression.
atp released from cardiac fibroblasts via connexin hemichannels activates profibrotic p2y2 receptors we have developed a method for measuring the local concentration of atp at the extracellular surface of live cells. this method relies on the specific attachment to the cell surface of a chimeric protein that consists of the igg-binding domain of staphylococcus aureus protein a fused in-frame with the complete sequence for firefly luciferase (proa-luc). expression of proa-luc in escherichia coli and its one-step affinity purification are straightforward. attachment to cells is demonstrated to be specific and antibody dependent using several suspended and adherent cell types. light production by cell surface-attached luciferase is continuous, linearly related to atp concentration, and sufficient to provide nanomolar sensitivity. the spatial resolution of this method enables the observation of strictly local changes in extracellular atp during its secretion from activated platelets. furthermore, the activity of cell-attached luciferase is relatively refractory to the inclusion of nucleotidases in the medium, arguing for its effectiveness in cell systems possessing potent ecto-atpases.
broad phonetic class recognition in a hidden markov model framework using extended baum-welch transformations in this paper, we present a noise robust landmark detection and segmentation algorithm using a sinusoidal model representation of speech. we compare the performance of our approach under noisy conditions against two segmentation methods used in the summit segment-based speech recognizer, a full segmentation approach and an approach that detects segment boundaries based on spectral change. the word error rate of the spectral change segmentation method degrades rapidly in the presence of noise, while the sinusoidal and full segmentation models degrade more gracefully. however, the full segmentation method requires the largest computation time of the three approaches. we find that our new algorithm provides the best tradeoff between word accuracy and computation time of the three methods. furthermore, we find that our model is robust when speech is contaminated by various noise types
geneseer: a sage for gene names and genomic resources ensembl (http://www.ensembl.org/) is a bioinformatics project to organize biological information around the sequences of large genomes. it is a comprehensive source of stable automatic annotation of individual genomes, and of the synteny and orthology relationships between them. it is also a framework for integration of any biological data that can be mapped onto features derived from the genomic sequence. ensembl is available as an interactive web site, a set of flat files, and as a complete, portable open source software system for handling genomes. all data are provided without restriction, and code is freely available. ensembl's aims are to continue to "widen" this biological integration to include other model organisms relevant to understanding human biology as they become available; to "deepen" this integration to provide an ever more seamless linkage between equivalent components in different species; and to provide further classification of functional elements in the genome that have been previously elusive.
clinical and pathologic features of h-type bovine spongiform encephalopathy associated with e211k prion protein polymorphism bovine spongiform encephalopathy (bse) is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy of cattle, first detected in 1986 in the united kingdom and subsequently in other countries. it is the most likely cause of variant creutzfeldt-jakob disease (vcjd) in humans, but the origin of bse has not been elucidated so far. this report describes the identification and characterization of two cases of bse diagnosed in the united states. case 1 (december 2003) exhibited spongiform changes in the obex area of the brainstem and the presence of the abnormal form of the prion protein, prpsc, in the same brain area, by immunohistochemistry (ihc) and western blot analysis. initial suspect diagnosis of bse for case 2 (november 2004) was made by a rapid elisa-based bse test. case 2 did not exhibit unambiguous spongiform changes in the obex area, but prpsc was detected by ihc and enrichment western blot analysis in the obex. using western blot analysis, prpsc from case 1 showed molecular features similar to typical bse isolates, whereas prpsc from case 2 revealed an unusual molecular prpsc pattern: molecular mass of the unglycosylated and monoglycosylated isoform was higher than that of typical bse isolates and case 2 was strongly labeled with antibody p4, which is consistent with a higher molecular mass. sequencing of the prion protein gene of both bse-positive animals revealed that the sequences of both animals were within the range of the prion protein gene sequence diversity previously reported for cattle.
the fibronectin synergy site re-enforces cell adhesion and mediates a crosstalk between integrin classes fibrin(ogen) deficiency (fg-/-) was shown previously to be compatible with rapid thrombus growth within injured arterioles, but platelet fibronectin content was increased and newly formed thrombi were unstable. to further define the role of fibrin(ogen) in thrombus formation and stabilization, platelet biology was examined in mice expressing a form of fibrinogen that clots normally but lacks the gamma chain c-terminal binding site for alpha iib beta 3 (fg gamma delta 5). thrombus growth within the arterioles of fg gamma delta 5 mice appeared faster than in wild-type mice despite a far greater emboli formation. unlike fg-/- mice, the emboli were relatively small and released from the top of thrombi, rather than by fracture at the vessel wall. the fibronectin content in fg gamma delta 5 platelets was also dramatically increased through a beta 3 integrin-dependent mechanism. the following has been concluded: (1) fibrin formation contributes to, but is not sufficient for, the stabilization of arterial thrombi. platelet receptor engagement of the c-terminal of the fg gamma chain contributes to the stable incorporation of platelets into thrombi. (2) alternative ligands to fibrinogen can support efficient thrombus growth. (3) fibrinogen is internalized through alpha iib beta 3 engagement of the fibrinogen gamma chain element, and this interaction secondarily controls the fibronectin content of platelets.
preferential spectral image quality model memory for object color often produces object-specific deviations from actual color. several studies have indicated that “memory colors” exist and in some cases influence perception of object color. systematic changes in memory for color per se cannot account for these memorycolor phenomena. a study was conducted to characterize more specifically the nature of memory for object color information. the study was designed to assess the dependence of memory color on shape and texture information, to compare memory color with color preference, and to determine whether sophistication about color technology affects color memory and preference. results indicated that, for hue and brightness, memory and preference were quite accurate for the objects tested; however, all subjects remembered and also preferred all items to be more highly saturated. change in context produced no change in accuracy, suggesting that access to memory for object color is independent of shape and texture information. color seems to be an independently accessible feature of memory representation rather than an integral part of a prototypic representation.
multiple infection sources identification with provable guarantees assume a network (v,e) where a subset of the nodes in v are active. we consider the problem of selecting a set of k active nodes that best explain the observed activation state, under a given information-propagation model. we call these nodes effectors. we formally define the k-effectors problem and study its complexity for different types of graphs. we show that for arbitrary graphs the problem is not only np-hard to solve optimally, but also np-hard to approximate. we also show that, for some special cases, the problem can be solved optimally in polynomial time using a dynamic-programming algorithm. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to consider the k-effectors problem in networks. we experimentally evaluate our algorithms using the dblp co-authorship graph, where we search for effectors of topics that appear in research papers.
gene duplications in prokaryotes can be associated with environmental adaptation abstract fuel oxygenates such as methyl and ethyl tert-butyl ether (mtbe and etbe, respectively) are degraded only by a limited number of bacterial strains. the aerobic pathway is generally thought to run via tert-butyl alcohol (tba) and 2-hydroxyisobutyrate (2-hiba), whereas further steps are unclear. we have now demonstrated for the newly isolated β-proteobacterial strains l108 and l10, as well as for the closely related strain cip i-2052, that 2-hiba was degraded by a cobalamin-dependent enzymatic step. in these strains, growth on substrates containing the tert-butyl moiety, such as mtbe, tba, and 2-hiba, was strictly dependent on cobalt, which could be replaced by cobalamin. tandem mass spectrometry identified a 2-hiba-induced protein with high similarity to a peptide whose gene sequence was found in the finished genome of the mtbe-degrading strain methylibium petroleiphilum pm1. alignment analysis identified it as the small subunit of isobutyryl-coenzyme a (coa) mutase (icm; ec 5.4.99.13), which is a cobalamin-containing carbon skeleton-rearranging enzyme, originally described only in streptomyces spp. sequencing of the genes of both icm subunits from strain l108 revealed nearly 100% identity with the corresponding peptide sequences from m. petroleiphilum pm1, suggesting a horizontal gene transfer event to have occurred between these strains. enzyme activity was demonstrated in crude extracts of induced cells of strains l108 and l10, transforming 2-hiba into 3-hydroxybutyrate in the presence of coa and atp. the physiological and evolutionary aspects of this novel pathway involved in mtbe and etbe metabolism are discussed.
seasonal separation of african savanna components using worldview-2 imagery: a comparison of pixel- and object-based approaches and selected classification algorithms this paper describes the use of probabilistic graphical models, in particular bayesian networks (bn), for the detection of two problem invasive alien plants, c. odorata and l. camara, from the recently-launched 8-band worldview-2 satellite imagery acquired on 26 september 2010 over central swaziland. the main objective of this work was to apply and evaluate the efficacy of the very high resolution multispectral satellite imagery for invasive alien plant detection using bn models. the posterior probabilities (parameters) were estimated using the expectationmaximization (em) algorithms. a comparison of the results obtained from the models indicates excellent classification accuracies above 95%, and kappa coefficient values above 0.90. the highest classification accuracies of 99% were obtained when using the newer bands. the main result obtained in this study is that the new worldview-2 bands are effective for alien invasive species detection. the bn approach considered here provide relatively similar and accurate solutions for the classification of the multispectral image although the l. camara model was marginally competitive relative to the c. odorata model when measured in terms of the brier score and the logarithmic loss. the results point to the potential usefulness and applicability of the additional bands from the worldview-2 satellite for very high resolution plant species detection and monitoring.
a new authentication mechanism and key agreement protocol for sip using identity-based cryptography this memorandum describes rtp, the real-time transport protocol. rtp provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services. rtp does not address resource reservation and does not guarantee quality-of-service for real-time services. the data transport is augmented by a control protocol (rtcp) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality. rtp and rtcp are designed to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers. the protocol supports the use of rtp-level translators and mixers.
titan cell production in cryptococcus neoformans reshapes the cell wall and capsule composition during infection the pathogenesis of cryptococcus neoformans infection has been studied extensively with respect to inflammatory and pathological changes, but very little information is available regarding the morphology of yeast cells during the course of infection. electron microscopy of cryptococcus neoformans in murine pulmonary infection revealed increased cell wall thickness with time, but this difference was only partially accounted for by increases in cell diameter. cell walls of melanized cells were thicker than those of nonmelanized cells 2 h after infection, and the cell wall of yeast became blacker with time, suggesting that melanization contributes to the increased cell wall thickness. heterogeneous cell populations emerged, with the appearance of giant forms. while for c. neoformans atcc strain 24067 (serotype d) the full spectrum of cell sizes were observed, for strains h99 (serotype a) and 3501 (serotype d) cells were divisible into two populations, giant and micro forms. in contrast to cellular heterogeneity, the epitope recognized by a protective mab on the capsular glucuronoxylomannan (gxm) was found at all times of infection. immunoelectron microscopy using mabs to gxm demonstrated reactivity with intracellular structures, suggesting that synthesis of capsular polysaccharide occurs, at least in part, in the cytoplasm. in summary, the results indicate that: (i) the infection is dynamic with respect to yeast cell morphology; (ii) giant cell forms arise in tissue during the course of infection; (iii) cell walls blacken and thicken during the course of infection, consistent with melanin synthesis during infection; and (iv) gxm epitopes are found in the capsule, cell wall and cytoplasm, consistent with intracellular polysaccharide synthesis. the results indicate that the population of c. neoformans cells in tissue is in a highly dynamic state, implying that the immune system must confront cells with varying characteristics during the course of infection.
on how solution populations can guide revision of model parameters this paper describes a successful application of evolutionary computation to a difficult and commercially significant constrained optimization problem. the financial product model, for optimizing mortgage refinancing packages, is introduced. it is a realistic, and very challenging optimization problem, for which standard solvers leave much to be desired. an untuned two-population genetic algorithm (ga) has been remarkably successful in finding good, feasible and nearly optimal solutions. in addition, the genetic solver provides important information for management decision making besides simply a good solution to the model. finally, the paper undertakes a case study in order to investigate the details of how and why the two-population ga works.
the bar domain proteins: molding membranes in fission, fusion, and phagy ubiquitination of integral plasma membrane proteins triggers their rapid internalization into the endocytic pathway. the yeast ubiquitin ligase rsp5p, a homologue of mammalian nedd4 and itch, is required for the ubiquitination and subsequent internalization of multiple plasma membrane proteins, including the α-factor receptor (ste2p). here we demonstrate that rsp5p plays multiple roles at the internalization step of endocytosis. temperature-sensitive rsp5 mutant cells were defective in the internalization of α-factor by a ste2p-ubiquitin chimera, a receptor that does not require post-translational ubiquitination. similarly, a modified version of ste2p bearing a npfxd linear peptide sequence as its only internalization signal was not internalized in rsp5 cells. internalization of these variant receptors was dependent on the catalytic cysteine residue of rsp5p and on ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes that bind rsp5p. thus, a rsp5p-dependent ubiquitination event is required for internalization mediated by ubiquitin-dependent and -independent endocytosis signals. constitutive ste2p-ubiquitin internalization and fluid-phase endocytosis also required active ubiquitination machinery, including rsp5p. these observations indicate that rsp5p-dependent ubiquitination of a trans-acting protein component of the endocytosis machinery is required for the internalization step of endocytosis.
sequence and gene content of a large fragment of a lizard sex chromosome and evaluation of candidate sex differentiating gene r-spondin 1 an individual's sex depends upon its genes (genotypic sex determination or gsd) in birds and mammals, but reptiles are more complex: some species have gsd whereas in others, nest temperatures determine offspring sex (temperature-dependent sex determination). previous studies suggested that montane scincid lizards (bassiana duperreyi, scincidae) possess both of these systems simultaneously: offspring sex is determined by heteromorphic sex chromosomes (xx–xy system) in most natural nests, but sex ratio shifts suggest that temperatures override chromosomal sex in cool nests to generate phenotypically male offspring even from xx eggs. we now provide direct evidence that incubation temperatures can sex-reverse genotypically female offspring, using a dna sex marker. application of exogenous hormone to eggs also can sex-reverse offspring (oestradiol application produces xy as well as xx females). in conjunction with recent work on a distantly related lizard taxon, our study challenges the notion of a fundamental dichotomy between genetic and thermally determined sex determination, and hence the validity of current classification schemes for sex-determining systems in reptiles.
interest rate uncertainty , hedging , and real activity ∗ we examine investment behavior when firms face costs in the access to external funds. we find that despite the existence of liquidity constraints, standard investment regressions predict that cash flow is an important determinant of investment only if one ignores q. conversely, we also obtain significant cash flow effects even in the absence of financial frictions. these findings provide support to the argument that the success of cash flow augmented investment regressions is probably due to a combination of measurement error in q and identification problems.
recombinant protein containing b-cell epitopes of different loxosceles spider toxins generates neutralizing antibodies in immunized rabbits loxoscelism is a necrotic-hemolytic syndrome caused by bites of brown spiders belonging to the genus loxosceles. many approaches for the treatment of loxosceles poisoning have already been proposed, among which administration of specific antivenom is thought to be the more specific. we have evaluated the use of peptides as immunogen to raise in rabbits an antibody response that could protect animals from a challenge by the loxtox isoform lid1, one of the main toxic component of loxosceles intermedia venom. six antigenic regions of lid1 were mapped by using the spot method. the corresponding peptides were further chemically synthesized, mixed, and used as immunogens in rabbits. control animal received recombinant lid1 alone or together with peptides. we found that the rabbit antibody response to peptides was cross-reactive with lid1, although only one peptide from the mix of six was immunogenic. the dermonecrotic, hemorrhagic and oedema forming activities induced by lid1 in naïve rabbits were inhibited by 82%, 35% and 35% respectively, by preincubation of lid1 with anti-peptide antibodies prepared from immunized rabbits. animals that were immunized with peptides or lid1r, were found to be protected from the dermonecrotic, hemorrhagic and oedema forming activities induced by a challenge with lid1. the protection conferred by peptides was, however, lower than that provided by the peptide protein combination or by the full-length protein. these results encourage us in the utilization of synthetic peptides for therapeutic serum development or vaccination approaches.
nevus comedonicus: a case series abstract: we report extensive nevus comedonicus in a female patient that involved half of her body entirely, with infected cystic lesions as well as typical scars, limited by the midline. the lesions worsened at the beginning of puberty. a brief review of the literature highlights the histopathologic, etiopathogenic, and therapeutic aspects.
harmonia axyridis (coleoptera: coccinellidae) in asia: a re-examination of the native range and invasion to southeastern kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan harmonia axyridis (pallas, 1773) (coleoptera: coccinellidae) is a ladybird beetle native to temperate and subtropical parts of asia. since 1916 populations of this species have been introduced throughout the world, either deliberately, or by accident through international transport. harmonia axyridis was originally released as a classical biological control agent of aphid and coccid pests in orchards and forests, but since 1994 it is also available as a commercial product for augmentative control in field and greenhouse crops. it is a very voracious and effective natural enemy of aphids, psyllids and coccids in various agricultural and horticultural habitats and forests. during the past 20 years, however, it has successfully invaded non-target habitats in north america (since 1988), europe (1999) and south america (2001) respectively in a short period of time, attacking a wide range of non-pest species in different insect orders. becoming part of the agricultural commercial pathway, it is prone to being introduced into large areas across the world by accident. we use the climex programme (v2) to predict the potential geographical distribution of h. axyridis by means of matching the climate of its region of origin with other regions in the world and taking in account biological characteristics of the species. establishment and spread seem likely in many regions across the world, including those areas which h. axyridis has already invaded (temperate europe, north america). based on the climex prediction a large part of mediterranean europe, south america, africa, australia and new zealand seem highly suitable for long-term survival of h. axyridis as well. in addition we evaluate climex as a strategic tool for estimating establishment potential as part of an environmental risk assessment procedure for biological control agents we discuss biological and ecological aspects necessary to fine-tune its establishment and spread in areas after it has been introduced.
kernel conditional exponential family in this paper, we consider an infinite dimensional exponential family, $\mathcal{p}$ of probability densities, which are parametrized by functions in a reproducing kernel hilbert space, $h$ and show it to be quite rich in the sense that a broad class of densities on $\mathbb{r}^d$ can be approximated arbitrarily well in kullback-leibler (kl) divergence by elements in $\mathcal{p}$. the main goal of the paper is to estimate an unknown density, $p_0$ through an element in $\mathcal{p}$. standard techniques like maximum likelihood estimation (mle) or pseudo mle (based on the method of sieves), which are based on minimizing the kl divergence between $p_0$ and $\mathcal{p}$, do not yield practically useful estimators because of their inability to efficiently handle the log-partition function. instead, we propose an estimator, $\hat{p}_n$ based on minimizing the \emph{fisher divergence}, $j(p_0\vert p)$ between $p_0$ and $p\in \mathcal{p}$, which involves solving a simple finite-dimensional linear system. when $p_0\in\mathcal{p}$, we show that the proposed estimator is consistent, and provide a convergence rate of $n^{-\min\left\{\frac{2}{3},\frac{2\beta+1}{2\beta+2}\right\}}$ in fisher divergence under the smoothness assumption that $\log p_0\in\mathcal{r}(c^\beta)$ for some $\beta\ge 0$, where $c$ is a certain hilbert-schmidt operator on $h$ and $\mathcal{r}(c^\beta)$ denotes the image of $c^\beta$. we also investigate the misspecified case of $p_0\notin\mathcal{p}$ and show that $j(p_0\vert\hat{p}_n)\rightarrow \inf_{p\in\mathcal{p}}j(p_0\vert p)$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$, and provide a rate for this convergence under a similar smoothness condition as above. through numerical simulations we demonstrate that the proposed estimator outperforms the non-parametric kernel density estimator, and that the advantage with the proposed estimator grows as $d$ increases.
hardware implementation of adder for pulse signal processing ultra low power wearable wireless patient monitoring systems will be critical for continuous remote monitoring of patients and fast transmission of data to medical personnel for timely intervention. this paper proposes a pulse based methodology for photoplethysmogram (ppg) feature discrimination using the time-based integrate and fire (if) sampler for continuous, portable pulse oximetry. the analog ppg is transformed into a sequence of time events where the time between two events represents a constant area under the analog ppg signal, with injective mapping between the two domains. a simple and robust method is formulated that directly estimates the systolic peak time from the output of the if sampler. the proposed processing method can be implemented in hardware using simple combinatorial logic and is comparable to performance of existing digital signal processing methods in the literature.
rip3 knockdown rescues photoreceptor cell death in blind pde6c zebrafish rod and cone photoreceptor neurons utilize discrete pde6 enzymes that are crucial for phototransduction. rod pde6 is composed of heterodimeric catalytic subunits (αβ), while the catalytic core of cone pde6 (α′) is a homodimer. it is not known if variations between pde6 subunits preclude rod pde6 catalytic subunits from coupling to the cone phototransduction pathway. to study this issue, we generated a cone-dominated mouse model lacking cone pde6 (nrl−/− cpfl1). in this animal model, using several independent experimental approaches, we demonstrated the expression of rod pde6 (αβ) and the absence of cone pde6 (α′) catalytic subunits. the rod pde6 enzyme expressed in cone cells is active and contributes to the hydrolysis of cgmp in response to light. in addition, rod pde6 expressed in cone cells couples to the light signaling pathway to produce s-cone responses. however, s-cone responses and light-dependent cgmp hydrolysis were eliminated when the β-subunit of rod pde6 was removed (nrl−/− cpfl1 rd). we conclude that either rod or cone pde6 can effectively couple to the cone phototransduction pathway to mediate visual signaling. interestingly, we also found that functional pde6 is required for trafficking of m-opsin to cone outer segments.
copd symptom burden: impact on health care resource utilization, and work and activity impairment to study the impact of self-administration of nonprescription medicines (npms) on patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), in chongqing municipality, china. a total of 85 patients who had used npm were assigned to the npm group. another 83 patients who had only used prescription medicines (pms) were assigned to the pm group. their income, educational levels, health status, public health insurance coverage, the expense of drugs during exacerbation, and the numbers of acute exacerbations during the past year were surveyed, and the approved drugs for copd were evaluated. the contents of corticosterone in various types of npms were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. the proportion of use of npm in hospitalized patients with copd was 12.96%. the percentage of illiteracy and low income was significantly higher in copd patients in the npm group than those in the pm group. the cost of drugs per day and the quality of life in the npm group were lower than those in the pm group. further analysis revealed that 15 of 21 npms contained corticosteroids. more importantly, medical advice from doctors and nurses appeared to be effective. some chinese patients with copd living in the chongqing area of china used npms that contained corticosteroids. health education and advisement can effectively limit the use of npms.
use of health information technology to advance evidence-based care: lessons from the va queri program objectives to document and assess the experiences of 104 agency for healthcare research and quality (ahrq)-funded health information technology (health it) grantees in planning and implementing health it systems.   data source grant proposals and interviews with the ahrq health it grantees.   data collection method extracted descriptive data from the health it grant proposals; conducted telephone interviews with principal investigators.   principal findings ahrq funding of the health it projects provided important support for health it development work in various health care settings. successful implementation required commitment from top management, dedicated staff and financial resources, an open process to encourage buy-in and enthusiasm by end users, and sheer persistence. technologies required tailoring to the specific organization's needs. grantees felt their projects could be replicated by others, if organizations had ample it expertise and resources. evaluating the value of health it was hampered by the absence of validated instruments and measures, organizational demands that competed with data collection, and lack of evaluation expertise among health it implementers.   conclusions experiences of the health it grantees provide rich information for use by health care providers, ahrq, and other policy makers to help strengthen future health it development efforts, including the need to improve evaluation design and standards to assess impact.
a mitochondria-anchored isoform of the actin-nucleating spire protein regulates mitochondrial division masterminding mitochondrial fission mitochondria are highly dynamic and undergo fusion and fission and they move in cells. defects in mitochondrial dynamics are implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases. recent findings have suggested that mitochondrial fission occurs preferentially at endoplasmic reticulum (er) contact sites, with er circumscribing mitochondria and possibly promoting the constriction of mitochondria during fission. korobova et al. (p. 464) now suggest that an er-localized formin, inf2, is required for mitochondrial fission and that inf2-mediated actin polymerization facilitates mitochondrial constriction. actin filaments between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria promote mitochondrial fission. mitochondrial fission is fundamentally important to cellular physiology. the dynamin-related protein drp1 mediates fission, and interaction between mitochondrion and endoplasmic reticulum (er) enhances fission. however, the mechanism for drp1 recruitment to mitochondria is unclear, although previous results implicate actin involvement. here, we found that actin polymerization through er-localized inverted formin 2 (inf2) was required for efficient mitochondrial fission in mammalian cells. inf2 functioned upstream of drp1. actin filaments appeared to accumulate between mitochondria and inf2-enriched er membranes at constriction sites. thus, inf2-induced actin filaments may drive initial mitochondrial constriction, which allows drp1-driven secondary constriction. because inf2 mutations can lead to charcot-marie-tooth disease, our results provide a potential cellular mechanism for this disease state.
a new conservative-dynamic treatment for the acute ruptured achilles tendon background there is a lack of consensus regarding the best option for the treatment of acute achilles tendon rupture. treatment can be broadly classified as operative (open or percutaneous) or nonoperative (casting or functional bracing). postoperative splinting can be performed with a rigid cast (proximal or distal to the knee) or a more mobile functional brace. the aim of this meta-analysis was to identify and summarize the evidence from randomized, controlled trials on the effectiveness of different interventions for the treatment of acute achilles tendon ruptures.   methods we searched multiple databases (including embase, cinahl, and medline) as well as reference lists of articles and contacted authors. keywords included achilles tendon, rupture, and tendon injuries. three reviewers extracted data and independently assessed trial quality with use of a ten-item scale.   results twelve trials involving 800 patients were included. there was a variable level of methodological rigor and reporting of outcomes. open operative treatment was associated with a lower risk of rerupture compared with nonoperative treatment (relative risk, 0.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.11 to 0.64). however, it was associated with a higher risk of other complications, including infection, adhesions, and disturbed skin sensibility (relative risk, 10.60; 95% confidence interval, 4.82 to 23.28). percutaneous repair was associated with a lower complication rate compared with open operative repair (relative risk, 2.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.06 to 7.62). patients who had been managed with a functional brace postoperatively (allowing for early mobilization) had a lower complication rate compared with those who had been managed with a cast (relative risk, 1.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.27 to 2.76). because of the small number of patients involved, no definitive conclusions could be made regarding different nonoperative treatment regimens.   conclusions open operative treatment of acute achilles tendon ruptures significantly reduces the risk of rerupture compared with nonoperative treatment, but operative treatment is associated with a significantly higher risk of other complications. operative risks may be reduced by performing surgery percutaneously. postoperative splinting with use of a functional brace reduces the overall complication rate.   level of evidence therapeutic level i.
applicability of a segmental bioelectrical impedance analysis for predicting the whole body skeletal muscle volume. this study aimed to investigate the validity of using segmental bioelectrical impedance (bi) analysis for estimating skeletal muscle volume (mv) in the trunk, defined as the body segment from the acromion process to the greater trochanter. using a magnetic resonance imaging (mri) method, the trunk mv was determined in 28 men (19 approximately 34 yr), divided into validation (n = 20) and cross-validation (n = 8) groups, and used as a reference (mv(mri)). for bi measurements of the trunk, the source electrodes were placed at the dorsal surface of the third metacarpal bone of both hands and the dorsal surface of the third metatarsal bone of both feet, and the detector electrodes were placed at the acromion process of both shoulders and the greater trochanter of both femurs. using this arrangement, the bi values of five parts of the trunk, both sides of the upper region, the middle region, and both sides of the lower region, were obtained and then used to calculate the whole trunk bi value and bi index (bi index(tr)). in the validation group, a simple regression analysis of the relationship between bi index(tr) and mv(mri) showed a significant correlation between the two variables (r = 0.884, p < 0.05) and produced a prediction equation with a se of estimation of 1,020.3 cm3 (8.5%). in the validation and cross-validation groups, there were no significant differences between the measured and estimated mv without systematic errors. these findings indicate that the segmental bi analysis employed in the present study can be used to estimate trunk mv.
kidins220/ arms association with nav channels protein kinase d (pkd) is a serine/threonine kinase regulated by diacylglycerol signaling pathways with unique domain composition and enzymatic properties, still awaiting identification of its specific substrate(s). here we have isolated, cloned, and characterized a novel protein from pc12 cells, termed kidins220 (kinase d-interactingsubstrate of 220 kda), as the first identified pkd physiological substrate. kidins220 contains 11 ankyrin repeats and four transmembrane domains within the n-terminal region. we have shown that kidins220 is an integral membrane protein selectively expressed in brain and neuroendocrine cells, where it concentrates at the tip of neurites. in pc12 cells, pkd co-immunoprecipitates and phosphorylates endogenous kidins220. this phosphorylation is increased after stimulating pkd activity in vivo by phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate treatment. a constitutively active pkd mutant (pkd-s744e/s748e) phosphorylates recombinant kindins220-vsvgin vitro in the absence of phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate. conversely, kidins220-vsvg phosphorylation is abolished when a dominant negative mutant of pkd (pkd-d733a) is used. moreover, a peptide within the kidins220 sequence, containing serine 919 in a consensus motif for pkd-specific phosphorylation, behaved as the best peptide substrate to date. substitution of serine 919 to alanine abrogated peptide phosphorylation. furthermore, by generating an antibody recognizing kidins220 phosphorylated on serine 919, we show that phorbol ester treatment causes the specific phosphorylation of this residue in pc12 cells in vivo. our results provide the first physiological substrate for pkd and indicate that kidins220 is phosphorylated by pkd at serine 919 in vivo.
kernel descriptors for visual recognition a key ingredient in the design of visual object classification systems is the identification of relevant class specific aspects while being robust to intra-class variations. while this is a necessity in order to generalize beyond a given set of training images, it is also a very difficult problem due to the high variability of visual appearance within each class. in the last years substantial performance gains on challenging benchmark datasets have been reported in the literature. this progress can be attributed to two developments: the design of highly discriminative and robust image features and the combination of multiple complementary features based on different aspects such as shape, color or texture. in this paper we study several models that aim at learning the correct weighting of different features from training data. these include multiple kernel learning as well as simple baseline methods. furthermore we derive ensemble methods inspired by boosting which are easily extendable to several multiclass setting. all methods are thoroughly evaluated on object classification datasets using a multitude of feature descriptors. the key results are that even very simple baseline methods, that are orders of magnitude faster than learning techniques are highly competitive with multiple kernel learning. furthermore the boosting type methods are found to produce consistently better results in all experiments. we provide insight of when combination methods can be expected to work and how the benefit of complementary features can be exploited most efficiently.
availability knob: flexible user-defined availability in the cloud businesses and academics are increasingly turning to infrastructure as a service (iaas) clouds such as amazon's elastic compute cloud (ec2) to fulfill their computing needs. unfortunately, current iaas systems provide a severely restricted pallet of rentable computing options which do not optimally fit the workloads that they are executing. we address this challenge by proposing and evaluating a manycore architecture, called the sharing architecture, specifically optimized for iaas systems by being reconfigurable on a sub-core basis. the sharing architecture enables better matching of workload to micro-architecture resources by replacing static cores with virtual cores which can be dynamically reconfigured to have different numbers of alus and amount of cache. this reconfigurability enables many of the same benefits of heterogeneous multicores, but in a homogeneous fabric, and enables the reuse and resale of resources on a per alu or per kb of cache basis. the sharing architecture leverages distributed ilp techniques, but is designed in a way to be independent of recompilation. in addition, we introduce an economic model which is enabled by the sharing architecture and show how different users who have varying needs can be better served by such a flexible architecture. we evaluate the sharing architecture across a benchmark suite of apache, specint, and parts of parsec, and find that it can achieve up to a 5x more economically efficient market when compared to static architecture multicores. we implemented the sharing architecture in verilog and present area overhead results.
contextual statistics of space-time ordered features for human action recognition local image features or interest points provide compact and abstract representations of patterns in an image. in this paper, we extend the notion of spatial interest points into the spatio-temporal domain and show how the resulting features often reflect interesting events that can be used for a compact representation of video data as well as for interpretation of spatio-temporal events.to detect spatio-temporal events, we build on the idea of the harris and förstner interest point operators and detect local structures in space-time where the image values have significant local variations in both space and time. we estimate the spatio-temporal extents of the detected events by maximizing a normalized spatio-temporal laplacian operator over spatial and temporal scales. to represent the detected events, we then compute local, spatio-temporal, scale-invariant n-jets and classify each event with respect to its jet descriptor. for the problem of human motion analysis, we illustrate how a video representation in terms of local space-time features allows for detection of walking people in scenes with occlusions and dynamic cluttered backgrounds.
towards a framework of digital platform competition: a comparative study of monopolistic & federated mobile payment platforms i this essay, we argue that pervasive digitization gives birth to a new type of product architecture: the layered modular architecture. the layered modular architecture extends the modular architecture of physical products by incorporating four loosely coupled layers of devices, networks, services, and contents created by digital technology. we posit that this new architecture instigates profound changes in the ways that firms organize for innovation in the future. we develop (1) a conceptual framework to describe the emerging organizing logic of digital innovation and (2) an information systems research agenda for digital strategy and the creation and management of corporate information technology infrastructures.
differential diagnosis of mesiotemporal lesions: case report of neurosyphilis a spectrum of infectious diseases may affect the cranial meninges. contrast-enhanced mr imaging and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery mr techniques are superior to contrast-enhanced computed tomography for detecting and characterizing most pathologic meningeal conditions. in patients with meningitis, a major role of medical imaging is to identify potential complications such as hydrocephalus, extra-axial mass-forming infectious collections, parenchymal infarcts related to arteritis, ventriculitis, and associated underlying parenchymal abscesses or granuloma formations. early diagnosis of such complications may reduce the rate of morbidity and mortality in this group of patients.
the effect of hydro-alcoholic celery (apiumgraveolens) leaf extract on cardiovascular parameters and lipid profile in animal model of hypertension induced by fructose to determine whether insulin resistance is responsible for the development of hypertension, we examined whether blood pressure changes in an insulin-resistant animal that was given a fructose solution as their drinking water. wistar kyoto rats that drank a 10% fructose solution for 10 weeks showed significant increases not only in plasma triglyceride and insulin levels but also in systolic blood pressure. the decrease in blood glucose in response to the intraperitoneal injection of insulin (0.2-1.0 u/kg) was slight in these fructose-drinking rats. to confirm whether insulin resistance contributes to the observed hypertension, we examined the effect of pioglitazone, an insulin sensitizer, on blood pressure in rats given a 10% fructose solution. when pioglitazone was administered to the rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks from 12 weeks of age, plasma triglyceride and insulin levels and systolic blood pressure decreased, and blood glucose reduction in response to insulin was normalized. these results suggest that insulin resistance is responsible for the development of hypertension in fructose-drinking rats.
alternative interventions to prevent oxidative damage following ischemia/reperfusion oxidative stress is considered a major contributor to etiology of both “normal” senescence and severe pathologies with serious public health implications. mitochondria generate reactive oxygen species (ros) that are thought to augment intracellular oxidative stress. mitochondria possess at least nine known sites that are capable of generating superoxide anion, a progenitor ros. mitochondria also possess numerous ros defense systems that are much less studied. studies of the last three decades shed light on many important mechanistic details of mitochondrial ros production, but the bigger picture remains obscure. this review summarizes the current knowledge about major components involved in mitochondrial ros metabolism and factors that regulate ros generation and removal. an integrative, systemic approach is applied to analysis of mitochondrial ros metabolism, which is now dissected into mitochondrial ros production, mitochondrial ros removal, and mitochondrial ros emission. it is suggested that mitochondria augment intracellular oxidative stress due primarily to failure of their ros removal systems, whereas the role of mitochondrial ros emission is yet to be determined and a net increase in mitochondrial ros production in situ remains to be demonstrated.
baseline study to determine in vitro activities of daptomycin against gram-positive pathogens isolated in the united states in 2000-2001 daptomycin mics were determined for 844 gram-positive bacteria in three concentrations of ca(++) and compared with the mics of vancomycin and teicoplanin. daptomycin was twofold to fourfold more active against most species when tested in 50 microg/ml of ca(++) than in 25 microg/ml. in 50 microg/ml of ca(++) daptomycin was more active against methicillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci than teicoplanin or vancomycin; 100% of these isolates were susceptible to < or =2.0 microg/ml of daptomycin. different lots of mueller-hinton agar were variable in ca(++) content, and daptomycin disk diffusion zone diameters were affected, i.e., zones were 1 to 15 mm smaller on one lot of agar with only 6 microg/ml of ca(++) compared to another lot with 28 microg/ml. the previously proposed daptomycin interpretive breakpoints performed satisfactorily when mics were determined in mueller-hinton broth with 50 microg/ml of ca(++) and when the agar gave appropriate zones with quality control strains. to define those control limits, replicate tests with four quality control strains were performed in ten laboratories using broth microdilution tests (with ca(++) supplemented broth) and disk diffusion tests on mueller-hinton agar without cation adjustments.
effects of acrylamide on the nervous tissue antioxidant system and sciatic nerve electrophysiology in the rat the effect of monomeric acrylamide, a potent neurotoxic agent, on total and neuron specific enolase activity was studied in vitro and in vivo. acrylamide (10 mm) completely inhibited total enolase activity of rat brain soluble fractions. the i50 concentration was 3.7 mm. in rats chronically treated with acrylamide (550 mg/kg total) and exhibiting marked symptoms of neurotoxicity, neuron specific enolase activity was not detectable in sciatic nerves and was only 60% of control activity in brain. total enolase activity in both central and peripheral nervous tissues was unchanged from control. the results suggest that inhibition of neuron specific enolase may be an important factor in the development of acrylamide neuropathy by interfering with glycolysis in neuronal tissue.
intradural prostate carcinoma metastatic lesion mimicking an exophytic ependymoma: case report the management of 10 patients with symptomatic localized intradural extramedullary spinal metastasis is reviewed. the single most common primary source was carcinoma of the breast (four cases). the initial symptom in nine patients was pain, with five patients reporting a characteristically severe cramping discomfort with radicular distribution. all patients underwent laminectomy decompression. at the time of surgery, six of the patients were weak but ambulatory and four were bedridden. following surgery, four patients enjoyed some measure of pain relief, seven patients became ambulatory, and three remained bedridden. two patients achieved a "satisfactory" result, and were walking and continent 6 months after surgery. secondary brain tumors were demonstrated or implicated in nine patients, supporting the concept that the spinal metastases represented tertiary deposits following dissemination via the cerebrospinal fluid. symptomatic intradural extramedullary spinal metastasis causes a virulent clinical syndrome with poor prognosis and disappointing outcome after treatment. given the high incidence of associated cerebral metastatic involvement, total neuraxis radiation and/or chemotherapy should be considered when symptomatic spinal metastasis is discovered to be intradural and extramedullary.
losing control: excessive alcohol seeking after selective inactivation of cue-responsive neurons in the infralimbic cortex antisense c-fos oligonucleotides injected into the neostriatum of conscious rats selectively inhibited c-fos expression associated with compensatory increases in striatal c-fos mrna levels and also with increased expression of junb and ngfi-a mrna, probably as a result of regulatory phenomena. dual probe in vivo microdialysis was used to investigate gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba) release in the substantia nigra and the globus pallidus, which represent the terminal sites of the dopamine d1 receptor regulated striatonigral and the dopamine d2 receptor regulated striatopallidal gaba pathways, respectively. intrastriatal infusion of the c-fos antisense oligonucleotide profoundly decreased dialysate gaba levels in the ipsilateral substantia nigra within 60 min but did not influence the dialysate gaba levels in the globus pallidus compared with the sham and control oligonucleotide treated groups. the site of action of the antisense oligonucleotides was mainly restricted to striatal neurons as shown by the distribution of locally injected fluoresceine isothiocyanate and radiolabeled oligonucleotides. the findings demonstrate a facilitatory role for c-fos mediated gene regulation in striatonigral gaba transmission and strengthen the evidence that the regulation of neurotransmission is different in the striatonigral and striatopallidal gaba pathways.
effect of glucose on xylose utilization in saccharomyces cerevisiae harboring the xylose reductase gene the increased concern for the security of the oil supply and the negative impact of fossil fuels on the environment, particularly greenhouse gas emissions, has put pressure on society to find renewable fuel alternatives. the most common renewable fuel today is ethanol produced from sugar or grain (starch); however, this raw material base will not be sufficient. consequently, future large-scale use of ethanol will most certainly have to be based on production from lignocellulosic materials. this review gives an overview of the new technologies required and the advances achieved in recent years to bring lignocellulosic ethanol towards industrial production. one of the major challenges is to optimize the integration of process engineering, fermentation technology, enzyme engineering and metabolic engineering.
reactive sc : speculatively relaxing memory consistency model contraints using dynamic classification of cache blocks sequential consistency (sc) is arguably the most intuitive behavior for a shared-memory multithreaded program. it is widely accepted that language-level sc could significantly improve programmability of a multiprocessor system. however, efficiently supporting end-to-end sc remains a challenge as it requires that both compiler and hardware optimizations preserve sc semantics. while a recent study has shown that a compiler can preserve sc semantics for a small performance cost, an efficient and complexity-effective sc hardware remains elusive. past hardware solutions relied on aggressive speculation techniques, which has not yet been realized in a practical implementation. this paper exploits the observation that hardware need not enforce any memory model constraints on accesses to thread-local and shared read-only locations. a processor can easily determine a large fraction of these safe accesses with assistance from static compiler analysis and the hardware memory management unit. we discuss a low-complexity hardware design that exploits this information to reduce the overhead in ensuring sc. our design employs an additional unordered store buffer for fast-tracking thread-local stores and allowing later memory accesses to proceed without a memory ordering related stall. our experimental study shows that the cost of guaranteeing end-to-end sc is only 6.2% on average when compared to a system with tso hardware executing a stock compiler's output.
targeted degradation of pseudo-response regulator5 by an scfztl complex regulates clock function and photomorphogenesis in arabidopsis thaliana[w] in arabidopsis thaliana, the transcripts of the aprr1/toc1 family genes each start accumulating after dawn rhythmically and one after another at intervals in the order of aprr9-->aprr7-->aprr5-->aprr3-->aprr1/toc1 under continuous light. except for the well-characterized aprr1/toc1, however, no evidence has been provided that other aprr1/toc1 family genes are indeed implicated in the mechanisms underlying circadian rhythms. we here attempted to provide such evidence by characterizing transgenic plants that constitutively express the aprr5 gene. the resulting aprr5-overexpressing (aprr5-ox) plants showed intriguing properties with regard to not only circadian rhythms, but also control of flowering time and light response. first, the aberrant expression of aprr5 in such transgenic plants resulted in a characteristic phenotype with regard to transcriptional events, in which free-running rhythms were considerably altered for certain circadian-regulated genes, including cca1, lhy, aprr1/toc1, other aprr1/toc1 members, gi and cab2, although each rhythm was clearly sustained even after plants were transferred to continuous light. with regard to biological events, aprr5-ox plants flowered much earlier than wild-type plants, more or less, in a manner independent of photoperiodicity (or under short-day conditions). furthermore, aprr5-ox plants showed an srl (short-hypocotyls under red light) phenotype that is indicative of hypersensitiveness to red light in early photomorphogenesis. both aprr1-ox and aprr9-ox plants also showed the same phenotype. therefore, aprr5 (together with aprr1/toc1 and aprr9) must be taken into consideration for a better understanding of the molecular links between circadian rhythms, control of flowering time through the photoperiodic long-day pathway, and also light signaling-controlled plant development.
expression of foreign type i ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/ oxygenase (ec 4.1.1.39) stimulates photosynthesis in cyanobacterium synechococcus pcc7942 cells changes in gas-exchange rates during the life span of the leaves of rice (oryza sativa l.) were analyzed quantitatively by measuring changes in the carboxylation/oxygenation and regeneration of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (rubp) at photon fluence rates of 2000 (saturating) and 500 (subsaturating) μmol quanta·m-2·s-1 under ambient air conditions. the rubp levels were always higher than the active-site concentrations of rubp carboxylase (ec 4.1.1.39), irrespective of the irradiance supplied. analysis of the co2-assimilation rate as a function of intercellular co2 concentration indicated that rubp regeneration does not limit co2 assimilation. the estimated rubp-carboxylase/oxygenase activity in vivo was linearly correlated to the rate of co2 assimilation at each level of irradiance. this enzyme activity was just enough to account for the rate of co2 assimilation at the saturating irradiance and was 35% more than the rate of co2 assimilation at the subsaturating irradiance. analysis of the assimilation rate at subsaturating irradiance as a function of intercellular co2 concentration indicated that a limitation caused by enzyme activation comes into play. the results indicate that the rate of co2 assimilation in rice leaves under ambient air conditions is limited during their entire life span by the rubp-carboxylation/oxygenation capacity.
effect of homocysteine on the histological structure of femur in young male albino rats and the possible protective role of folic acid purpose incidence of hip fractures among elderly patients with parkinson's disease is high. recent studies have found that levodopa induces hyperhomocysteinemia in parkinson's disease. hyperhomocysteinemia is considered to be a risk factor for osteoporotic fractures in elderly men and women. very high plasma homocysteine levels are a feature of homocystinuria, characterized by the early onset of osteoporosis. to determine the association between plasma homocysteine concentration and the risk of hip fracture in parkinson's disease patients receiving levodopa, we prospectively studied a cohort of elderly women with parkinson's disease.   methods we studied 199 elderly women with parkinson's disease receiving levodopa therapy, from whom blood samples had been obtained to measure plasma homocysteine. age-adjusted incidence rates of hip fractures were calculated for quartiles of plasma homocysteine concentrations. cox proportional-hazard regression was used to calculate hazard ratios for quartiles of homocysteine values.   results the mean duration of follow-up was 4.9 years. hip fractures occurred in 66 patients. the age-adjusted incidence rates per 1000 person-years for hip fractures, from the lowest to the highest quartile of plasma homocysteine levels, were 1.59 (95% confidence interval [ci], 1.01-2.24), 1.57 (95% ci, 0.98-2.19), 1.21 (95% ci, 0.61-1.72), and 26.98 (95% ci, 16.48-37.24). the risk of hip fractures was greater in the highest quartile than that in the lowest, and the risk was almost 2.4 times higher.   conclusion these findings suggest that the homocysteine concentration is an important risk factor for hip fractures in parkinson's disease patients receiving levodopa.
comparative genomics of metabolic capacities of regulons controlled by cis-regulatory rna motifs in bacteria rfam is a collection of rna sequence families, represented by multiple sequence alignments and covariance models (cms). the primary aim of rfam is to annotate new members of known rna families on nucleotide sequences, particularly complete genomes, using sensitive blast filters in combination with cms. a minority of families with a very broad taxonomic range (e.g. trna and rrna) provide the majority of the sequence annotations, whilst the majority of rfam families (e.g. snornas and mirnas) have a limited taxonomic range and provide a limited number of annotations. recent improvements to the website, methodologies and data used by rfam are discussed. rfam is freely available on the web at http://rfam.sanger.ac.uk/and http://rfam.janelia.org/.
immunohistochemical aspects of anti‐microbial properties in goat submandibular glands summarythe present review is focused on the main achievements realized in the lysozyme research field since the meeting held in 1972 to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the discovery of this enzyme. despite of extensive structural, physico-chemical, crystallographic, genetic, immunological and evolutionary studies devoted to lysozymes, their biological role is still not exactly known.
prevalence of genital chlamydia trachomatis infection among young men and women in spain chlamydia trachomatis infection, the most common reportable disease in the united states, can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (pid), infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain. although c. trachomatis is identified among many women who receive a diagnosis of pid, the incidence and timing of pid and long-term sequelae from an untreated chlamydial infection have not been fully determined. this article examines evidence reviewed as part of the centers for disease control and prevention chlamydia immunology and control expert advisory meeting; 24 reports were included. we found no prospective studies directly assessing risk of long-term reproductive sequelae, such as infertility, after untreated c. trachomatis infection. several studies assessed pid diagnosis after untreated chlamydial infection, but rates varied widely, making it difficult to determine an overall estimate. in high-risk settings, 2%-5% of untreated women developed pid within the approximately 2-week period between testing positive for c. trachomatis and returning for treatment. however, the rate of pid progression in the general, asymptomatic population followed up for longer periods appeared to be low. according to the largest studies, after symptomatic pid of any cause has occurred, up to 18% of women may develop infertility. in several studies, repeated chlamydial infection was associated with pid and other reproductive sequelae, although it was difficult to determine whether the risk per infection increased with each recurrent episode. the present review critically evaluates this body of literature and suggests future research directions. specifically, prospective studies assessing rates of symptomatic pid, subclinical tubal damage, and long-term reproductive sequelae after c. trachomatis infection; better tools to measure pid and tubal damage; and studies on the natural history of repeated chlamydial infections are needed.
the association of retinoic acid receptor beta2(rarβ2) methylation status and prostate cancer risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis background gene expression can be silenced through the methylation of specific sites in the promoter region. this mechanism of gene silencing has an important role in the carcinogenesis of prostate and other cancers. although tumor-associated stromal cells also exhibit changes in gene expression, promoter methylation has not been described in these cells.   methods tumor epithelia, tumor-associated stroma and normal epithelia, and stroma adjacent to tumor tissues were isolated from whole-mount prostatectomy specimens (two per patient) of patients (n = 5) with localized prostate cancer and from normal epithelia and stroma from benign prostate hyperplasia specimens (two per patient) from men (n = 5) without prostate cancer by using laser capture microdissection or expression microdissection. the methylation status of three genes important in prostate carcinogenesis, gstp1, rarbeta2, and cd44, were evaluated using quantitative methylation-sensitive polymerase chain reaction.   results gstp1 and rarbeta2 were methylated in the tumor epithelium of all five prostate cancer patients and in the tumor-associated stroma in four of the five patients. cd44 was methylated in the tumor epithelium from four of the five patients but not in the tumor stroma. gstp1 and rarbeta2 were methylated in normal epithelium of two and four patients, respectively, and in normal stroma of one and two patients, respectively, that were isolated from regions adjacent to the tumors and may have resulted from a tumor-field effect; cd44 methylation was not observed in normal epithelium or stroma. in contrast, normal epithelia and stroma from benign prostate hyperplasia specimens showed no promoter methylation in gstp1, rarbeta2, or cd44.   conclusions the observation of promoter methylation in the non-neoplastic cells of the prostate tumor microenvironment may advance our understanding of prostate cancer development and progression and lead to new diagnostic and prognostic markers and therapeutic targets.
autonomous development of natural interactive behavior for robots and embodied agents embodied synchrony of nonverbal behaviour in counselling: a case study of role playing school counselling chika nagaoka (nagaoka@educ.kyoto-u.ac.jp) sakiko yoshikawa (say@educ.kyoto-u.ac.jp) graduate school of education, kyoto university yoshida honmachi, sakyo, kyoto, 606-8501, japan. masashi komori (komori@isc.osakac.ac.jp) faculty of information science and technology, osaka electro-communication university 18-1 hastu-cho, neyagawa-shi, osaka, 572-8530, japan abstract experienced counsellors have mentioned that the client- counsellor relationship, which is of high importance in counselling, may be related to embodied synchrony of nonverbal behaviour, but there is little quantitative research on the topic. the present study captured the embodied synchrony of nonverbal behaviour in counselling from a multiple communication channel perspective, in order to examine the relationship between these channels. at the same time, the relation between embodied synchrony and the mental processes of the client or counsellor, such as the sense of trust between counsellor and client, was investigated. 9-24 participants rated visual and vocal embodied synchrony and sense of trust in role-playing school counselling scenes. the results indicated that embodied synchrony, such as body movement coordination, similarity of voice strength and coordination and smoothness of response timing, have a co- occurrence relation. moreover, significant correlations with evaluated sense of trust suggested that embodied synchrony can act as an indicator reflecting the mental process of a client or counsellor. counselling is a dialogue between a client and a counsellor who is a skilled listener, and is performed with the purpose of overcoming the client’s mental difficulties or obstacles. the counsellor's verbal/nonverbal responses are experientially known to encourage the client's speech, and have the assistance function of guiding the client's thinking from a confused state to a regulated state . conventionally, in the case of investigating and evaluating counselling, the counsellor’s verbal responses are examined as the key element, and only rarely attention is directed towards nonverbal responses. however, we may assume that nonverbal responses are also playing an important role in counselling. it is expected that analyzing the counsellor's nonverbal behaviour would give an important cue also about the characteristics of the response style of listeners in daily conversations. in this study, embodied synchrony is focused upon as a cue to investigating nonverbal behaviour in counselling. embodied synchrony is a phenomenon in which the interactants’ nonverbal behaviour synchronizes and becomes similar; the listener's movements of the head or arms may synchronize with the flow of the speaker's speech, or the way of speaking, postures, mannerisms, and facial expressions may become similar (e.g. cappella, 1981; hess, philippot, & blairy, 1999; feldstein & welkowitz, 1978; cheng & chartrand, 2003). up to the present, embodied synchrony has been described qualitatively by the subjective impressions of skilled counsellors with abundant experience in counselling, and has been considered to indicate the client-counsellor relationship, which is thought to be of primary importance in counselling. there is also some research which indicates quantitatively the congruence of posture in counselling dialogues (e.g. charny, 1966), as well as other studies that indicate the relation between embodied synchrony, such as congruence of posture, duration of pauses or response latencies (i.e., latency before responding to the partner's last utterance), synchrony of body movements, and empathy (maurer & tindall, 1983; staples & sloane, 1976; hall, harrigan, & rosenthal, 1995; bernieri, davis, rosenthal, & knee, 1994). for measuring the degree of embodied synchrony of nonverbal behaviour, a method suggested by bernieri & rosenthal (1991) has been used. this method consists in judges evaluating directly the degree of the overall embodied synchrony in order to quantify it. as opposed to the conventional single-channel approach in which attention is directed towards a particular channel which is examined in detail, this method attempts at capturing nonverbal behaviour on a multi-channel level. however, this method cannot take paralanguage into consideration. to our knowledge, there has been no such method that allowed quantifying vocal synchrony overall. therefore, in this study, an attempt to quantify vocal embodied synchrony overall, adapting bernieri et al. 's method to measure vocal embodied synchrony, in addition to quantifying embodied synchrony of body movement using this method, is carried out. in other words, it is one of this work’s purposes to capture embodied synchrony from a multi-channel perspective. the necessity for investigating embodied synchrony on a multi-channel level was implied by hall et al. (1995). in the present study, it is also examined whether embodied synchrony occurs as a
nf-kappab, and not mycn, regulates mhc class i and endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidases in human neuroblastoma cells. the endoplasmic reticulum (er) aminopeptidases erap1 and erap2 contribute to generate hla class i binding peptides. recently, we have shown that the expression of these enzymes is high and coordinated (with each other and with hla class i molecules) in immortalized b cells, but variable and imbalanced in human tumour cell lines of various non‐lymphoid lineages. herein, this issue was investigated in vivo by testing erap1 and erap2 expression in normal non‐lymphoid tissues and their malignant counterparts. erap1 and erap2 were detected exclusively in the epithelial cells of over half of the tested normal tissues. four erap1/erap2 phenotypes (+/+, −/−, +/− and −/+) were detected, and the presence of either or both enzymes was not necessarily associated with hla class i expression. in more than 160 neoplastic lesions, the expression of either or both aminopeptidases was retained, lost (most frequently, particularly erap1) or acquired as compared to the normal counterparts, depending on the tumour histotype. the double‐negative (−/−) phenotype was the most frequent, and significantly (p = 0.013) associated with a lack of detectable hla class i antigens. in selected neoplastic lesions, erap1 and erap2 were also tested for their enzymatic (peptide‐trimming) activities. expression and function were found to correlate, indicating that immunohistochemistry detects active enzymes in vivo. thus, dissociation in the expression of erap1, erap2 and hla class i may already be present in some normal tissues, but malignant transformation causes additional losses, gains and imbalances in specific tumour histotypes, and these alter the peptide‐trimming ability of tumour cells in vivo. j. cell. physiol. 216: 742–749, 2008, © 2008 wiley‐liss, inc.
multiview absolute pose using 3d – 2d perspective line correspondences and vertical direction a large number of absolute pose algorithms have been presented in the literature. common performance criteria are computational complexity, geometric optimality, global optimality, structural degeneracies, and the number of solutions. the ability to handle minimal sets of correspondences, resulting solution multiplicity, and generalized cameras are further desirable properties. this paper presents the first pnp solution that unifies all the above desirable properties within a single algorithm. we compare our result to state-of-the-art minimal, non-minimal, central, and non-central pnp algorithms, and demonstrate universal applicability, competitive noise resilience, and superior computational efficiency. our algorithm is called unified pnp (upnp).
phylogenetic information and experimental design in molecular systematics summarythe application of maximum likelihood techniques to the estimation of evolutionary trees from nucleic acid sequence data is discussed. a computationally feasible method for finding such maximum likelihood estimates is developed, and a computer program is available. this method has advantages over the traditional parsimony algorithms, which can give misleading results if rates of evolution differ in different lineages. it also allows the testing of hypotheses about the constancy of evolutionary rates by likelihood ratio tests, and gives rough indication of the error of the estimate of the tree.
safety and efficacy of topiramate in neonates with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy treated with hypothermia (neonati) topiramate (tpm) is a structurally novel broad spectrum anticonvulsant known to have a negative modulatory effect on the α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazole propionic acid (ampa)/kainate subtypes of glutamate receptors and some types of voltage‐gated na+ and ca2+ channels, and a positive modulatory effect on some types of γ‐aminobutyric acida (gabaa) receptors and at least one type of k+ channels in neurons. in an earlier work, we showed that the negative modulatory effect of tpm (100 μm) on ampa/kainate receptors in neurons is dependent on tpm modulation of the phosphorylation state of these receptors. in this work, we investigated the effect of tpm on ampa‐induced intracellular calcium ([ca2+]i) responses in cultured rat cortical astrocytes, with special interest in intracellular mechanisms. here, we report that the ability of tpm (1–100 μm) to inhibit ampa‐induced accumulation of ca2+ in astrocytes is inversely related to the level of protein kinase a (pka) ‐mediated phosphorylation of channels activated by ampa. the level of receptor phosphorylation was further determined with western blot using phosphorylation specific antibodies that recognize the glutamate receptor 1 (glur1) subunit phosphorylated on ser845. these results demonstrated that, even in cultured cortical astrocytes, tpm significantly reduced the phophorylation level of glur1 subunits. furthermore, it was shown that tpm binds to ampa receptors in the dephosphorylated state and thereby exerts an allosteric modulatory effect on the ion channel.
two e-selectin ligands, bst-2 and lgals3bp, predict metastasis and poor survival of er-negative breast cancer. hematogenous metastasis involves the adhesion of circulating tumor cells to vascular endothelium of the secondary site. we hypothesized that breast cancer cell adhesion is mediated by interaction of endothelial e-selectin with its glycoprotein counter-receptor(s) expressed on breast cancer cells. at a hematogenous wall shear rate, zr-75-1 breast cancer cells specifically adhered to e-selectin expressing human umbilical vein endothelial cells when tested in parallel plate flow chamber adhesion assays. consistent with their e-selectin ligand activity, zr-75-1 cells expressed flow cytometrically detectable epitopes of heca-452 mab, which recognizes high efficiency e-selectin ligands typified by sialofucosylated moieties. multiple e-selectin reactive proteins expressed by zr-75-1 cells were revealed by immunoprecipitation with e-selectin chimera (e-ig chimera) followed by western blotting. mass spectrometry analysis of the 72 kda protein, which exhibited the most prominent e-selectin ligand activity, corresponded to mac-2 binding protein (mac-2bp), a heretofore unidentified e-selectin ligand. immunoprecipitated mac-2bp expressed sialofucosylated epitopes and possessed e-selectin ligand activity when tested by western blot analysis using heca-452 mab and e-ig chimera, respectively, demonstrating that mac-2bp is a novel high efficiency e-selectin ligand. furthermore, silencing the expression of mac-2bp from zr-75-1 cells by shrna markedly reduced their adhesion to e-selectin expressing cells under physiological flow conditions, confirming the functional e-selectin ligand activity of mac-2bp on intact cells. in addition to zr-75-1 cells, several other e-selectin ligand positive breast cancer cell lines expressed mac-2bp as detected by western blot and flow cytometry, suggesting that mac-2bp may be an e-selectin ligand in a variety of breast cancer types. further, invasive breast carcinoma tissue showed co-localized expression of mac-2bp and heca-452 antigens by fluorescence microscopy, underscoring the possible role of mac-2bp as an e-selectin ligand. in summary, breast cancer cells express mac-2bp as a novel e-selectin ligand, potentially revealing a new prognostic and therapeutic target for breast cancer.
development of scn connectivity and the circadian control of arousal: a diminishing role for humoral factors? study objectives daily amounts of sleep and wakefulness are accumulated in discrete bouts that exhibit distinct statistical properties. in adult mammals, sleep bout durations follow an exponential distribution whereas wake bout durations follow a power-law distribution. in infant norway rats, however, wake bouts initially follow an exponential distribution and only transition to a power-law distribution beginning around postnatal day 15 (p15). here we test the hypothesis that the locus coeruleus (lc), one of several wake-active nuclei in the brainstem, contributes to this developmental transition.   design at p7, rats were injected subcutaneously with saline or dsp-4, a neurotoxin that targets noradrenergic (na) lc terminals. then, at p21, sleep and wakefulness during the day and night were monitored. the effectiveness of dsp-4 treatment was verified by measuring na, dopamine (da), and serotonin (5-ht) concentration in cortical and non-cortical tissue using high performance liquid chromatography.   results in relation to controls, subjects treated with dsp-4 exhibited significant reductions only in cortical and non-cortical na concentration. consistent with our hypothesis, the wake bout durations of dsp-4 subjects more closely followed an exponential distribution, whereas those of control subjects followed the expected power-law distribution. sleep bout distributions were unaffected by dsp-4.   conclusions these results suggest that the fundamental developmental transition in the statistical structure of wake bout durations is effected in part by changes in noradrenergic lc functioning. considered within the domain of network theory, the hub-like connectivity of the lc may have important implications for the maintenance of network function in the face of random or targeted neural degeneration.
conserved and muscle-group-specific gene expression patterns shape postnatal development of the novel extraocular muscle phenotype. abstract the genetic and epigenetic influences that establish and maintain the unique phenotype of the extraocular muscles (eoms) are poorly understood. the vestibulo-ocular reflex (vor) represents an important input into the eoms, as it stabilizes eye position relative to the environment and provides a platform for function of all other eye movement systems. a role for vestibular cues in shaping eom maturation was assessed in these studies using the ototoxic nitrile compound 3’,3’-iminodipropionitrile (idpn) to eliminate the receptor hair cells that drive the vestibulo-ocular reflex. intraperitoneal injections of idpn were followed by a 2-week survival period, after which myosin heavy chain (myhc) analysis of the eoms was performed. when idpn was administered to juvenile rats, the proportion of eye muscle fibers expressing developmental and fast myosins was increased, while eom-specific myhc mrna levels were downregulated. by contrast, idpn treatment in adult rats affected only the proportion of fibers expressing developmental myhc isoforms, leaving the eom-specific myhc mrna unaltered. these data provide evidence that the vor modulates eom-specific myhc expression in development. the lack of significant changes in eom-specific myhc expression in adult eom following idpn administration suggests that there may be a critical period during development when alterations in vestibular activity have significant and permanent consequences for the eye muscles.
effect of exercise intensity on post-exercise oxygen consumption and heart rate recovery the on‐ and off‐transient (i.e. phase ii) responses of pulmonary oxygen uptake (v̇o2) to moderate‐intensity exercise (i.e. below the lactate threshold, θl) in humans has been shown to conform to both mono‐exponentiality and ‘on‐off’ symmetry, consistent with a system manifesting linear control dynamics. however above θl the v̇o2 kinetics have been shown to be more complex: during high‐intensity exercise neither mono‐exponentiality nor ‘on‐off’ symmetry have been shown to appropriately characterise the v̇o2 response. muscle [phosphocreatine] ([pcr]) responses to exercise, however, have been proposed to be dynamically linear with respect to work rate, and to demonstrate ‘on‐off’ symmetry at all work intenisties. we were therefore interested in examining the kinetic characteristics of the v̇o2 and [pcr] responses to moderate‐ and high‐intensity knee‐extensor exercise in order to improve our understanding of the factors involved in the putative phosphate‐linked control of muscle oxygen consumption. we estimated the dynamics of intramuscular [pcr] simultaneously with those of v̇o2 in nine healthy males who performed repeated bouts of both moderate‐ and high‐intensity square‐wave, knee‐extension exercise for 6 min, inside a whole‐body magnetic resonance spectroscopy (mrs) system. a transmit‐receive surface coil placed under the right quadriceps muscle allowed estimation of intramuscular [pcr]; v̇o2 was measured breath‐by‐breath using a custom‐designed turbine and a mass spectrometer system. for moderate exercise, the kinetics were well described by a simple mono‐exponential function (following a short cardiodynamic phase for v̇o2,), with time constants (τ) averaging: τv̇o2,on 35 ± 14 s (±s.d.), τ[pcr]on 33 ± 12 s, τv̇o2,off 50 ± 13 s and τ[pcr]off 51 ± 13 s. the kinetics for both v̇o2 and [pcr] were more complex for high‐intensity exercise. the fundamental phase expressing average τ values of τv̇o2,on 39 ± 4 s, τ[pcr]on 38 ± 11 s, τv̇o2,off 51 ± 6 s and τ[pcr]off 47 ± 11 s. an associated slow component was expressed in the on‐transient only for both v̇o2 and [pcr], and averaged 15.3 ± 5.4 and 13.9 ± 9.1 % of the fundamental amplitudes for v̇o2 and [pcr], respectively. in conclusion, the τ values of the fundamental component of [pcr] and v̇o2 dynamics cohere to within 10 %, during both the on‐ and off‐transients to a constant‐load work rate of both moderate‐ and high‐intensity exercise. on average, ≈90 % of the magnitude of the v̇o2 slow component during high‐intensity exercise is reflected within the exercising muscle by its [pcr] response.
the six metal binding domains in human copper transporter, atp7b: molecular biophysics and disease-causing mutations backgroundwilson﻿'s disease ﻿with﻿ osseomuscular type is a rare condition, which often lacks typical hepatic and neurological symptoms and causes misdiagnoses easily. during the past 10 years, eight chinese patients of osseomuscular type of wilson's disease were identified in our clinic.methodsclinical information was gathered from medical records and follow-ups. the genetic testing was performed in each patient. serum ceruloplasmin, kayser-fleischer rings, liver function, brain magnetic resonance imaging and abdominal ultrasonography were also evaluated.resultsthe median age of onset is 12 years of age. the patients had their initial musculoskeletal conditions with arthralgia or joint deformity, while the hepatic or neurologic signs were minimal. most patients (6/8) eventually developed clinical neurological symptoms afterwards with a median interval of 36 months. all of them had normal liver function and low serum ceruloplasmin (<0.1 g/l). most patients (6/8) present with kayser-fleischer rings and abnormal hepatic ultrasonography. the arthralgia was resolved with copper chelation therapy.conclusionswilson’s disease with osseomuscular type occurs without typical hepatic or neurological symptoms, which makes the clinical diagnosis challenging. serum ceruloplasmin, abdominal ultrasonography, ophthalmic examination and genetic testing help to establish the diagnosis. early diagnosis can initiate an effective treatment and prevent the further damage.
signaling pathways that mediate skeletal muscle hypertrophy: effects of exercise training skeletal muscle is the most abundant tissue in the human body and its normal physiology plays a fundamental role in health and disease. during many disease states, a dramatic loss of skeletal muscle mass (atrophy) is observed. in contrast, physical exercise is capable of producing significant increases in muscle mass (hypertrophy). maintenance of skeletal muscle mass is often viewed as the net result of the balance between two separate processes, namely protein synthesis and protein degradation. however, these two biochemical processes are not occurring independent of each other but they rather appear to be finely coordinated by a web of intricate signaling networks. such signaling networks are in charge of executing environmental and cellular cues that will ultimate determine whether muscle proteins are synthesized or degraded. in this review, recent findings are discussed demonstrating that the akt1/foxos/atrogin-1(mafbx)/murf1 signaling network plays an important role in the progression of skeletal muscle atrophy. these novel findings highlight an important mechanism that coordinates the activation of the protein synthesis machinery with the activation of a genetic program responsible for the degradation of muscle proteins during skeletal muscle atrophy.
socio‐cognitive phenotypes differentially modulate large‐scale structural covariance networks empathy is a concept central to psychiatry, psychotherapy and clinical psychology. the construct of empathy involves not only the affective experience of the other person's actual or inferred emotional state but also some minimal recognition and understanding of another's emotional state. it is proposed, in the light of multiple levels of analysis including social psychology, cognitive neuroscience and clinical neuropsychology, a model of empathy that involves both bottom-up and top-down information processing underpinned by parallel and distributed computational mechanisms. the predictive validity of this model is explored with reference to clinical conditions. as many psychiatric conditions are associated with deficits or even lack of empathy, we discuss a limited number of these disorders including psychopathy/antisocial personality disorders, borderline and narcissistic personality disorders, autistic spectrum disorders, and alexithymia. we argue that future clinical investigations of empathy disorders can only be informative if behavioral, dispositional and biological factors are combined.
plastidic phosphoglucose isomerase is an important determinant of starch accumulation in mesophyll cells, growth, photosynthetic capacity, and biosynthesis of plastidic cytokinins in arabidopsis barley leaf adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase (agpase), a key enzyme of starch synthesis in the chloroplast stroma, was analysed, in both directions of the reaction, with respect to details of its regulation by 3-phosphoglycerate (pga) and inorganic phosphate (pi) which serve as activator and inhibitor, respectively. agpase was found to catalyse a close-to-equilibrium reaction, with the k(eq) value of approximately 0.5, i.e. slightly favouring the pyrophosphorolytic direction. when the enzyme was analysed by substrate kinetics, pga acted either as a linear (hyperbolic response) 'non-competitive' activator (forward reaction) or a linear near-'competitive' activator (reverse reaction). when the activation and inhibition patterns with pga and pi, respectively, were studied in detail by dixon plots, the response curves to effectors also followed hyperbolic kinetics, with the experimentally determined k(a) and k(i) values on the order of micromolar. the results suggest that the regulation of agpase proceeds via a non-cooperative mechanism, where neither of the effectors, when considered separately, induces any allosteric response. the evidence, discussed in terms of an overall kinetic mechanism/regulation of leaf agpase, prompts caution in classifying the protein as an 'allosteric enzyme'.
the butterfly fauna of wisconsin bogs: lessons for conservation europe has undergone substantial biotope loss and change over the last century and data are needed urgently on the rate of decline in different wildlife groups in order to identify and target conservation measures. however, pan-european data are available for very few taxonomic groups, notably birds. we present here the first overview of trends for an insect group within different biotopes across europe, based on data from the red data book of european butterflies. the most important biotopes for europe’s 576 butterfly species, including threatened species, are man-made or man-influenced, notably types of grassland or heath/scrub communities. our results show that butterflies are declining substantially across europe, with a decline in distribution of 11% over the last 25 years. the distributions of the 25 most ‘‘generalist’’ species are declining only slowly ( 1%) compared to specialist butterflies of grassland ( 19%), wetlands ( 15%), and forests ( 14%). on average, grassland butterflies have declined somewhat slower than farmland birds (annual decrease 0.8% compared to 1.5%), but woodland butterflies have decreased more rapidly ( 0.01% to 0.6%) than woodland birds, which are more or less stable. the sensitivity of butterflies to environmental changes and the availability of data across europe suggest that they are very good candidates to build biodiversity indicators and, along with other major groups such as birds, suitable to monitor progress towards the eu target of halting biodiversity loss by 2010.
does dietary folic acid supplementation in mouse ntd models affect neural tube development or gamete preference at fertilization? neural tube defects (ntd), including anencephaly and spina bifida, are a group of severe congenital abnormalities in which the future brain and/or spinal cord fail to close. in mice, ntd may result from genetic mutations or knockouts, or from exposure to teratogenic agents, several of which are known risk factors in humans. among the many mouse ntd models that have been identified to date, a number have been tested for possible primary prevention of ntd by exogenous agents, such as folic acid. in genetic ntd models such as cart1, splotch, cited2, and crooked tail, and ntd induced by teratogens including valproic acid and fumonisins, the incidence of defects is reduced by maternal folic acid supplementation. these folate‐responsive models provide an opportunity to investigate the possible mechanisms underlying prevention of ntd by folic acid in humans. in another group of mouse models, that includes curly tail, axial defects, and the ephrin‐a5 knockout, ntd are not preventable by folic acid, reflecting the situation in humans in which a subset of ntd appear resistant to folic acid therapy. in this group of mutants alternative preventive agents, including inositol and methionine, have been shown to be effective. overall, the data from mouse models suggests that a broad‐based in utero therapy may offer scope for prevention of a greater proportion of ntd than is currently possible. © 2005 wiley‐liss, inc.
the bar domain proteins: molding membranes in fission, fusion, and phagy ubiquitination of integral plasma membrane proteins triggers their rapid internalization into the endocytic pathway. the yeast ubiquitin ligase rsp5p, a homologue of mammalian nedd4 and itch, is required for the ubiquitination and subsequent internalization of multiple plasma membrane proteins, including the α-factor receptor (ste2p). here we demonstrate that rsp5p plays multiple roles at the internalization step of endocytosis. temperature-sensitive rsp5 mutant cells were defective in the internalization of α-factor by a ste2p-ubiquitin chimera, a receptor that does not require post-translational ubiquitination. similarly, a modified version of ste2p bearing a npfxd linear peptide sequence as its only internalization signal was not internalized in rsp5 cells. internalization of these variant receptors was dependent on the catalytic cysteine residue of rsp5p and on ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes that bind rsp5p. thus, a rsp5p-dependent ubiquitination event is required for internalization mediated by ubiquitin-dependent and -independent endocytosis signals. constitutive ste2p-ubiquitin internalization and fluid-phase endocytosis also required active ubiquitination machinery, including rsp5p. these observations indicate that rsp5p-dependent ubiquitination of a trans-acting protein component of the endocytosis machinery is required for the internalization step of endocytosis.
quantitative trait loci underlying milk production traits in sheep. genetic studies are under way for many complex traits, spurred by the recent feasibility of whole genome scans. clear guidelines for the interpretation of linkage results are needed to avoid a flood of false positive claims. at the same time, an overly cautious approach runs the risk of causing true hints of linkage to be missed. we address this problem by proposing specific standards designed to maintain rigor while also promoting communication.
sparc/osteonectin, an endogenous mechanism for targeting albumin to the blood–cerebrospinal fluid interface during brain development osteonectin (sparc, culture shock protein, bm-40) is a widely distributed glycoprotein which binds calcium and several extracellular matrix proteins, including interstitial collagens and thrombospondin, but whose physiologic role remains undefined. in the present studies, we have demonstrated that immunoreactive osteonectin is present in the distal cortical tubule and medullary tubules of murine kidney. we surveyed the renal epithelial cell lines llc-pk1, mdck, and ok for the expression of mrna encoding osteonectin. we found that osteonectin mrna is expressed by llc-pk1 and ok cells but not by mdck cells, as well as by adult kidney from several species. calcitonin and vasopressin, agents which increase camp in these cells, were found to decrease steady-state osteonectin mrna concentrations. we found that llc-pk1 cells produced osteonectin protein, that the protein was localized to intracellular granules, and that the protein bound hydroxyapatite in vitro. pulse-chase analysis revealed that osteonectin was secreted from the cell layer to the medium after a lag time of four to six hours and was secreted preferentially from the basolateral domain of the cell. the preferential secretion of the calcium-binding protein osteonectin from the renal epithelial cell is consistent with several possible functions, including a structural extracellular matrix protein, a participant in transepithelial ion transport, and an inhibitor of extracellular calcification.
on straight line segment detection this book introduces the reader to a recent theory in computer vision yielding elementary techniques to analyse digital images. these techniques are inspired from and are a mathematical formalization of the gestalt theory. gestalt theory, which had never been formalized is a rigorous realm of vision psychology developped between 1923 and 1975. from the mathematical viewpoint the closest field to it is stochastic geometry, involving basic probability and statistics, in the context of image analysis. the authors maintain a public software, megawave, containing implementations of most of the image analysis techniques developped in the book. the book is intended for researchers and engineers. it is mathematically self-contained and requires only the basic notions in probability and calculus.
rheumatologic emergencies background: primary cns vasculitis (pcnsv) is an uncommon disease in which lesions are limited to the brain and spinal cord. our objective was to evaluate the frequency, clinical features, and outcome of spinal cord involvement in pcnsv. methods: we retrospectively identified 101 consecutive patients with pcnsv. spinal cord involvement was documented for five. clinical findings, laboratory studies, and outcomes of patients with spinal cord involvement were assessed and compared with those without spinal cord manifestations. results: spinal cord symptoms developed before cerebral symptoms in one patient, concurrently in two, and after cerebral symptoms in two. cns biopsy specimens showed necrotizing vasculitis in three patients and granulomatous vasculitis in two. mri of the spinal cord showed enhanced thoracic lesions in all five. cerebral angiograms from four patients had normal findings. one patient had a fatal clinical course. the other four had relapses during follow-up but responded well to therapy and had favorable overall outcomes. at the last follow-up (median, 19 months after diagnosis), the four patients had recovered with slight or moderate residual disability. no significant differences in clinical and laboratory features were observed when comparing patients with or without spinal cord involvement. cerebral angiograms with evidence of vasculitis were significantly more frequent for patients without spinal cord involvement (p = 0.002). conclusion: spinal cord involvement was documented in 5% of patients with primary cns vasculitis. the thoracic cord was the predominantly affected site. other than myelopathy, clinical characteristics were similar to those of the patients without spinal cord involvement. glossary: atm = acute transverse myelitis; esr = erythrocyte sedimentation rate; nd = no data; pcnsv = primary cns vasculitis; wbc = white blood cells.
towards a universal data provenance framework using dynamic instrumentation a provenance-aware storage system (pass) is a storage system that automatically collects and maintains provenance or lineage, the complete history or ancestry of an item. we discuss the advantages of treating provenance as meta-data collected and maintained by the storage system, rather than as manual annotations stored in a separately administered database. we describe a pass implementation, discussing the challenges it presents, performance cost it incurs, and the new functionality it enables. we show that with reasonable overhead, we can provide useful functionality not available in today's file systems or provenance management systems.
the glycine transporter type 1 inhibitor n-[3-(4′-fluorophenyl)-3-(4′-phenylphenoxy)propyl]sarcosine potentiates nmda receptor-mediated responses in vivo and produces an antipsychotic profile in rodent behavior objective the authors investigated the clinical effects of d-cycloserine when added to treatment with conventional neuroleptics, olanzapine, or risperidone for treatment-resistant schizophrenia.   method twenty-four patients participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-week crossover trial with d-cycloserine, 50 mg/day, added to their fixed dose of antipsychotic medication. clinical ratings were performed every 2 weeks.   results d-cycloserine treatment was well tolerated and resulted in a significant reduction in negative symptoms (mean=15%). the degree of improvement did not differ between patients treated with conventional neuroleptics and those treated with olanzapine or risperidone.   conclusions these data support the efficacy of the addition of 50 mg/day of d-cycloserine to treatment with conventional neuroleptics and suggest that therapeutic benefits may also be attained when d-cycloserine is added to olanzapine or risperidone.

let the tree bloom: scalable opportunistic routing with orpl traditionally, routing in wireless sensor networks consists of two steps: first, the routing protocol selects a next hop, and, second, the mac protocol waits for the intended destination to wake up and receive the data. this design makes it difficult to adapt to link dynamics and introduces delays while waiting for the next hop to wake up. in this paper we introduce orw, a practical opportunistic routing scheme for wireless sensor networks. in a duty-cycled setting, packets are addressed to sets of potential receivers and forwarded by the neighbor that wakes up first and successfully receives the packet. this reduces delay and energy consumption by utilizing all neighbors as potential forwarders. furthermore, this increases resilience to wireless link dynamics by exploiting spatial diversity. our results show that orw reduces radio duty-cycles on average by 50% (up to 90% on individual nodes) and delays by 30% to 90% when compared to the state of the art.
determinants of preference for lesser-known species among cabinet-makers in oyo and osun states, nigeria olivia has extensive forests. many of these forests have been mined for three species of timber: mahogany (swietenia macrophylla), spanish cedar (cedrela odorata), and south american oak (amburana cearensis). extraction of these timber species has helped the bolivian economy generate foreign exchange and cope with past economic crises. however, the sector is now faced with a new challenge: the forests of boliviaareunable tosupply international markets with traditional species due to previous high levels of extraction. the forestry sector needs to utilize more of the “other” timber species. if products utilizing these species are not developed, bolivia’s forestland will likely be converted to other uses, and the potential for bolivia to remain a major tropical wood producer will be lost.
assessing biodiversity integrity for the conservation of grazed and burnt grassland systems: avian field metabolic rates as a rapid assessment tool in this study, we investigated the responses of two faunal groups, birds and arthropods, to varying degrees of disturbance caused by fire and grazing in south africa, eight study sites of varying fire frequency and stocking density were studied over two summer seasons (october–march). bird assemblages reflected habitat disturbance in a diversity of ways, driven by factors ranging from direct disturbance to changes in habitat structure and functioning, and shifts in food availability. similarly, arthropod diversity and abundance changed seasonally in response to management practices. fire frequency drives faunal assemblage structure and abundance and, in most cases, overrides the effects of grazing at all taxonomic levels. in particular, fire frequency strongly influenced grassland-breeding birds because farms are burnt in the territory-forming stage of the breeding cycle. insectivores and nectarivores were disproportionately impacted by intensive commercial management. of particular concern in this system is the yellow-breasted pipit (anthus chloris), which is regionally and globally vulnerable because of habitat loss. this species is sensitive to any form of habitat disturbance, highlighting the need for conservation attention in these grasslands. of the ten arthropod orders present in the study area, only orthoptera responded positively to burning. however, orthopterans made up on average 78% of arthropod biomass in moist highland grasslands, resulting in high grasshopper biomass on annually burnt farms: this high biomass in turn supports an abundance of insectivores. this reinforces the importance of process-oriented data where a measure of performance, such as reproductive success, is considered in assessing ecosystem condition.
harmonia axyridis (coleoptera: coccinellidae) in asia: a re-examination of the native range and invasion to southeastern kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan harmonia axyridis (pallas, 1773) (coleoptera: coccinellidae) is a ladybird beetle native to temperate and subtropical parts of asia. since 1916 populations of this species have been introduced throughout the world, either deliberately, or by accident through international transport. harmonia axyridis was originally released as a classical biological control agent of aphid and coccid pests in orchards and forests, but since 1994 it is also available as a commercial product for augmentative control in field and greenhouse crops. it is a very voracious and effective natural enemy of aphids, psyllids and coccids in various agricultural and horticultural habitats and forests. during the past 20 years, however, it has successfully invaded non-target habitats in north america (since 1988), europe (1999) and south america (2001) respectively in a short period of time, attacking a wide range of non-pest species in different insect orders. becoming part of the agricultural commercial pathway, it is prone to being introduced into large areas across the world by accident. we use the climex programme (v2) to predict the potential geographical distribution of h. axyridis by means of matching the climate of its region of origin with other regions in the world and taking in account biological characteristics of the species. establishment and spread seem likely in many regions across the world, including those areas which h. axyridis has already invaded (temperate europe, north america). based on the climex prediction a large part of mediterranean europe, south america, africa, australia and new zealand seem highly suitable for long-term survival of h. axyridis as well. in addition we evaluate climex as a strategic tool for estimating establishment potential as part of an environmental risk assessment procedure for biological control agents we discuss biological and ecological aspects necessary to fine-tune its establishment and spread in areas after it has been introduced.
two e-selectin ligands, bst-2 and lgals3bp, predict metastasis and poor survival of er-negative breast cancer. hematogenous metastasis involves the adhesion of circulating tumor cells to vascular endothelium of the secondary site. we hypothesized that breast cancer cell adhesion is mediated by interaction of endothelial e-selectin with its glycoprotein counter-receptor(s) expressed on breast cancer cells. at a hematogenous wall shear rate, zr-75-1 breast cancer cells specifically adhered to e-selectin expressing human umbilical vein endothelial cells when tested in parallel plate flow chamber adhesion assays. consistent with their e-selectin ligand activity, zr-75-1 cells expressed flow cytometrically detectable epitopes of heca-452 mab, which recognizes high efficiency e-selectin ligands typified by sialofucosylated moieties. multiple e-selectin reactive proteins expressed by zr-75-1 cells were revealed by immunoprecipitation with e-selectin chimera (e-ig chimera) followed by western blotting. mass spectrometry analysis of the 72 kda protein, which exhibited the most prominent e-selectin ligand activity, corresponded to mac-2 binding protein (mac-2bp), a heretofore unidentified e-selectin ligand. immunoprecipitated mac-2bp expressed sialofucosylated epitopes and possessed e-selectin ligand activity when tested by western blot analysis using heca-452 mab and e-ig chimera, respectively, demonstrating that mac-2bp is a novel high efficiency e-selectin ligand. furthermore, silencing the expression of mac-2bp from zr-75-1 cells by shrna markedly reduced their adhesion to e-selectin expressing cells under physiological flow conditions, confirming the functional e-selectin ligand activity of mac-2bp on intact cells. in addition to zr-75-1 cells, several other e-selectin ligand positive breast cancer cell lines expressed mac-2bp as detected by western blot and flow cytometry, suggesting that mac-2bp may be an e-selectin ligand in a variety of breast cancer types. further, invasive breast carcinoma tissue showed co-localized expression of mac-2bp and heca-452 antigens by fluorescence microscopy, underscoring the possible role of mac-2bp as an e-selectin ligand. in summary, breast cancer cells express mac-2bp as a novel e-selectin ligand, potentially revealing a new prognostic and therapeutic target for breast cancer.
sensitivity improvement of no-back-plate mems microphone using polysilicon trench-refilled process this study reports a cmos-mems condenser microphone implemented using the standard thin film stacking of 0.35 μm umc cmos 3.3/5.0 v logic process, and followed by post-cmos micromachining steps without introducing any special materials. the corrugated diaphragm for the microphone is designed and implemented using the metal layer to reduce the influence of thin film residual stresses. moreover, a silicon substrate is employed to increase the stiffness of the back-plate. measurements show the sensitivity of microphone is −42 ± 3 dbv/pa at 1 khz (the reference sound-level is 94 db) under 6 v pumping voltage, the frequency response is 100 hz–10 khz, and the s/n ratio >55 db. it also has low power consumption of less than 200 μa, and low distortion of less than 1% (referred to 100 db).
quadratic regularization with cubic descent for unconstrained optimization ∗ in this work we propose a class of quasi-newton methods to minimize a twice differentiable function with lipschitz continuous hessian. these methods are based on the quadratic regularization of newton’s method, with algebraic explicit rules for computing the regularizing parameter. the convergence properties of this class of methods are analysed. we show that if the sequence generated by the algorithm converges then its limit point is stationary. we also establish local quadratic convergence in a neighborhood of a stationary point with positive definite hessian. encouraging numerical experiments are presented.
two at once: enhancing learning and generalization capacities via ibn-net deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. we present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. we explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. we provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. on the imagenet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8× deeper than vgg nets [40] but still having lower complexity. an ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the imagenet test set. this result won the 1st place on the ilsvrc 2015 classification task. we also present analysis on cifar-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. the depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the coco object detection dataset. deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ilsvrc & coco 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of imagenet detection, imagenet localization, coco detection, and coco segmentation.
persistent staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: an analysis of risk factors and outcomes. background the causes of persistent bacteremia (pb) due to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) are poorly understood. this investigation examined potential associations between pb with key clinical features and several in vitro bacterial genotypic and phenotypic characteristics, in isolates from 1 institution.   methods pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) relatedness, thrombin-induced platelet microbicidal protein (tpmp)-susceptibility phenotype, accessory gene regulator (agr) genotype and functionality (via delta-lysin production), and autolysis phenotypes were assessed in mrsa isolates from the bloodstream of 21 prospectively identified patients with pb (blood cultures positive after > or =7 days of therapy) and of 18 patients with resolving bacteremia (rb) (sterile blood cultures within the first 2-4 days of therapy) due to mrsa.   results the 2 groups had comparable baseline characteristics but differed in their clinical courses (e.g., endocarditis was more frequent in patients with pb than in those with rb [43% vs. 0%, respectively; p=.0016]); isolates from patients with pb exhibited higher rates of (1) survival in vitro after exposure to tpmp (22.4+/-14.8% vs. 11.6+/-6.5%, respectively; p=.005); (2) defective delta-lysin production (71.4% vs. 38.9%, respectively; p=.057); (3) non-agr genotype ii profile (100% vs. 77.8%, respectively; p=.037); and (4) overrepresentation of a specific pfge genotype (85.7% vs. 44.4%, respectively; p=.015).   conclusions isolates from patients with pb differed from those in patients with rb, in several in vitro characteristics. further studies will be necessary to define how these factors might affect clinical outcome.
epidemiology of leptospirosis in africa: a systematic review of a neglected zoonosis and a paradigm for ‘one health’ in africa leptospirosis is a widespread but under-reported cause of morbidity and mortality. global re-emergence of leptospirosis has been associated with the growth of informal urban settlements in which rodents are thought to be important reservoir hosts. understanding the multi-host epidemiology of leptospirosis is essential to control and prevent disease. a cross-sectional survey of rodents in the kibera settlement in nairobi, kenya was conducted in september–october 2008 to demonstrate the presence of pathogenic leptospires. a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed that 41 (18.3%) of 224 rodents carried pathogenic leptospires in their kidneys, and sequence data identified leptospira interrogans and l. kirschneri in this population. rodents of the genus mus (37 of 185) were significantly more likely to be positive than those of the genus rattus (4 of 39; odds ratio = 15.03). questionnaire data showed frequent contact between humans and rodents in kibera. this study emphasizes the need to quantify the public health impacts of this neglected disease at this and other urban sites in africa.

genomic regions influencing seminal root traits in barley grain dormancy provides protection against pre-harvest sprouting (phs) in cereals. composite interval mapping and association analyses were performed to identify quantitative trait loci (qtl) contributing grain dormancy in a doubled haploid (dh) barley population (nd24260 × flagship) consisting of 321 lines genotyped with dart markers. harvest-ripe grain collected from three field experiments was germinated over a 7-day period to determine a weighted germination index for each line. dh lines displaying moderate to high levels of grain dormancy were identified; however, both parental lines were non-dormant and displayed rapid germination within the first two days of testing. genetic analysis identified two qtl on chromosome 5h that were expressed consistently in each of the three environments. one qtl (donated by flagship) was located close to the centromeric region of chromosome 5h (qsdflag), accounting for up to 15% of the phenotypic variation. a second qtl with a larger effect (from nd24260) was detected on chromosome 5hl (qsdnd), accounting for up to 35% of the phenotypic variation. qsdflag and qsdnd displayed an epistatic interaction and dh lines that had the highest levels of grain dormancy carried both genes. we demonstrate that qsdnd in the nd24260 × flagship dh population is positioned proximal and independent to the well-characterised sd2 region that is associated with both high levels of dormancy and inferior malt quality. this indicates that it should be possible to develop cultivars that combine acceptable malting quality and adequate levels of grain dormancy for protection against phs by utilizing these alternate qtl.
a novel class of tubulin inhibitors that exhibit potent antiproliferation and in vitro vessel-disrupting activity the emergence of drug-resistant tumor cells is a major limiting factor in cancer chemotherapy. there is little information about the nature of such resistant variants among human cancer cell populations. doxorubicin (dox)-resistant sublines of the human sarcoma cell line mes-sa were selected by continuous in vitro exposure to dox. stepwise increases in dox concentration produced variants which were 25- and 100-fold resistant to dox. these sublines displayed marked cross-resistance to daunorubicin, dactinomycin, mitoxantrone, colchicine, vincristine, vinblastine, and etoposide and moderate resistance to mitomycin c and melphalan. cross-resistance was not observed, however, to methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, bleomycin, carmustine, or cisplatin. dox resistance in these cell lines appeared to be stable despite long periods of growth in drug-free medium. two additional marker chromosomes were identified in the 100-fold resistant variant, which indicated clonal selection during drug exposure, but no double minute chromosomes or homogeneously staining regions were noted. doxorubicin accumulation in the dox-resistant cells was reduced by approximately 50% compared to that of the sensitive mes-sa cells, as a result of enhanced efflux of dox from the resistant cells. there was no evidence of appreciable dox metabolism by either the sensitive or resistant cells. these studies demonstrate marked dox resistance and multidrug resistance arising in a human sarcoma line during exposure to dox. the pleiotropic nature of this resistance is similar to that described in other models. decreased drug accumulation due to enhanced drug efflux is identified as a major mechanism of resistance in these cells, although other factors may also be involved.
gene expression pathways of high grade localized prostate cancer tumor cell motility is one of the rate-limiting steps of invasion, which defines progression toward a more malignant phenotype. elevated expression of epidermal growth factor (egf) receptor in many cancers is associated with progression of superficial to invasive forms of the disease and is sometimes found in tumors that also have activating ras mutations, suggesting that both events contribute to tumor invasion. here we show that egf stimulates motility in human tumor cell lines, which harbor activating ha-rasv12 via a novel signal transduction pathway mediated by the small gtp-binding proteins rala and rhoa but independent of rac1 and cdc42. on egf stimulation, rala localizes to the cell membrane. in addition, activation of rala and expression of rho were increased by egf stimulation in both the nonmetastatic and metastatic variants of the same cell line. however, elevated levels of constitutively activated rala were only found in the metastatic variant. this is the first demonstration of an essential role for ral in egf-mediated cell motility and its potential contribution to tumor metastasis in human cancer.
the intensity of male-male interactions declines in highland songbird populations the thermal environment has pronounced effects on the energy costs of thermoregulation and affects an animal's allocation of energy to self-maintenance and parental care. consequently, the selection of reproductive periods, breeding habitats and nest-sites with a favourable microclimate can be advantageous, especially for birds breeding in harsh environments. in this study on alpine water pipits (anthus spinoletta), we evaluate the importance of spatial and temporal factors on thermoregulatory costs by combining laboratory measurements of metabolic rates under various temperatures with standard operative temperatures (tes) recorded in the field in different microhabitats. using these measurements we estimate the thermal and energetic consequences of nest locality and timing of reproduction. our results show: (1) in the morning, tes values were much higher on the east-north-east (ene) slope of a valley than on the west-south-west (wsw) slope; in the afternoon this pattern was reversed. as a consequence, energy costs (ehour) for thermoregulation on the ene slope were up to 0.6 rmr (resting metabolic rate at night) lower than on the wsw slope during morning hours and about 0.8 rmr higher during afternoon hours. (2) during the incubation and nestling phases of first and second broods, total energy expenditure for thermoregulation in the daytime (edaytime) was 0.2–0.3 rmr higher on the ene slope than on the wsw slope. (3) within slopes, edaytime was lower during second broods than during first broods, with differences of 0.06–0.07 rmr during incubation and of 0.32 rmr during nestling care. these differences correspond to the flying costs of females incubating eggs (0.09 rmr) and rearing nestlings (0.25 rmr). we conclude that nest placement in relation to microclimate can improve the female's energy budget, both in terms of the total daily expenditure and its diurnal pattern. from thermal considerations alone, delaying breeding into mid-summer would be advantageous, but this advantage is probably outweighed by the reduced chances for second and replacement clutches and by the necessity to complete moult before migration. die umgebungstemperatur beeinflusst den energieaufwand für die thermoregulation und bestimmt somit, wie viel energie ein tier für die selbsterhaltung benötigt und wie viel es für brutpflege aufwenden kann. daher ist es vorteilhaft, für die fortpflanzung zeiten und orte mit besonders günstigen mikroklimatischen bedingungen zu wählen. das gilt insbesondere für vögel, die in unwirtlichen biotopen wie z. b. alpinen regionen brüten. wir untersuchten den einfluss von brutzeit und -ort auf die energetischen kosten der thermoregulation am beispiel einer population des wasserpiepers (anthus spinoletta) im dischmatal bei davos (schweiz). dazu verknüpften wir drei verschiedene datensätze: a) ruhestoffwechsel (rmr), gemessen an gefangenen vögeln unter verschiedenen temperaturen, b) umgebungs- und nesttemperaturen im freiland während der brutzeit und c) standardisierte operative temperaturen (tes), ermittelt mit kupfervögeln in verschiedenen mikrohabitaten. die ergebnisse zeigen: (1) in den morgenstunden sind tes-werte am ost-nord-ost-hang (ono) deutlich höher als am west-süd-west-hang (wsw); am nachmittag sind die verhältnisse umgekehrt. als folge davon sind die energiekosten (ehour) der thermoregulation am ono-hang in den morgenstunden bis zu 0.6 rmr niedriger und nachmittags ca. 0.8 rmr höher als am wsw-hang. (2) in der bebrütungs- und nestlingsphase von erst-und zweitbruten war der gesamte energieaufwand für thermoregulation während der tagesstunden (edaytime) am ono-hang 0.2–0.3 rmr höher als am wsw-hang. (3) innerhalb jedes hanges war edaytime bei zweitbruten niedriger als bei erstbruten: 0.06–0.07 rmr während der bebrütung der eier und 0.32 rmr während der nestlingsphase. diese größenordnungen entsprechen den flugkosten von weibchen während der bebrütungszeit (0.09 rmr) bzw. der jungenaufzucht (0.25 rmr). unsere ergebnisse belegen, dass die wahl von klimatisch günstigen habitaten die energiebilanz von brutvögeln verbessern kann, sowohl in hinblick auf den täglichen gesamtaufwand als auch bezüglich der verteilung des energieverbrauchs über den tag. aus thermoregulatorischen gründen wäre auch eine zeitliche verlagerung des brutgeschäfts in die sommermonate (juli, august) vorteilhaft. das würde jedoch die möglichkeiten für ersatz-und zweitbruten verringern und die zeit für die mauser vor dem herbstzug verkürzen. da in unserem untersuchungsgebiet diese faktoren für eine erfolgreiche fortpflanzung eine größere bedeutung haben als der energieaufwand für die thermoregulation, ist der frühe — energetisch 6–32 % teurere — brutbeginn der vögel sinnvoll.
preprint anl/mcs-p795-0200 nonlinear programs with unbounded lagrange multiplier sets we show that an interior-point method for monotone variational inequalities exhibits superlinear convergence provided that all the standard assumptions hold except for the well-known assumption that the jacobian of the active constraints has full rank at the solution. we show that superlinear convergence occurs even when the constant-rank condition on the jacobian assumed in an earlier work does not hold.
comparison of the xylose reductase-xylitol dehydrogenase and the xylose isomerase pathways for xylose fermentation by recombinant saccharomyces cerevisiae evidence is presented that xylose metabolism in the anaerobic cellulolytic fungus piromyces sp. e2 proceeds via a xylose isomerase rather than via the xylose reductase/xylitol-dehydrogenase pathway found in xylose-metabolising yeasts. the xyla gene encoding the piromyces xylose isomerase was functionally expressed in saccharomyces cerevisiae. heterologous isomerase activities in cell extracts, assayed at 30 degrees c, were 0.3-1.1 micromol min(-1) (mg protein)(-1), with a km for xylose of 20 mm. the engineered s. cerevisiae strain grew very slowly on xylose. it co-consumed xylose in aerobic and anaerobic glucose-limited chemostat cultures at rates of 0.33 and 0.73 mmol (g biomass)(-1) h(-1), respectively.

testing mendelian inheritance from field-collected parasites: revealing duplicated loci enables correct inference of reproductive mode and mating system. abstract.reproduction is essential to all organisms if they are to contribute to the next generation. there are various means and ways of achieving this goal. this review focuses on the role of asexual reproduction for eukaryotic organisms and how its integration in a life cycle can influence their population genetics and evolution. an important question for evolutionary biologists as to why some organisms reproduce sexually, as opposed to asexually, is addressed. we also discuss the economic and medical importance of asexual organisms.
consensus of second-order discrete-time multi-agent systems with nonuniform time-delays and dynamically changing topologies in this paper, we discuss consensus problems for networks of dynamic agents with fixed and switching topologies. we analyze three cases: 1) directed networks with fixed topology; 2) directed networks with switching topology; and 3) undirected networks with communication time-delays and fixed topology. we introduce two consensus protocols for networks with and without time-delays and provide a convergence analysis in all three cases. we establish a direct connection between the algebraic connectivity (or fiedler eigenvalue) of the network and the performance (or negotiation speed) of a linear consensus protocol. this required the generalization of the notion of algebraic connectivity of undirected graphs to digraphs. it turns out that balanced digraphs play a key role in addressing average-consensus problems. we introduce disagreement functions for convergence analysis of consensus protocols. a disagreement function is a lyapunov function for the disagreement network dynamics. we proposed a simple disagreement function that is a common lyapunov function for the disagreement dynamics of a directed network with switching topology. a distinctive feature of this work is to address consensus problems for networks with directed information flow. we provide analytical tools that rely on algebraic graph theory, matrix theory, and control theory. simulations are provided that demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.
neuronal α-bungarotoxin receptors are α7 subunit homomers it has recently been demonstrated that alpha-bungarotoxin receptors, which behave as functional nicotinic receptors, are present in chick cns. in this paper, we report the purification and characterization of a functional alpha-bungarotoxin receptor from chick cerebellum, a nervous tissue in which a clear inhibition of induced nicotine effects has been reported in vivo. this receptor contains at least three subunits of apparent mol. wt 52,000, 57,000 and 67,000. the use of monoclonal antibodies specific for the alpha 7 subunit demonstrated that 75% of the molecules present in our purified preparation belong to the alpha 7 subtype and that this antibody labels the 57,000 band in western blot, thus indicating that this is the toxin binding subunit. reconstruction experiments in planar lipid bilayers show that this alpha-bungarotoxin receptor forms a cation selective channel whose opening is blocked by d-tubocurarine. binding experiments on immobilized receptors over an alpha-bungarotoxin-sepharose affinity column show that the ligand binding subunit is present in vivo in two copies per receptor. immunological, pharmacological and functional experiments show that this purified receptor is very similar, but not identical, to the previously characterized chick optic lobe receptor, thus indicating the heterogeneity of these alpha-bungarotoxin receptors in the cns.
kernel descriptors for visual recognition a key ingredient in the design of visual object classification systems is the identification of relevant class specific aspects while being robust to intra-class variations. while this is a necessity in order to generalize beyond a given set of training images, it is also a very difficult problem due to the high variability of visual appearance within each class. in the last years substantial performance gains on challenging benchmark datasets have been reported in the literature. this progress can be attributed to two developments: the design of highly discriminative and robust image features and the combination of multiple complementary features based on different aspects such as shape, color or texture. in this paper we study several models that aim at learning the correct weighting of different features from training data. these include multiple kernel learning as well as simple baseline methods. furthermore we derive ensemble methods inspired by boosting which are easily extendable to several multiclass setting. all methods are thoroughly evaluated on object classification datasets using a multitude of feature descriptors. the key results are that even very simple baseline methods, that are orders of magnitude faster than learning techniques are highly competitive with multiple kernel learning. furthermore the boosting type methods are found to produce consistently better results in all experiments. we provide insight of when combination methods can be expected to work and how the benefit of complementary features can be exploited most efficiently.
post-mortem assessment of hypoperfusion of cerebral cortex in alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. the amyloid-beta (a beta) peptide, which is derived from the amyloid precursor protein (app), is involved in the pathogenesis of alzheimer's dementia and impairs endothelium-dependent vasodilation in cerebral vessels. we investigated whether cerebrovascular autoregulation, i.e., the ability of the cerebral circulation to maintain flow in the face of changes in mean arterial pressure (map), is impaired in transgenic mice that overexpress app and a beta. neocortical cerebral blood flow (cbf) was monitored by laser-doppler flowmetry in anesthetized app(+) and app(-) mice. map was elevated by intravenous infusion of phenylephrine and reduced by controlled exsanguination. in app(-) mice, autoregulation was preserved. however, in app(+) mice, autoregulation was markedly disrupted. the magnitude of the disruption was linearly related to brain a beta concentration. the failure of autoregulation was paralleled by impairment of the cbf response to endothelium-dependent vasodilators. thus a beta disrupts a critical homeostatic mechanism of the cerebral circulation and renders cbf highly dependent on map. the resulting alterations in cerebral perfusion may play a role in the brain dysfunction and periventricular white-matter changes associated with alzheimer's dementia.
ion channel clustering enhances weak electric field detection by neutrophils: apparent roles of skf96365-sensitive cation channels and myeloperoxidase trafficking in cellular responses application of extremely low frequency pulsed dc electric fields that are frequency- and phase-matched with endogenous metabolic oscillations leads to greatly exaggerated neutrophil extension and metabolic resonance wherein oscillatory nad(p)h amplitudes are increased. in the presence of a resonant field, migrating cell length grows from 10 to approximately 40 microm, as does the overall length of microfilament assemblies. in contrast, cells stop locomotion and become spherical when exposed to phase-mismatched fields. although cellular effects were not found to be dependent on electrode type and buffer, they were sensitive to temporal constraints (phase and pulse length) and cell surface charge. we suggest an electromechanical coupling hypothesis wherein applied electric fields and cytoskeletal polymerization forces act together to overcome the surface/cortical tension of neutrophils, thus promoting net cytoskeletal assembly and heightened metabolic amplitudes. metabolic resonance enhances reactive oxygen metabolic production by neutrophils. furthermore, cellular dna damage was observed after prolonged metabolic resonance using both single cell gel electrophoresis ('comet' assay) and 3'-oh dna labeling using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. these results provide insights into transmembrane signal processing and cell interactions with weak electric fields.
combinatorial control of mrna fates by rna-binding proteins and non-coding rnas rna-binding proteins (rbps) are important regulators of eukaryotic gene expression. genomes typically encode dozens to hundreds of proteins containing rna-binding domains, which collectively recognize diverse rna sequences and structures. recent advances in high-throughput methods for assaying the targets of rbps in vitro and in vivo allow large-scale derivation of rna-binding motifs as well as determination of rna–protein interactions in living cells. in parallel, many computational methods have been developed to analyze and interpret these data. the interplay between rna secondary structure and rbp binding has also been a growing theme. integrating rna–protein interaction data with observations of post-transcriptional regulation will enhance our understanding of the roles of these important proteins.
mapping qtls for root system architecture of maize (zea mays l.) in the field at different developmental stages the objective of this study was to develop a phenotyping platform for the non-destructive, digital measurement of early root growth of axile and lateral roots and to evaluate its suitability for identifying maize (zea mays l.) genotypes with contrasting root development. the system was designed to capture images of the root system within minutes and to batch process them automatically. for system establishment, roots of the inbred line ac7729/tzsrw were grown until nine days after germination on the surface of a blotting paper in pouches. an a4 scanner was used for image acquisition followed by digital image analysis. image processing was optimized to enhance the separation between the roots and the background and to remove image noise. based on the root length in diameter-class distribution (rldd), small-diameter lateral roots and large-diameter axile roots were separated. root systems were scanned daily to model the growth dynamics of these root types. while the axile roots exhibited an almost linear growth, total lateral root length increased exponentially. given the determined exponential growth, it was demonstrated that two plants, germinated one day apart but with the same growth rates differed in root length by 100%. from the growth rates we were able to identify contrasting genotypes from 236 recombinant inbred lines (rils) of the cml444 x sc-malawi cross. differences in the growth of lateral roots of two selected rils were due to differences in the final length and linear density of the primary lateral roots, as proven by the manual reanalysis of the digital images. the high throughput makes the phenotyping platform attractive for routine genetic studies and other screening purposes.
genetic variants in piwi-interacting rna pathway genes confer susceptibility to spermatogenic failure in a chinese population. the evolutionarily conserved argonaute/piwi (ago/piwi, also known as paz-piwi domain or ppd) family of proteins is crucial for the biogenesis and function of small noncoding rnas (ncrnas). this family can be divided into ago and piwi subfamilies. the ago proteins are ubiquitously present in diverse tissues. they bind to small interfering rnas (sirnas) and micrornas (mirnas). in contrast, the piwi proteins are predominantly present in the germline and associate with a novel class of small rnas known as piwi-interacting rnas (pirnas). tens of thousands of pirna species, typically 24-32 nucleotide (nt) long, have been found in mammals, zebrafish, and drosophila. most pirnas appear to be generated from a small number of long single-stranded rna precursors that are often encoded by repetitive intergenic sequences in the genome. piwi proteins play crucial roles during germline development and gametogenesis of many metazoan species, from germline determination and germline stem cell (gsc) maintenance to meiosis, spermiogenesis, and transposon silencing. these diverse functions may involve pirnas and may be achieved via novel mechanisms of epigenetic and posttranscriptional regulation.
resilience and hope during advanced disease: a pilot study with metastatic colorectal cancer patients the relationship between spirituality and medicine has been the focus of considerable interest in recent years. studies suggest that many patients believe spirituality plays an important role in their lives, that there is a positive correlation between a patient's spirituality or religious commitment and health outcomes, and that patients would like physicians to consider these factors in their medical care. a spiritual assessment as part of a medical encounter is a practical first step in incorporating consideration of a patient's spirituality into medical practice. the hope questions provide a formal tool that may be used in this process. the hope concepts for discussion are as follows: h--sources of hope, strength, comfort, meaning, peace, love and connection; o--the role of organized religion for the patient; p--personal spirituality and practices; e--effects on medical care and end-of-life decisions.
sexual dimorphism in venom of bothrops jararaca(serpentes: viperidae). venom samples from four specimens of crotalus adamanteus from the same litter were analyzed for the content of a basic toxin by gel filtration. whereas the venoms of two snakes were essentially free of the toxin, two other contained about 5% and 11% toxin (w/w). the individual absence or presence of the toxin in the venom was constant, suggesting a genetically determined variation.
irg and gbp host resistance factors target aberrant, “non-self” vacuoles characterized by the missing of “self” irgm proteins dendritic cells (dcs) have the striking ability to cross-present exogenous antigens in association with major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class i to cd8(+) t cells. however, the intracellular pathways underlying cross-presentation remain ill defined. current models involve cytosolic proteolysis of antigens by the proteasome and peptide import into endoplasmic reticulum (er) or phagosomal lumen by the transporters associated with antigen processing (tap1 and tap2). here, we show that dcs expressed an er-resident 47 kda immune-related gtpase, igtp (irgm3). igtp resides on er and lipid body (lb) membranes where it binds the lb coat component adfp. inactivation of genes encoding for either igtp or adfp led to defects in lb formation in dcs and severely impaired cross-presentation of phagocytosed antigens to cd8(+) t cells but not antigen presentation to cd4(+) t cells. we thus define a new role for lb organelles in regulating cross-presentation of exogenous antigens to cd8(+) t lymphocytes in dcs.
greedy routing with anti-void traversal for wireless sensor networks suppose that a traveler arrives to the city of toronto, and wants to walk to the famous cn-tower, one of the tallest free-standing structures in the world. assume now that our visitor, lacking a map of toronto, is standing at a crossing from which he can see the cn-tower, and several streets s1, . . . , sm that he can choose to start his walk. a natural (and most likely safe assumption), is that our visitor must choose to walk first along the road that points closest in the direction of the cn-tower, see figure 1. a close look at maps of numerous cities around the world, show us that the previous way to explore a new, and unknown city will in general yield walks that will be close enough to the optimal ones to travel from one location to another. in mathematical terms, we can model the map of many cities by geometric graphs in which street intersections are represented by the vertices of our graphs, and streets by straight line segments. compass routing on geometric networks, in its most elemental form yields the following algorithm:
ibuprofen inhibits migration and proliferation of human coronary artery smooth muscle cells by inducing a differentiated phenotype: role of peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor γ the peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor‐γ (ppar‐γ) is constitutively expressed in primary cultures of rat microglia, the main population of brain resident macrophages, and its ligand‐dependent activation leads to the repression of several microglial functions. a few non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (nsaids), e.g. indomethacin and ibuprofen, show ppar‐γ agonistic properties. it has been proposed that ppar‐γ activation contributes to the potential benefits of the long‐term use of certain nsaids in delaying the progression of alzheimer's disease (ad). previous data have shown that the nsaid hct1026 [2‐fluoro‐α‐methyl(1,1′‐biphenyl)4‐acetic acid‐4‐(nitrooxy)butyl ester], a derivative of flurbiprofen which releases nitric oxide (no), reduces the number of reactive microglial cells in a variety of models. this evidence together with the chemical analogy with ibuprofen led us to investigate whether flurbiprofen and hct1026 interact with ppar‐γ and interfere with microglial activation. we found that a low concentration (1 µm) of hct1026, but not flurbiprofen, activated ppar‐γ in primary cultures of rat microglia, with kinetics similar to those of the synthetic agonist ciglitazone. the ppar‐γ antagonist gw9662 (2‐chloro‐5‐nitrobenzanilide) prevented the activation of ppar‐γ by hct1026. interestingly, unlike other nsaids that activate ppar‐γ at concentrations higher than those required for cyclooxygenase inhibition, hct1026 activated ppar‐γ and inhibited prostaglandin e2 synthesis at the same low concentration (1 µm). the results suggest that hct1026 may exert additional anti‐inflammatory actions through ppar‐γ activation, allowing a more effective control of microglial activation and brain inflammation.
nicotianamine synthase specifically expressed in root nodules of lotus japonicus basic cellular processes such as electron transport in photosynthesis and respiration require the precise control of iron homeostasis. to mobilize iron, plants have evolved at least two different strategies. the nonproteinogenous amino acid nicotianamine which is synthesized from three molecules of s-adenosyl-l-methionine, is an essential component of both pathways. this compound is missing in the tomato mutant chloronerva, which exhibits severe defects in the regulation of iron metabolism. we report the purification and partial characterization of the nicotianamine synthase from barley roots as well as the cloning of two corresponding gene sequences. the function of the gene sequence has been verified by overexpression in escherichia coli. further confirmation comes from reduction of the nicotianamine content and the exhibition of a chloronerva-like phenotype due to the expression of heterologous antisense constructs in transgenic tobacco plants. the native enzyme with an apparent mr of approximately 105 000 probably represents a trimer of s-adenosyl-l-methionine-binding subunits. a comparison with the recently cloned chloronerva gene of tomato reveals striking sequence homology, providing support for the suggestion that the destruction of the nicotianamine synthase encoding gene is the molecular basis of the tomato mutation.
indomethacin increases neurogenesis across age groups and improves delayed probe trial difference scores in middle-aged rats the hippocampus is one of the few areas of the rodent brain that continues to produce neurons postnatally. neurogenesis reportedly persists in rats up to 11 months of age. using bromodeoxyuridine (brdu) labeling, the present study confirms that in the adult rat brain, neuronal progenitor cells divide at the border between the hilus and the granule cell layer (gcl). in adult rats, the progeny of these cells migrate into the gcl and express the neuronal markers neun and calbindin-d28k. however, neurogenesis was drastically reduced in aged rats. six-to 27-month-old fischer rats were injected intraperitoneally with brdu to detect newborn cells in vivo and to follow their fate in the dentate gyrus. when killed 4–6 weeks after brdu labeling, 12- to 27- month-old rats exhibited a significant decline in the density of brdu- positive cells in the granule cell layer compared with 6-month-old controls. decreased neurogenesis in aging rats was accompanied by reduced immunoreactivity for poly-sialylated neural cell adhesion molecule, a molecule that is involved in migration and process elongation of developing neurons. when animals were killed immediately (12 hr) after brdu injection, significantly fewer labeled cells were observed in the gcl and adjacent subgranular zone of aged rats, indicative of a decrease in mitotic activity of neuronal precursor cells. the reduced proliferation was not attributable to a general aged- related metabolic impairment, because the density of brdu-positive cells was not altered in other brain regions with known mitotic activity (e.g., hilus and lateral ventricle wall). the decline in neurogenesis that occurs throughout the lifespan of an animal can thus be related to a decreasing proliferation of granule cell precursors.
diagnostic performance of five assays for anti-hepatitis e virus igg and igm in a large cohort study hepatitis e has been considered to be a travel-associated, acute, self-limiting liver disease that causes fulminant hepatic failure in specific high-risk groups only. however, hepatitis e virus (hev) infection can also be acquired in industrialized countries-hev genotype 3 infection is a zoonosis, with pigs and rodents serving as animal reservoirs. in recent years, cases of chronic hev infection that were associated with progressive liver disease have been described in several cohorts of immunocompromised individuals, including recipients of organ transplants. the topic of hepatitis e is therefore re-emerging and has raised the following important questions: what is the risk for hev infection in western countries (eg, from eating uncooked meat)? how frequently does chronic hepatitis e develop among human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients and recipients of organ transplants? what are the treatment options? what is the current status of vaccine development? what do we know about the pathogenesis of hev infection, and why does it have a more severe course in pregnant women? this review summarizes the current knowledge on the pathogenesis and treatment of hev infection.
nematode and mercury content in freshwater fish belonging to different trophic levels post minamata incident there has been awareness about mercury toxicity even among the general public. previous researches contributed a vast amount of data regarding acute mercury exposure, but gradually information about the low dose [ninomiya, t., ohmori, h., hashimoto, k., tsuruta, k., ekino, s., 1995. expansion of methylmercury poisoning outside minamata: an epidemiological study on chronic methylmercury poisoninig outside of minamata. environ. res. 70 (1) 47-50; lebel, j., mergler, d., lucotte, m., amorim, m., dolbec, j., miranda, d., arantes, g., rheault, i., pichet, p., 1996. evidence of early nervous system dysfunction in amazonian populations exposed to low-levels of methylmercury. neurotoxicology 17 (1) 157-167] of mercury toxicity has been trickling in. with mercury contaminating rain-, ground- and sea-water no one is safe. polluted water leads to mercury laced fish, meat and vegetable. in aquatic environments, inorganic mercury is microbiologically transformed into lipophilic organic compound 'methylmercury'. this transformation makes mercury more prone to biomagnification in food chains. consequently, populations with traditionally high dietary intake of food originating from fresh or marine environment have highest dietary exposure to mercury. extensive research done on locals across the globe have already established this, persons who routinely consume fish or a particular species of fish are at an increased risk of methylmercury poisoning. the easy access of the toxicant to man through multiple pathways air, water, food, cosmetic products and even vaccines increase the exposure. foetus and children are more susceptible towards mercury toxicity. mothers consuming diet containing mercury pass the toxicant to foetus and to infants through breast milk. decreased performance in areas of motor function and memory has been reported among children exposed to presumably safe mercury levels. similarly, disruption of attention, fine motor function and verbal memory was also found in adults on exposure to low mercury levels. it is an occupational hazard for dental staff, chloralkali factory workers and goldminers, etc. mercury has been found to be a causative agent of various sorts of disorders, including neurological, nephrological, immunological, cardiac, motor, reproductive and even genetic. recently heavy metal mediated toxicity has been linked to diseases like alzeihemer's, parkinson's, autism, lupus, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, etc. besides this, it poses danger to wildlife. therefore, it becomes imperative to spread the information regarding the threat of mercury exposure amongst the scientists and masses.
network-based relating pharmacological and genomic spaces for drug target identification oxytocin is a nonapeptide of the neurohypophyseal protein family that binds specifically to the oxytocin receptor to produce a multitude of central and peripheral physiological responses. within the central nervous system oxytocin is expressed by the neurons of the hypothalamus that project into higher brain centres and the posterior pituitary gland, from where it enters the circulation by release into the portal capillaries. centrally, it modulates, maternal, sexual, social and stress related behaviour. peripheral actions of oxytocin are commonly associated with smooth muscle contraction, particularly within the female and male reproductive tracts. local synthesis of oxytocin along with its receptor in these regions indicates the presence of local oxytocinergic systems. more sinister implications for oxytocin in autism, depression and several cancers have recently been identified. a greater understanding of the role of oxytocinergic mechanisms will determine the potential for targeting this regulatory peptide in the pharmacological management of these disorders.
distinct modulation of the endocannabinoid system upon kainic acid-induced in vivo seizures and in vitro epileptiform bursting considerable progress has been made, recently, in understanding the role of the endocannabinoid system in regard to neuroprotection. endogenous cannabinoids have received increasing attention as potential protective agents in several cases of neuronal injury. the endocannabinoid system is comprised of cannabinoid receptors (cb1 and cb2), their endogenous ligands (endocannabinoids) and proteins responsible for their metabolism. endocannabinoids serve as retrograde signalling messengers in gabaergic and glutamatergic synapses, as well as modulators of post‐synaptic transmission, interacting with other neurotransmitters, including norepinephrine and dopamine. furthermore, endocannabinoids modulate neuronal, glial and endothelial cell function and exert neuromodulatory, anti‐excitotoxic, anti‐inflammatory and vasodilatory effects. physiological stimuli and pathological conditions lead to differential increases in brain endocannabinoids that regulate distinct biological functions. the purpose of this review is to present the available in vivo and in vitro experimental data, up to date, regarding the endocannabinoid system and its role in neuroprotection, as well as its possible therapeutic perspectives. copyright © 2013 john wiley & sons, ltd.
efficient arq protocols with anti-jamming coding for cognitive radios while essentially all of the frequency spectrum is allocated to different applications, observations provide evidence that usage of the spectrum is actually quite limited, particularly in bands above 3 ghz. in this paper we present a cognitive radio approach for usage of virtual unlicensed spectrum (corvus), a vision of a cognitive radio (cr) based approach that uses allocated spectrum in a opportunistic manner to create "virtual unlicensed bands" i.e. bands that are shared with the primary (often licensed) users on a non-interfering basis. dynamic spectrum management techniques are used to adapt to immediate local spectrum availability. we define the system requirements for this approach, as well as the general architecture and basic physical and link layer functions of corvus.
evaluation of hydrologically relevant pcm climate variables and large-scale variability over the continental u.s. the land surface parameterization used with the community climate model (ccm3) and the climate system model (csm1), the national center for atmospheric research land surface model (ncar lsm1), has been modified as part of the development of the next version of these climate models. this new model is known as the community land model (clm2). in clm2, the surface is represented by five primary subgrid land cover types (glacier, lake, wetland, urban, vegetated) in each grid cell. the vegetated portion of a grid cell is further divided into patches of up to 4 of 16 plant functional types, each with its own leaf and stem area index and canopy height. the relative area of each subgrid unit, the plant functional type, and leaf area index are obtained from 1-km satellite data. the soil texture dataset allows vertical profiles of sand and clay. most of the physical parameterizations in the model were also updated. major model differences include: 10 layers for soil temperature and soil water with explicit treatment of liquid water and ice; a multilayer snowpack; runoff based on the topmodel concept; new formulation of ground and vegetation fluxes; and vertical root profiles from a global synthesis of ecological studies. simulations with ccm3 show significant improvements in surface air temperature, snow cover, and runoff for clm2 compared to lsm1. clm2 generally warms surface air temperature in all seasons compared to lsm1, reducing or eliminating many cold biases. annual precipitation over land is reduced from 2.35 mm day21 in lsm1 to 2.14 mm day21 in clm2. the hydrologic cycle is also different. transpiration and ground evaporation are reduced. leaves and stems evaporate more intercepted water annually in clm2 than lsm1. global runoff from land increases from 0.75 mm day21 in lsm1 to 0.84 mm day21 in clm2. the annual cycle of runoff is greatly improved in clm2, especially in arctic and boreal regions where the model has low runoff in cold seasons when the soil is frozen and high runoff during the snowmelt season. most of the differences between clm2 and lsm1 are attributed to particular parameterizations rather than to different surface datasets. important processes include: multilayer snow, frozen water, interception, soil water limitation to latent heat, and higher aerodynamic resistances to heat exchange from ground.
cubn and nebl common variants in the chromosome 10p13 linkage region are associated with multibacillary leprosy in vietnam with possibly incomplete nuclear families, the family based association test (fbat) method allows one to evaluate any test statistic that can be expressed as the sum of products (covariance) between an arbitrary function of an offspring's genotype with an arbitrary function of the offspring's phenotype. we derive expressions needed to calculate the mean and variance of these test statistics under the null hypothesis of no linkage. to give some guidance on using the fbat method, we present three simple data analysis strategies for different phenotypes: dichotomous (affection status), quantitative and censored (eg, the age of onset). we illustrate the approach by applying it to candidate gene data of the nimh alzheimer disease initiative. we show that the rc-tdt is equivalent to a special case of the fbat method. this result allows us to generalise the rc-tdt to dominant, recessive and multi-allelic marker codings. simulations compare the resulting fbat tests to the rc-tdt and the s-tdt. the fbat software is freely available.
angiotensin stimulates tgf-beta1 and clusterin in the hydronephrotic neonatal rat kidney. chronic unilateral ureteral obstruction (uuo) in early development activates the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system and leads to profound renal vasoconstriction, renal growth arrest, and interstitial fibrosis. to investigate the response of the at1 and at2 subtypes of the angiotensin ii (ang ii) receptors to uuo, sprague-dawley rats underwent uuo or control sham operation in the first 48 h of life and were studied 1-28 days later. renal mrna for renin, at1 and at2 receptor, and receptor binding and distribution were determined. in contrast to controls, renin mrna increased from 14 to 28 days in the obstructed kidney. after ipsilateral uuo, at1 mrna was suppressed at 1 day, but had increased compared with controls at 28 days. at2 receptor mrna fell rapidly in all kidneys from 1 to 3 days of age, after which it remained undetectable. compared with the intact opposite kidney, at2 mrna was suppressed in the obstructed kidney 1 day after uuo. compared with controls, at1 and at2 receptor binding was decreased by ipsilateral uuo at 1 day, whereas at1 binding was increased at 28 days. renal ang ii content was increased in the obstructed compared with the intact opposite kidney 28 days after uuo. in view of the increase in renal renin and angiotensin ii production resulting from uuo, increased renal at1 mrna and receptor binding are likely to contribute to the vasoconstriction and interstitial fibrosis of the neonatal kidney after prolonged uuo.
relationship between insulin and hypogonadism in men with metabolic syndrome. objective low levels of testosterone in men have been shown to be associated with type 2 diabetes, visceral adiposity, dyslipidaemia and metabolic syndrome. we investigated the effect of testosterone treatment on insulin resistance and glycaemic control in hypogonadal men with type 2 diabetes.   design this was a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study in 24 hypogonadal men (10 treated with insulin) over the age of 30 years with type 2 diabetes.   methods patients were treated with i.m. testosterone 200 mg every 2 weeks or placebo for 3 months in random order, followed by a washout period of 1 month before the alternate treatment phase. the primary outcomes were changes in fasting insulin sensitivity (as measured by homeostatic model index (homa) in those not on insulin), fasting blood glucose and glycated haemoglobin. the secondary outcomes were changes in body composition, fasting lipids and blood pressure. statistical analysis was performed on the delta values, with the treatment effect of placebo compared against the treatment effect of testosterone.   results testosterone therapy reduced the homa index (-1.73 +/- 0.67, p = 0.02, n = 14), indicating an improved fasting insulin sensitivity. glycated haemoglobin was also reduced (-0.37 +/- 0.17%, p = 0.03), as was the fasting blood glucose (-1.58 +/- 0.68 mmol/l, p = 0.03). testosterone treatment resulted in a reduction in visceral adiposity as assessed by waist circumference (-1.63 +/- 0.71 cm, p = 0.03) and waist/hip ratio (-0.03 +/- 0.01, p = 0.01). total cholesterol decreased with testosterone therapy (-0.4 +/- 0.17 mmol/l, p = 0.03) but no effect on blood pressure was observed.   conclusions testosterone replacement therapy reduces insulin resistance and improves glycaemic control in hypogonadal men with type 2 diabetes. improvements in glycaemic control, insulin resistance, cholesterol and visceral adiposity together represent an overall reduction in cardiovascular risk.
drought in forest understory ecosystems - a novel rainfall reduction experiment increasing greenhouse gas concentrations are expected to enhance the interannual variability of summer climate in europe and other mid-latitude regions, potentially causing more frequent heatwaves. climate models consistently predict an increase in the variability of summer temperatures in these areas, but the underlying mechanisms responsible for this increase remain uncertain. here we explore these mechanisms using regional simulations of recent and future climatic conditions with and without land–atmosphere interactions. our results indicate that the increase in summer temperature variability predicted in central and eastern europe is mainly due to feedbacks between the land surface and the atmosphere. furthermore, they suggest that land–atmosphere interactions increase climate variability in this region because climatic regimes in europe shift northwards in response to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, creating a new transitional climate zone with strong land–atmosphere coupling in central and eastern europe. these findings emphasize the importance of soil-moisture–temperature feedbacks (in addition to soil-moisture–precipitation feedbacks) in influencing summer climate variability and the potential migration of climate zones with strong land–atmosphere coupling as a consequence of global warming. this highlights the crucial role of land–atmosphere interactions in future climate change.
evolutionarily conserved genetic interactions with budding and fission yeast muts identify orthologous relationships in mismatch repair-deficient cancer cells mononucleotide repeat sequences are particularly prone to frameshift mutations in tumors with biallelic inactivation of the mismatch repair (mmr) genes mlh1 or msh2. in these tumors, several genes harboring mononucleotide repeats in their coding region have been proposed as targets involved in tumor progression, among which are also the mmr genes msh3 and msh6. we have analyzed the expression of the msh3 and msh6 proteins by immunohistochemistry in 31 colorectal carcinomas in which mlh1 was inactivated. loss of msh3 expression was identified in 15 tumors (48.5%), whereas all tumors expressed msh6. frameshift mutations at coding microsatellites were more frequent in msh3 (16 of 31) than in msh6 (3 of 31; fisher’s exact test, p < 0.001). frameshift mutations and allelic losses of msh3 were more frequent in msh3-negative tumors compared with those with normal expression (22 mutations in 30 alleles versus 8 mutations in 28 alleles; χ2, p = 0.001). biallelic inactivation was evident or inferred for 60% of msh3-negative tumors but none of the tumors with normal msh3 expression. in contrast, we did not identify frameshift mutations in the (a)8 tract of msh3 in a control group of 18 colorectal carcinomas in which the mmr deficiency was based on the inactivation of msh2. as it has been suggested that mutations of msh3 might play a role in tumor progression, we studied the association between msh3 expression and disease stage assessed by lymph node and distant metastases status. dukes stages c and d were more frequent in primary tumors with loss of msh3 expression (9 of 13), compared with tumors with retained expression (1 of 14; fisher’s exact test, p = 0.001), suggesting that msh3 abrogation may be a predictor of metastatic disease or even favor tumor cell spread in mlh1-deficient colorectal cancers.
assessing biodiversity integrity for the conservation of grazed and burnt grassland systems: avian field metabolic rates as a rapid assessment tool in this study, we investigated the responses of two faunal groups, birds and arthropods, to varying degrees of disturbance caused by fire and grazing in south africa, eight study sites of varying fire frequency and stocking density were studied over two summer seasons (october–march). bird assemblages reflected habitat disturbance in a diversity of ways, driven by factors ranging from direct disturbance to changes in habitat structure and functioning, and shifts in food availability. similarly, arthropod diversity and abundance changed seasonally in response to management practices. fire frequency drives faunal assemblage structure and abundance and, in most cases, overrides the effects of grazing at all taxonomic levels. in particular, fire frequency strongly influenced grassland-breeding birds because farms are burnt in the territory-forming stage of the breeding cycle. insectivores and nectarivores were disproportionately impacted by intensive commercial management. of particular concern in this system is the yellow-breasted pipit (anthus chloris), which is regionally and globally vulnerable because of habitat loss. this species is sensitive to any form of habitat disturbance, highlighting the need for conservation attention in these grasslands. of the ten arthropod orders present in the study area, only orthoptera responded positively to burning. however, orthopterans made up on average 78% of arthropod biomass in moist highland grasslands, resulting in high grasshopper biomass on annually burnt farms: this high biomass in turn supports an abundance of insectivores. this reinforces the importance of process-oriented data where a measure of performance, such as reproductive success, is considered in assessing ecosystem condition.
a interaction with the cxcr 4 third intracellular loop regulates endocytosis and signaling of wt and whim-like receptors chemotaxis mediated by chemokine receptors such as cxcr4 plays a key role in lymphocyte homing and hematopoiesis as well as in breast cancer metastasis. we have demonstrated previously that β-arrestin2 functions to attenuate cxcr4-mediated g protein activation and to enhance cxcr4 internalization. here we show further that the expression of β-arrestin2 in both hela and human embryonic kidney 293 cells significantly enhances the chemotactic efficacy of stromal cell-derived factor 1α, the specific agonist of cxcr4, whereas the suppression of β-arrestin2 endogenous expression by antisense or rna-mediated interference technology considerably attenuates stromal cell-derived factor 1α-induced cell migration. expression of β-arrestin2 also augmented chemokine receptor ccr5-mediated but not epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated chemotaxis, indicating the specific effect of β-arrestin2. further analysis reveals that expression of β-arrestin2 strengthened cxcr4-mediated activation of both p38 mapk and erk, and the suppression of β-arrestin2 expression blocked the activation of two kinases. interestingly, inhibition of p38 mapk activation (but not erk activation) by its inhibitors or by expression of a dominant-negative mutant of p38 mapk effectively blocked the chemotactic effect of β-arrestin2. expression of a dominant-negative mutant of ask1 also exerted the similar blocking effect. the results of our study suggest that β-arrestin2 can function not only as a regulator of cxcr4 signaling but also as a mediator of stromal cell-derived factor 1α-induced chemotaxis and that this activity probably occurs via the ask1/p38 mapk pathway.
semantic ontology mapping for interoperability of learning resource systems using a rule-based reasoning approach this paper proposes a semantic interoperability for data integration-sidi framework to integrate information from heterogeneous databases of difference providers in the same domain. a framework is designed to incorporate with important procedures based on ontology and semantic web services technologies. the semantic web services annotation is imperative to cope with the semantic service discrepancies with the help of ontology. the research also proposes the ontology mapping technique to determine the correspondences between information concepts with semantic bridges description to automatically construct the semantic rule-based inference. as a result, the framework has been applied to the healthcare domain to enable semantic interoperability among independently developed health information system-his for integrating healthcare data.
‘ballroom itself can either make you or break you’ – black gbt youths’ psychosocial development in the house ball community objectives i incorporated qualitative methods to explore how hiv-related stigma functions in new york city's house and ball community (hbc).   methods from january through march 2009, i conducted 20 in-depth 1-on-1 interviews with a diverse sample of new york city hbc members. interviews addressed perceptions of hiv-related stigma, the treatment of hiv-positive members in the community, and the potential impact of hiv-related stigma on risk behaviors.   results hiv-related stigma contributes to a loss of moral experience for hbc members. moral experience (i.e., threats to what really matters in a community) disrupts established social connections and hinders the attainment of "ball status" (i.e., amassing social recognition) in the local world of these individuals.   conclusions my recommendations address hiv-related stigma in the new york city hbc from the vantage of moral experience and highlight the need for longitudinal studies of individual house members and for the implementation of stigma-focused interventions in the community that utilize the unique ball status hierarchy and hbc network to influence social norms surrounding the treatment of hiv-positive community members.
the phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor roflumilast decreases ethanol consumption in c57bl/6j mice phosphodiesterase (pde) is a critical regulator of camp/protein kinase a (pka) signaling in cells. multiple pdes with different substrate specificities and subcellular localization are expressed in neurons. dopamine plays a central role in the regulation of motor and cognitive functions. the effect of dopamine is largely mediated through the camp/pka signaling cascade, and therefore controlled by pde activity. we used in vitro and in vivo biochemical techniques to dissect the roles of pde4 and pde10a in dopaminergic neurotransmission in mouse striatum by monitoring the ability of selective pde inhibitors to regulate phosphorylation of presynaptic [e.g., tyrosine hydroxylase (th)] and postsynaptic [e.g., dopamine- and camp-regulated phosphoprotein of m r 32 kda (darpp-32)] pka substrates. the pde4 inhibitor, rolipram, induced a large increase in th ser40 phosphorylation at dopaminergic terminals that was associated with a commensurate increase in dopamine synthesis and turnover in striatum in vivo. rolipram induced a small increase in darpp-32 thr34 phosphorylation preferentially in striatopallidal neurons by activating adenosine a2a receptor signaling in striatum. in contrast, the pde10a inhibitor, papaverine, had no effect on th phosphorylation or dopamine turnover, but instead robustly increased darpp-32 thr34 and glur1 ser845 phosphorylation in striatal neurons. inhibition of pde10a by papaverine activated camp/pka signaling in both striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons, resulting in potentiation of dopamine d1 receptor signaling and inhibition of dopamine d2 receptor signaling. these biochemical results are supported by immunohistochemical data demonstrating differential localization of pde10a and pde4 in striatum. these data underscore the importance of individual brain-enriched cyclic-nucleotide pde isoforms as therapeutic targets for neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders affecting dopamine neurotransmission.
association of polymorphism of the p22phox component of nadph oxidase in gastroduodenal diseases in japan backgroundincreased superoxide anion production increases oxidative stress and reduces nitric oxide bioactivity in vascular disease states. nad(p)h oxidase is an important source of superoxide in human blood vessels, and some studies suggest a possible association between polymorphisms in the nad(p)h oxidase cyba gene and atherosclerosis; however, no functional data address this hypothesis. we examined the relationships between the cyba c242t polymorphism and direct measurements of superoxide production in human blood vessels. methods and resultsvascular nad(p)h oxidase activity was determined in human saphenous veins obtained from 110 patients with coronary artery disease and identified risk factors. immunoblotting, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and dna sequencing showed that p22phox protein, mrna, and 242c/t allelic variants are expressed in human blood vessels. vascular superoxide production, both basal and nadh-stimulated, was highly variable between patients, but the presence of the cyba 242t allele was associated with significantly reduced vascular nad(p)h oxidase activity, independent of other clinical risk factors for atherosclerosis. conclusionsassociation of the cyba 242t allele with reduced nad(p)h oxidase activity in human blood vessels suggests that genetic variation in nad(p)h oxidase components may play a significant role in modulating superoxide production in human atherosclerosis.
expression of inducible 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase/pfkfb3 isoforms in adipocytes and their potential role in glycolytic regulation. to understand the insulin-induced activation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (pfk-2) of the bifunctional enzyme pfk-2/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase in heart, the effect of phosphorylation by protein kinases of the insulin signaling pathways on pfk-2 activity was studied. purified pfk-2/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase from bovine heart is a mixture of two isoforms (m r 58,000 and 54,000 on sds-polyacrylamide gels). the m r 54,000 protein is an alternatively spliced form, lacking phosphorylation sites for protein kinases. recombinant enzymes corresponding to them r 58,000 (bh1) and m r54,000 (bh3) forms were expressed and used as substrates for phosphorylation. the recombinant bh1 isoform was phosphorylated by p70 ribosomal s6 kinase (p70s6k), mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-1, and protein kinase b (pkb), whereas the recombinant bh3 isoform was a poor substrate for these protein kinases. treatment with all protein kinases activated pfk-2 in the recombinant bh1 preparation. phosphorylation of the recombinant bh1 isoform correlated with pfk-2 activation and was reversed by treatment with protein phosphatase 2a. all the protein kinases phosphorylated ser-466 and ser-483 in the bh1 isoform, but to different extents: p70s6k preferentially phosphorylated ser-466, whereas mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-1 and pkb phosphorylated ser-466 and ser-483 to a similar extent. we propose that pkb is part of the insulin signaling cascade for pfk-2 activation in heart.
a mitochondria-anchored isoform of the actin-nucleating spire protein regulates mitochondrial division masterminding mitochondrial fission mitochondria are highly dynamic and undergo fusion and fission and they move in cells. defects in mitochondrial dynamics are implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases. recent findings have suggested that mitochondrial fission occurs preferentially at endoplasmic reticulum (er) contact sites, with er circumscribing mitochondria and possibly promoting the constriction of mitochondria during fission. korobova et al. (p. 464) now suggest that an er-localized formin, inf2, is required for mitochondrial fission and that inf2-mediated actin polymerization facilitates mitochondrial constriction. actin filaments between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria promote mitochondrial fission. mitochondrial fission is fundamentally important to cellular physiology. the dynamin-related protein drp1 mediates fission, and interaction between mitochondrion and endoplasmic reticulum (er) enhances fission. however, the mechanism for drp1 recruitment to mitochondria is unclear, although previous results implicate actin involvement. here, we found that actin polymerization through er-localized inverted formin 2 (inf2) was required for efficient mitochondrial fission in mammalian cells. inf2 functioned upstream of drp1. actin filaments appeared to accumulate between mitochondria and inf2-enriched er membranes at constriction sites. thus, inf2-induced actin filaments may drive initial mitochondrial constriction, which allows drp1-driven secondary constriction. because inf2 mutations can lead to charcot-marie-tooth disease, our results provide a potential cellular mechanism for this disease state.
a cut-based heuristic to produce almost feasible periodic railway timetables during the last 15 years, many solution methods for the important task of constructing periodic timetables for public transportation companies have been proposed. we first point out the importance of an objective function, where we observe that in particular a linear objective function turns out to be a good compromise between essential practical requirements and computational tractability. then, we enter into a detailed empirical analysis of various mixed integer programming (mip) procedures — those using node variables and those using arc variables — genetic algorithms, simulated annealing and constraint programming. to our knowledge, this is the first comparison of five conceptually different solution approaches for periodic timetable optimization.
gbx2 directly restricts otx2 expression to forebrain and midbrain, competing with class iii pou factors pou domain transcription factors are required for neuropeptide expression in selected subsets of hypothalamic neuroendocrine neurons. we now report that expression of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gnrh) gene, which controls sexual development, is regulated by the pou protein scip/oct-6/tst-1. reverse transcriptase pcr cloning and rnase protection assays demonstrated the presence of scip/oct-6/tst-1 mrna in the gnrh-producing neuronal cell line gt1-7. the physiological relevance of this regulatory activity was suggested by the detection of scip/oct-6/tst-1 mrna in a subset of gnrh neurons in the hypothalamus of prepubertal female rats. coexpression of scip/oct-6/tst-1 in neuronal cells inhibited rat gnrh (rgnrh) promoter activity via three regions of the proximal rgnrh promoter containing scip/oct-6/tst-1 binding sites. dnase i footprinting, gel shift assays, and dna and protein mutagenesis studies indicated that both direct dna binding and protein-protein interactions are required for scip/oct-6/tst-1 modulation of gnrh gene expression. activation of scip/oct-6/tst-1 expression in terminally differentiated gnrh neurons may be a factor determining the ratio of phenotypically "inactive" versus "active" gnrh neurons during postnatal life.
increased cytosolic free mg2+and ca2+ in platelets of patients with vasospastic angina. there is controversy as to whether platelet intracellular free calcium ([ca2+]i) is increased in spontaneously hypertensive rats (shr) as compared with wistar-kyoto (wky) rats. discrepant results may be due to methodological problems including platelet activation during the collection process and leakage of intracellular dye used for [ca2+]i measurement. to provide further insight into this problem, [ca2+]i was estimated in fura-2-loaded platelets isolated from eight shr and seven wky rats at 12-14 weeks of age by using a two-syringe blood collection method and a correction method for fura-2 leakage. basal [ca2+]i was higher in shr than in wky rats (61.6 +/- 5.6 vs. 54.0 +/- 3.9 nm, p less than 0.02). however, the difference disappeared when a correction for fura-2 leakage was not used (109.7 +/- 18.4 vs. 94.9 +/- 9.2 nm, p less than 0.1). thus, differences in [ca2+]i between shr and wky rats may be obscured if dye leakage from platelets is not taken into account. thrombin (0.1 units/ml) induced a rise in [ca2+]i that was greater in shr than wky rats, both in the presence (491.4 +/- 31.6 vs. 377.5 +/- 21.7 nm, p less than 0.002) and absence (264.9 +/- 33.6 vs. 228.2 +/- 30.1 nm, p less than 0.05) of calcium in the media. these results indicate that thrombin-stimulated calcium influx as well as discharge of calcium from intracellular stores is increased in shr platelets. thus, under both basal and stimulated conditions, platelet calcium handling is abnormal in the shr.
a novel synthetic smoothened antagonist transiently inhibits pancreatic adenocarcinoma xenografts in a mouse model a smooth(ened) path to drug resistance the hedgehog (hh) signaling pathway has emerged as a key contributor to the growth of medulloblastoma, an aggressive brain tumor. gdc-0449, a drug that ramps down this signaling pathway by binding to the hh pathway component smoothened, was recently shown to induce rapid and dramatic tumor regression in a patient with metastatic medulloblastoma, but the tumor eventually developed resistance to the drug. yauch et al. (p. 572, published online 3 september) show that resistance arose because the tumor acquired a mutation in smoothened that disrupts binding of the drug. identification of this resistance mechanism may facilitate the design of next-generation drugs for this type of cancer. a mutation that prevents binding of a promising drug lead to its target protein confers resistance in a human brain tumor. the hedgehog (hh) signaling pathway is inappropriately activated in certain human cancers, including medulloblastoma, an aggressive brain tumor. gdc-0449, a drug that inhibits hh signaling by targeting the serpentine receptor smoothened (smo), has produced promising anti-tumor responses in early clinical studies of cancers driven by mutations in this pathway. to evaluate the mechanism of resistance in a medulloblastoma patient who had relapsed after an initial response to gdc-0449, we determined the mutational status of hh signaling genes in the tumor after disease progression. we identified an amino acid substitution at a conserved aspartic acid residue of smo that had no effect on hh signaling but disrupted the ability of gdc-0449 to bind smo and suppress this pathway. a mutation altering the same amino acid also arose in a gdc-0449–resistant mouse model of medulloblastoma. these findings show that acquired mutations in a serpentine receptor with features of a g protein–coupled receptor can serve as a mechanism of drug resistance in human cancer.
supporting aspect orientation in business process management a method of measuring the shunt resistance of diodes, specifically photodiodes, is examined and the procedure of how the method is implemented using labview is detailed. rudimentary comparison with other accepted methods in industry is done. the uncertainty analysis of the measurements using the specified method is given.
altered circulating concentrations of active glucagon-like peptide (glp-1) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (dpp4) in obese subjects and their association with insulin resistance. the hormone glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (glp‐1) is released from the gut in response to food intake. it acts as a satiety signal, leading to reduced food intake, and also as a regulator of gastric emptying. furthermore, glp‐1 functions as an incretin hormone, stimulating insulin release and inhibiting glucagon secretion from the pancreas in response to food ingestion. evidence suggests that the action or effect of glp‐1 may be impaired in obese subjects, even in those with normal glucose tolerance. glp‐1 impairment may help explain the increased gastric emptying and decreased satiety signalling seen in obesity. incretin impairment, probably associated with reduced insulinotropic potency of glp‐1, is also characteristic of type 2 diabetes (t2d). therefore, it is possible that incretin impairment may contribute to the pathophysiological bridge between obesity and t2d. this review summarises current knowledge about the pathophysiology and consequences of glp‐1 and incretin impairment in obesity, and examines the evidence for an incretin‐related link between obesity and t2d. it also considers the current literature surrounding the novel use of glp‐1 receptor agonists as a treatment for obesity in patients with normoglycaemia, prediabetes and t2d.
between-trial inhibition and facilitation in goal-directed aiming: manual and spatial asymmetries consistent with action–based theories of attention, the presence of a nontarget stimulus in the environment has been shown to alter the characteristics of goal–directed movements. specifically, it has been reported that movement trajectories veer away from (howard & tipper, 1997) or towards (welsh, elliott, & weeks, 1999) the location of a nontarget stimulus. the purpose of the experiments reported in this paper was to test a response activation model of selective reaching conceived to account for these variable results. in agreement with the model, the trajectory changes in the movements appear to be determined by the activation levels of each competing response at the moment of response initiation. the results of the present work, as well as those of previous studies, are discussed within the framework of the model of response activation.
nmda receptor antagonist effects, cortical glutamatergic function, and schizophrenia: toward a paradigm shift in medication development the classical dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia postulates a hyperactivity of dopaminergic transmission at the d(2) receptor. we measured in vivo occupancy of striatal d(2) receptors by dopamine in 18 untreated patients with schizophrenia and 18 matched controls, by comparing d(2) receptor availability before and during pharmacologically induced acute dopamine depletion. acute depletion of intrasynaptic dopamine resulted in a larger increase in d(2) receptor availability in patients with schizophrenia (19% +/- 11%) compared with control subjects (9% +/- 7%, p = 0.003). the increased occupancy of d(2) receptors by dopamine occurred both in first-episode neuroleptic-naive patients and in previously treated chronic patients experiencing an episode of illness exacerbation. in addition, elevated synaptic dopamine was predictive of good treatment response of positive symptoms to antipsychotic drugs. this finding provides direct evidence of increased stimulation of d(2) receptors by dopamine in schizophrenia, consistent with increased phasic activity of dopaminergic neurons.
triage drift: a workplace study in a pediatric emergency department in order to handle the high degree complexity that characterizes cooperative work in modern work settings, the articulation of the distributed activities requires a category of symbolic artifacts that stipulate and mediate articulation work. we call these artifacts 'coordination mechanisms'. from the evidence of sociological field studies, it is evident that computational coordination mechanisms must be malleable and interoperable. the paper describes a notation for constructing computational coordination mechanisms that meet these requirements.
task-dependent intermuscular motor unit synchronization between medial and lateral vastii muscles during dynamic and isometric squats electromyograms (emgs) are measured by bipolar surface electrodes that quantify potential differences. bipolar potentials over penniform muscles may be associated with errors. our assumption was that muscle activity can be quantified more reliably and with a higher spatial resolution using current measurements. the purpose of this work is: (a) to introduce the concept of current measurements to detect muscle activity, (b) to show the coherences observed over a segment of a typical penniform muscle, the gastrocnemius medialis where one would expect a synchronicity of the activation, and (c) to show the amount of mixing that is caused by the finite inter electrode resistance. a current amplifier was developed. emgs were recorded at 40% of maximum voluntary contraction during isometric contractions of the gastrocnemius medialis. emgs of twelve persons were recorded with an array of four peripheral and one central electrode. monopolar emgs were recorded for "all-potential", "center at current" and "all-current" conditions. coherence revealed the similarity of signals recorded from neighboring electrodes. coherence was high for the "all-potential", significant for the "current at center" condition and disappeared in the "all-current" condition. it was concluded that emg array recordings strongly depends on the measurement configuration. the proposed current amplifier significantly improves spatial resolution of emg array recordings because the inter-electrode cross talk is reduced.
functional and structural analyses of trichloroethylene-degrading bacterial communities under different phenol-feeding conditions: laboratory experiments the biodegradation of trichloroethylene (tce) and toluene, incubated separately and in combination, by indigenous microbial populations was measured in three unsaturated soils incubated under aerobic conditions. sorption and desorption of tce (0.1 to 10 micrograms ml-1) and toluene (1.0 to 20 micrograms ml-1) were measured in two soils and followed a reversible linear isotherm. at a concentration of 1 micrograms ml-1, tce was not degraded in the absence of toluene in any of the soils. in combination, both 1 microgram of tce ml-1 and 20 micrograms of toluene ml-1 were degraded simultaneously after a lag period of approximately 60 to 80 h, and the period of degradation lasted from 70 to 90 h. usually 60 to 75% of the initial 1 microgram of tce ml-1 was degraded, whereas 100% of the toluene disappeared. a second addition of 20 micrograms of toluene ml-1 to a flask with residual tce resulted in another 10 to 20% removal of the chemical. initial rates of degradation of toluene and tce were similar at 32, 25, and 18 degrees c; however, the lag period increased with decreasing temperature. there was little difference in degradation of toluene and tce at soil moisture contents of 16, 25, and 30%, whereas there was no detectable degradation at 5 and 2.5% moisture. the addition of phenol, but not benzoate, stimulated the degradation of tce in rindge and yolo silt loam soils, methanol and ethylene slightly stimulated tce degradation in rindge soil, glucose had no effect in either soil, and dissolved organic carbon extracted from soil strongly sorbed tce but did not affect its rate of biodegradation.
a soxhlet extract of gongronema latifolium retains moderate blood glucose lowering effect and produces structural recovery in the pancreas of stz-induced diabetic rats ethnopharmacological relevance traditional healers in nigeria use a combination of decoctions from green leafy vegetables in their blood glucose (bg) lowering recipes. three plants vernonia amygdalina (del.) (va), gongronema latifolium (benth.) (gl) and occimum gratissimum (linn.) (og) are found consistently in such recipes. whereas the anti-diabetic properties of extracts of these plants have been reported in animal models, little is known about the effects of their aqueous decoctions (singly or in combinations) on oral glucose tolerance (ogt) in humans.   materials and methods twenty seven subjects were recruited and (on separate days) were given 150 ml of water, va, gl and og decoctions or blends of the decoctions to drink 45 min before a 2-h ogtt. their ogtt curves were plotted and areas under the curves (aucs) calculated.   results the results show that each of the three decoctions neither altered the peak time of the ogtt nor significantly (p>0.05) reduced the bg concentrations (bgcs) at any time point on the test curves relative to the baseline. va, og and gl gave 0.4, 0.2 and 2.8% reductions in the aucs, respectively, relative to the baseline. blending gl and va did not improve the results. however, a decoction containing the three vegetables in equal proportions significantly reduced the bgcs at 90 (96.8 ± 9.5 vs. 107.1 ± 10.2mg/dl; p=0.041) and 120 (92.8 ± 14.3 vs. 102.5 ± 12.1mg/dl; p=0.037) minutes relative to the baseline, and gave better reductions in the aucs (4.1%).   conclusion the decoction containing the three vegetables was found to be superior in activity to any 1, or blends of only 2, of the 3 decoctions. this is a case of positive synergism, and justifies the use of these plants in ethnopharmacological bg lowering recipes.
the role of serum total ghrelin level elevation in colon cancer patients. small synthetic molecules called growth-hormone secretagogues (ghss) stimulate the release of growth hormone (gh) from the pituitary. they act through ghs-r, a g-protein-coupled receptor for which the ligand is unknown. recent cloning of ghs-r strongly suggests that an endogenous ligand for the receptor does exist and that there is a mechanism for regulating gh release that is distinct from its regulation by hypothalamic growth-hormone-releasing hormone (ghrh). we now report the purification and identification in rat stomach of an endogenous ligand specific for ghs-r. the purified ligand is a peptide of 28 amino acids, in which the serine 3 residue is n-octanoylated. the acylated peptide specifically releases gh both in vivo and in vitro, and o-n-octanoylation at serine 3 is essential for the activity. we designate the gh-releasing peptide ‘ghrelin’ (ghre is the proto-indo-european root of the word ‘grow’). human ghrelin is homologous to rat ghrelin apart from two amino acids. the occurrence of ghrelin in both rat and human indicates that gh release from the pituitary may be regulated not only by hypothalamic ghrh, but also by ghrelin.
identification of mycoparasitism-related genes against the phytopathogen sclerotinia sclerotiorum through transcriptome and expression profile analysis in trichoderma harzianum the trichoderma harzianum qid74 gene encodes a cysteine-rich cell wall protein that has an important role in adherence to hydrophobic surfaces and cellular protection; this gene was upregulated in trichoderma high-density oligonucleotide (hdo) microarrays in interaction with tomato roots. using a collection of qid74-overexpressing and disrupted mutants the role of this gene in cucumber and tomato root architecture was analysed in hydroponic and soil systems under greenhouse conditions. no significant differences were found in the pattern of root colonization and the length of primary roots of cucumber or tomato plants inoculated by t. harzianum cect 2413 wild-type (wt) strain or any of the qid74 transformants. however, compared to the wt treatment, lateral roots were significantly longer in plants inoculated with the overexpressing transformants, and shorter in those treated with the disruptant strains. microscopic observations revealed more and longer secondary root hairs in cucumber plants treated with the qid74-overexpressing mutants and fewer and shorter hairs in roots treated with qid74-disrupted transformants, compared to those observed in plants inoculated with the wt strain. qid74-induced modifications in root architecture increased the total absorptive surface, facilitating nutrient uptake and translocation of nutrients in the shoots, resulting in increased plant biomass through an efficient use of npk and micronutrients.
personalized nutrition and obesity background— previous studies on gene-lifestyle interaction and obesity have focused mostly on the fto gene and physical activity, whereas little attention has been paid to sedentary behavior as indicated by television (tv) watching. methods and results— we analyzed interactions between tv watching, leisure time physical activity, and genetic predisposition in relation to body mass index (bmi) in 7740 women and 4564 men from 2 prospective cohorts: the nurses' health study and the health professionals follow-up study. data on physical activity and tv watching were collected 2 years before assessment of bmi. a weighted genetic risk score was calculated on the basis of 32 established bmi-associated variants. in both women and men, the genetic associations with bmi strengthened with increased hours of tv watching. an increment of 10 points in the weighted genetic risk score was associated with 0.8 (se, 0.4), 0.8 (se, 0.2), 1.4 (se, 0.2), 1.5 (se, 0.2), and 3.4 (se, 1.0) kg/m2 higher bmi across the 5 categories of tv watching (0–1, 2–5, 6–20, 21–40, and >40 h/wk; p for interaction=0.001). in contrast, the genetic association with bmi weakened with increased levels of physical activity. an increment of 10 points in the weighted genetic risk score was associated with 1.5 (se, 0.2), 1.3 (se, 0.2), 1.2 (se, 0.2), 1.2 (se, 0.2), and 0.8 (se, 0.2) kg/m2 higher bmi across the quintiles of physical activity. the interactions of tv watching and physical activity with genetic predisposition in relation to bmi were independent of each other. conclusions— a sedentary lifestyle, indicated by prolonged tv watching, may accentuate the predisposition to elevated adiposity, whereas greater leisure time physical activity may attenuate the genetic association.
coronary atherosclerotic lesions in patients with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm a morphological examination of aging was performed on 141 normal hearts selected from a total of 972 consecutive autopsies on persons aged 60 years or over. the average heart weight was 270 ± 41 g. the circumference of the valvular ring was 99 ± 10 mm in the tricuspid valve, 68 ± 8 mm in the pulmonic valve, 83 ± 10 mm in the mitral valve, and 73 ± 7 mm in the aortic valve. the thickness of the tricuspid valve (anterior leaflet) was 0.9 ± 0.3 mm, pulmonic (anterior cusp) 0.4 ± 0.3 mm, mitral (anterior leaflet) 1.3 ± 0.6 mm, and aortic (posterior cusp) 1.0 ± 0.6 mm. cardiac chamber volumes were as follows: 40 ± 14 ml in the right atrium, 22 ± 7 ml in the right ventricle, 37 ± 12 ml in the left atrium, and 7.3 ± 3.4 ml in the left ventricle. the circumference of the tricuspid ring was the largest. left-sided valves were thicker than right-sides valves, and atrioventricular valves were thicker than semilunar valves. cardiac chamber volumes were generally larger on the right side. because this study was limited to hearts from persons aged 60 years or over, age-related changes were observed in only four parameters: (i) the circumference of the aortic valvular ring, (ii) the thickness of the aortic posterior cusp, (iii) the thickness of the pulmonic anterior cusp, and (iv) the volume of the left ventricle. with increasing age the aortic valvular ring dilated, the aortic posterior cusp and the pulmonic anterior cusp thickened, and the left ventricular volume diminished.
probable epitopes the protein data bank (pdb), at brookhaven national laboratory, is a database containing information on experimentally determined three-dimensional structures of proteins, nucleic acids, and other biological macromolecules, with approximately 9000 entries. the pdb has a 27-year history of service to a global community of researchers, educators, and students in a wide variety of scientific disciplines. data are easily submitted via pdb's www-based tool autodep, in either pdb or mmcif format, and are most conveniently examined via pdb's www-based tool 3db browser. collaborative centers have been, and continue to be, established worldwide to assist in data deposition, archiving, and distribution.
automated classification of mouse pup isolation syllables: from cluster analysis to an excel-based “mouse pup syllable classification calculator” qualitative impairments in communication, such as delayed language and poor interactive communication skills, are fundamental to the diagnosis of autism. investigations into social communication in adult btbr t+tf/j (btbr) mice are needed to determine whether this inbred strain incorporates phenotypes relevant to the second diagnostic symptom of autism, communication deficits, along with its strong behavioral phenotypes relevant to the first and third diagnostic symptoms, impairments in social interactions and high levels of repetitive behavior. the aim of the present study was to simultaneously measure female urine‐elicited scent marking and ultrasonic vocalizations in adult male btbr mice, in comparison with a standard control strain with high sociability, c57bl/6j (b6), for the assessment of a potential communication deficit in btbr. adult male btbr mice displayed lower scent marking and minimal ultrasonic vocalization responses to female urine obtained from both b6 and btbr females. lower scent marking and ultrasonic vocalizations in a social setting by btbr, as compared with b6, are consistent with the well‐replicated social deficits in this inbred mouse strain. our findings support the interpretation that btbr incorporate communication deficits, and suggest that scent marking and ultrasonic vocalizations offer promising measures of interest in social cues that may be widely applicable to investigations of mouse models of autism.
a mitochondria-anchored isoform of the actin-nucleating spire protein regulates mitochondrial division masterminding mitochondrial fission mitochondria are highly dynamic and undergo fusion and fission and they move in cells. defects in mitochondrial dynamics are implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases. recent findings have suggested that mitochondrial fission occurs preferentially at endoplasmic reticulum (er) contact sites, with er circumscribing mitochondria and possibly promoting the constriction of mitochondria during fission. korobova et al. (p. 464) now suggest that an er-localized formin, inf2, is required for mitochondrial fission and that inf2-mediated actin polymerization facilitates mitochondrial constriction. actin filaments between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria promote mitochondrial fission. mitochondrial fission is fundamentally important to cellular physiology. the dynamin-related protein drp1 mediates fission, and interaction between mitochondrion and endoplasmic reticulum (er) enhances fission. however, the mechanism for drp1 recruitment to mitochondria is unclear, although previous results implicate actin involvement. here, we found that actin polymerization through er-localized inverted formin 2 (inf2) was required for efficient mitochondrial fission in mammalian cells. inf2 functioned upstream of drp1. actin filaments appeared to accumulate between mitochondria and inf2-enriched er membranes at constriction sites. thus, inf2-induced actin filaments may drive initial mitochondrial constriction, which allows drp1-driven secondary constriction. because inf2 mutations can lead to charcot-marie-tooth disease, our results provide a potential cellular mechanism for this disease state.
mrc1 marks early-firing origins and coordinates timing and efficiency of initiation in fission yeast † the swi1‐swi3 replication fork protection complex and mrc1 protein are required for stabilization of stalled replication forks in fission yeast. hsk1 kinase also plays roles in checkpoint responses elicited by arrested replication forks. we show that both swi1 and swi3, the abundance of which are interdependent, are required for chromatin association of mrc1. co‐immunoprecipitation experiments show the interactions of swi1‐swi3, mrc1 and hsk1. mrc1 interacts with swi3 and hsk1 proteins through its central segment (378–879) containing a sq/tq cluster, and this segment is sufficient for checkpoint reaction. the sq/tq cluster segment (536–673) is essential but not sufficient for the interactions and for resistance to replication inhibitor hydroxyurea. mrc1 protein level is increased in hsk1–89 cells due to apparent stabilization, and we have identified a potential phosphodegron sequence. these results suggest that interactions of the swi1‐swi3 complex and hsk1 kinase with mrc1 may play a role in cellular responses to stalled replication forks in fission yeast.
an integrated theory of language production and comprehension a number of internal model concepts are now widespread in neuroscience and cognitive science. these concepts are supported by behavioral, neurophysiological, and imaging data; furthermore, these models have had their structures and functions revealed by such data. in particular, a specific theory on inverse dynamics model learning is directly supported by unit recordings from cerebellar purkinje cells. multiple paired forward inverse models describing how diverse objects and environments can be controlled and learned separately have recently been proposed. the 'minimum variance model' is another major recent advance in the computational theory of motor control. this model integrates two furiously disputed approaches on trajectory planning, strongly suggesting that both kinematic and dynamic internal models are utilized in movement planning and control.
co-expression of two sugar transporters in primary and lateral roots of etiolated glycine max seedlings* the transporters responsible for sugar uptake into non-photosynthetic sink tissues in plants, such as roots and flowers, have not been fully identified and analyzed. plants encode around 100 putative sugar transporters within the major facilitator superfamily, yet only a few have been studied. here we report the analysis of a sugar alcohol permease homolog (atplt5, at3g18830) from arabidopsis. a wide range of sugars including hexoses, pentoses, tetroses, a sugar acid, and sugar alcohols but not disaccharides induced inward currents in oocytes expressing atplt5. atplt5 expression also resulted in 14c-labeled substrate uptake in oocytes, indicating that atplt5 encodes an ion-coupled uptake transporter. k0.5 values for glucose and sorbitol were highly dependent on external ph. expression of atplt5 was found primarily in sink tissues: in the elongation zone of roots, in the inflorescence stem, and several floral structures, especially in the floral abscission zone. expression was induced by mechanical wounding and insect feeding. analysis of transport properties and expression in arabidopsis indicate that atplt5 functions to transport a wide range of sugars into specific sink tissues in the plant.
malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor presenting with hemoperitoneum in puerperium: report of a case with review of the literature background: malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors (m-gist) are rare mesenchymal tumors originating in the wall of the gastrointestinal (gi) tract. previous studies have included limited numbers of patients, and most included malignant and benign cases from throughout the gi tract. we reviewed the experience of a single tertiary cancer care center with m-gist of the small intestine only.methods: a prospective database identified all patients seen from 1989 to 1998. clinical and pathological data, treatment, and outcome were analyzed. overall median follow-up time was 24 months (range, 1-176 months).results: fifty patients (31 male, 19 female) were identified. mean age at diagnosis was 55 years. disease was localized in 11 patients, locally advanced (invasion into adjacent organs/peritoneum) in 24 patients, perforated in 4 patients, multiple primary lesions in 2 patients, and distant metastases in 9 patients. all patients underwent resection, which was complete in 70%. locoregional recurrence (lr) developed in 43% (median, 25 months), and distant metastases in 59% (median, 21 months) of patients at risk. at last follow-up, 14 patients were alive (6 disease-free), 2 had died disease-free, and 34 died with recurrent disease. overall survival (os) was similar for localized and locally advanced disease; os also was similar for patients with multiple primaries and distant metastases at diagnosis. patients were grouped into three stages: (i) patients with localized and locally advanced disease; (ii) patients with perforated; and (iii) patients with multiple primaries and distant metastases. actuarial os at 5 years was 41% (n = 50)—42% for those with complete resection and 8% for incomplete resection. univariable analysis showed that earlier stage at diagnosis (p = .001) and completeness of resection (p = .004) predicted for longer os.conclusions: most patients with m-gist of the small intestine relapse following resection, but survival may be prolonged. in univariable analysis, stage at presentation and complete resection were significant prognostic variables for os; grade was not significant. localized and locally advanced m-gist of the small intestine have a mean os > 5 years. complete resection should be the goal of initial surgical treatment.
penalized normal likelihood and ridge regularization of correlation and covariance matrices many statistical methods for discriminant analysis do not adapt well or easily to situations where the number of variables is large, possibly even exceeding the number of cases in the training set. we explore a variety of methods for providing robust identiication of future samples in this situation. we develop a range of exible bayesian methods, and primarily a new hierarchical covariance compromise method, akin to regularized discriminant analysis. although the methods are much more widely applicable, the motivating problem was that of discriminating between groups of samples on the basis of their near infrared spectra. here the ability of the bayesian methods to take account of continuity of the spectra may be beneecial. the spectra may consist of absorbances or reeectances at as many as 1000 wavelengths, and yet there may be only tens or hundreds of training samples where both sample spectrum and group identity are known. such problems arise in the food and pharmaceutical industries, for example the authentication of food (eg. detecting the adulteration of orange juice) and the identiication of pharmaceutical drug ingredients. our illustrating example concerns the discrimination of 39 microbiological taxa and 8 aggregate genera. simulations also illustrate the eeectiveness of the hierarchical bayes covariance method. we discuss a number of scoring rules both local and global for judging the t of data to the bayesian models, and adopt a cross-classiicatory approach for estimating hyperparameters.
high prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis but low sensitivity of symptom screening among hiv-infected pregnant women in south africa summary: tuberculosis (tb) is the preeminent manifestation of hiv infection and has become a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity in high hiv-prevalence settings. active tb in pregnant women has potentially serious consequences for fetuses and newborns. in soweto, south africa, there is a more than 90% uptake of voluntary counseling and hiv testing during routine antenatal care, and almost one third of pregnant women are hiv-infected. the posttest counseling session of the prevention of mother-to-child transmission program provides an opportunity to screen hiv-infected pregnant women for tb. in this study, 370 hiv-infected pregnant women were screened for symptoms of active tb by lay counselors at the posttest counseling session. if symptomatic, they were referred to nurses who investigated them further. eight women were found to have previously undiagnosed, smear-negative, culture-confirmed tb (2160/100,000). the mean cd4 count in those with active tb compared to those without tb was 276 × 106 cells per liter vs 447 × 106 cells per liter (p = 0.051). symptoms most associated with active tb were hemoptysis and fever. we conclude that rates of tb in hiv-infected pregnant women are high, and screening for tb during routine antenatal care should be implemented in high hiv-prevalence settings.
decreasing serum vlcfa levels in ageing x-ald female carriers significant losses of dna 5-methyldeoxycytidine residues in old age could disrupt cellular gene expression and contribute to the physiological decline of the animal. thus, the 5-methyldeoxycytidine content of dnas, isolated from the tissues of two rodent species of various ages, were determined. mus musculus lost dna methylation sites at a rate of about 4.7 x 10(4) (approximately 0.012% of the newborn level)/month. peromyscus leucopus lost dna 5-methyldeoxycytidine residues at a rate of only 2.3 x 10(4) (approximately 0.006% of the newborn level)/month. since p. leucopus generally live twice as long as m. musculus, the rate of loss of dna 5-methyldeoxycytidine residues appears to be inversely related to life span. similar losses in genomic 5-methyldeoxycytidine content were also observed to correlate with donor age in cultured normal human bronchial epithelial cells.
the kisspeptin-gnrh pathway in human reproductive health and disease we report the isolation of a cdna clone named gpr54, which encodes a novel g protein‐coupled receptor (gpcr). a pcr search of rat brain cdna retrieved a clone partially encoding a gpcr. in a library screening this clone was used to isolate a cdna with an open reading frame (orf) encoding a receptor of 396 amino acids long which shared significant identities in the transmembrane regions with rat galanin receptors galr1 (45%), galr3 (45%) and galr2 (44%). northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses revealed that gpr54 is expressed in brain regions (pons, midbrain, thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, cortex, frontal cortex, and striatum) as well as peripheral regions (liver and intestine). in cos cell expression of gpr54 no specific binding was observed for 125i‐galanin. a recent blast search with the rat gpr54 orf nucleotide sequence recovered the human orthologue of gpr54 in a 3.5 mb contig localized to chromosome 19p13.3.
sex determination in madagascar geckos of the genus paroedura (squamata: gekkonidae): are differentiated sex chromosomes indeed so evolutionary stable? recently, amphibians and reptiles have drawn attention because of declines in species and populations caused mainly by habitat loss, overexploitation and climate change. this study constructed a dna barcode database for the korean herpetofauna, including all the recorded amphibians and 68% of the recorded reptiles, to provide a useful, standardized tool for species identification in monitoring and management. a total of 103 individuals from 18 amphibian and 17 reptile species were used to generate barcode sequences using partial sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit i (coi) gene and to compare it with other suggested barcode loci. comparing 16s rrna, cytochrome b (cytb) and coi for amphibians and 12s rrna, cytb and coi for reptiles, our results revealed that coi is better than the other markers in terms of a high level of sequence variation without length variation and moderate amplification success. although the coi marker had no clear barcoding gap because of the high level of intraspecific variation, all of the analysed individuals from the same species clustered together in a neighbour‐joining tree. high intraspecific variation suggests the possibility of cryptic species. finally, using this database, confiscated snakes were identified as elaphe schrenckii, designated as endangered in korea and a food contaminant was identified as the lizard takydromus amurensis.
taurodeoxycholate modulates apical cl−/oh− exchange activity in caco2 cells the present studies were undertaken to examine the possible regulation of apical membrane cl-/oh- exchanger in caco-2 cells by protein kinase c (pkc). the effect of the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (pma), an in vitro pkc agonist, on oh- gradient-driven 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (dids)-sensitive 36cl uptake in caco-2 cells was assessed. the results demonstrated that pma decreased apical cl-/oh- exchanger activity via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3-kinase)-mediated activation of pkcepsilon. the data consistent with these conclusions are as follows: 1) short-term treatment of cells for 1-2 h with pma (100 nm) significantly decreased cl-/oh- exchange activity compared with control (4alpha-pma); 2) pretreatment of cells with specific pkc inhibitors chelerythrine chloride, calphostin c, and gf-109203x completely blocked the inhibition of cl-/oh- exchange activity by pma; 3) specific inhibitors for pkcepsilon (ro-318220) but not pkcalpha (go-6976) significantly blocked the pma-mediated inhibition; 4) specific pi3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and ly-294002 significantly attenuated the inhibitory effect of pma; and 5) pi3-kinase activators irs-1 peptide and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [pi(3,4,5)p(3)] mimicked the effects of pma. these findings provide the first evidence for pkcepsilon-mediated inhibition of cl-/oh- exchange activity in caco-2 cells and indicate the involvement of the pi3-kinase-mediated pathways in the regulation of cl- absorption in intestinal epithelial cells.
neural basis of reward anticipation and its genetic determinants a review of the existing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) studies on reward anticipation in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (adhd) is provided. meta-analysis showed a significant medium effect size (cohen's d=0.48-0.58) in terms of ventral-striatal (vs)-hyporesponsiveness in adhd. studies on vs-responsiveness and trait impulsivity in the healthy population demonstrate the opposite relationship, i.e. impulsivity-scores positively correlated with vs activation during reward processing. against the background that adhd may represent an extreme on a continuum of normal variability, the question arises as to how these contrasting findings can be integrated. we discuss three theoretical approaches, each of which integrates the opposing findings: (1) an inverted-u-shape model; (2) a (genetic) moderator model; and (3) the "unrelated model". we conclude that at the present stage the number of existing studies in the healthy population as well as in adhd groups is too small for a final answer. therefore, our presented integrative approaches should be understood as an attempt to frame future research directions by generating testable hypotheses and giving practical suggestions for future studies.
immune and acute phase response in pigs experimentally infected with h1n2 swine influenza virus. in the present study, acute phase proteins (app) responses in pigs after infection with toxigenic strain of pasteurella multocida (pm) were evaluated. twelve piglets from a herd free from toxigenic pm were used. six of them were infected intranasally with pm. crp, hp, saa and pig-map concentrations were measured using commercial elisa tests. crp and hp were significantly induced from 2 days post inoculation (dpi). the concentration of hp in inoculated pigs remained elevated until the end of the study. the concentrations of saa and pig-map increased significantly from 3 dpi, and remained elevated to 5 or 7 dpi, respectively. strong correlations were observed between concentration of hp or saa and changes in the lungs. no correlations were found between levels of app in serum and changes observed in the turbinates. on the basis of our investigation, we cannot state that evaluation of app concentrations in serum may provide useful information about severity of atrophic rhinitis. however, the concentration of all investigated app increased after inoculation. thus, app-measurements may reveal ongoing infection. monitoring of app concentrations in the pig herds may help to pinpoint infected animals even before clinical signs are present. if found, these "app-high" animals may be chosen next for pathogen-specific diagnostics. early diagnosis and therapy may prevent the infection from spreading in the herd. moreover, monitoring of app concentrations in serum may be useful for selecting clinically healthy pigs before integration into an uninfected herd. future studies should focus on the possibility of distinguishing infected and non-infected pigs under field conditions.
blind cfo estimation in ofdm systems using diagonality criterion this paper addresses the problem of joint channel and frequency offset estimation and tracking for ofdm systems. the proposed method is based on extended kalman filtering. the channel taps and the frequency offset are estimated in the time-domain while equalization is performed in the frequency domain. simulation results demonstrate accurate the tracking capability of the algorithm in scenarios when the channels are time-frequency selective. the frequency offset may be slowly or abruptly changing in time.
inhibition of regulated catecholamine secretion from pc12 cells by the ca2+/calmodulin kinase ii inhibitor kn-62. because synaptic vesicles and secretory granules are simple in composition and easy to purify, many of their protein components have been identified and often sequenced. attempts are underway to link the small number of membrane proteins to the small number of functions the vesicles perform. the discovery of sequence homologies has helped greatly with this. in addition, techniques that have begun to prove successful involve microinjection, identification of proteins that bind synaptic vesicle proteins, dna transfection into cells and oocytes, and more recently, in vitro reconstitution of exocytosis, endocytosis, and vesicle biogenesis. advances in the latter areas have been strongly influenced by the breakthroughs in our knowledge of membrane traffic in nonneuronal cells. the budding reactions involved in making synaptic vesicles and secretory granules resemble in many ways the generation of carrier vesicles from the er and the golgi complex. finally, exocytosis in neurons may closely resemble fusion of carrier vesicles with target organelles in nonneuronal cells, using complexes of peripheral membrane proteins, gtp hydrolysis, and integral membrane proteins with fusogenic domains. the usefulness of in vitro reconstitution, reverse genetics, and the parallels with better understood systems compensates in part for a major weakness in the field, namely the difficulty in obtaining viable mutants that are defective in the storage and release of secretory vesicle content.
catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation: an update. objectives the aim of this multicenter study was to evaluate the safety of discontinuing oral anticoagulation therapy (oat) after apparently successful pulmonary vein isolation.   background atrial fibrillation (af) is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events (te) and often requires oat. pulmonary vein isolation is considered an effective treatment for af.   methods we studied 3,355 patients, of whom 2,692 (79% male, mean age 57 +/- 11 years) discontinued oat 3 to 6 months after ablation (off-oat group) and 663 (70% male, mean age 59 +/- 11 years) remained on oat after this period (on-oat group). chads(2) (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age [75 years and older], diabetes mellitus, and a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack) risk scores of 1 and > or =2 were recorded in 723 (27%) and 347 (13%) off-oat group patients and in 261 (39%) and 247 (37%) on-oat group patients, respectively.   results during follow-up (mean 28 +/- 13 months vs. 24 +/- 15 months), 2 (0.07%) off-oat group patients and 3 (0.45%) on-oat group patients had an ischemic stroke (p = 0.06). no other thromboembolic events occurred. no off-oat group patient with a chads(2) risk score of > or =2 had an ischemic stroke. a major hemorrhage was observed in 1 (0.04%) off-oat group patient and 13 (2%) on-oat group patients (p < 0.0001).   conclusions in this nonrandomized study, the risk-benefit ratio favored the suspension of oat after successful af ablation even in patients at moderate-high risk of te. this conclusion needs to be confirmed by future large randomized trials.
let the tree bloom: scalable opportunistic routing with orpl traditionally, routing in wireless sensor networks consists of two steps: first, the routing protocol selects a next hop, and, second, the mac protocol waits for the intended destination to wake up and receive the data. this design makes it difficult to adapt to link dynamics and introduces delays while waiting for the next hop to wake up. in this paper we introduce orw, a practical opportunistic routing scheme for wireless sensor networks. in a duty-cycled setting, packets are addressed to sets of potential receivers and forwarded by the neighbor that wakes up first and successfully receives the packet. this reduces delay and energy consumption by utilizing all neighbors as potential forwarders. furthermore, this increases resilience to wireless link dynamics by exploiting spatial diversity. our results show that orw reduces radio duty-cycles on average by 50% (up to 90% on individual nodes) and delays by 30% to 90% when compared to the state of the art.
clinical and molecular characterization of turkish patients with familial hypomagnesaemia: novel mutations in trpm6 and cldn16 genes. magnesium plays an essential role in many biochemical and physiological processes. homeostasis of magnesium is tightly regulated and depends on the balance between intestinal absorption and renal excretion. during the last decades, various hereditary disorders of magnesium handling have been clinically characterized and genetic studies in affected individuals have led to the identification of some molecular components of cellular magnesium transport. in addition to these hereditary forms of magnesium deficiency, recent studies have revealed a high prevalence of latent hypomagnesemia in the general population. this finding is of special interest in view of the association between hypomagnesemia and common chronic diseases such as diabetes, coronary heart disease, hypertension, and asthma. however, valuable methods for the diagnosis of body and tissue magnesium deficiency are still lacking. this review focuses on clinical and genetic aspects of hereditary disorders of magnesium homeostasis. we will review primary defects of epithelial magnesium transport, disorders associated with defects in ca2+/ mg2+ sensing, as well as diseases characterized by renal salt wasting and hypokalemic alkalosis, with special emphasis on disturbed magnesium homeostasis.
transcript abundance, enzyme activity and metabolite concentration regulates differential carboxylate efflux in soybean under low phosphorus stress crop nutrition is frequently inadequate as a result of the expansion of cropping into marginal lands, elevated crop yields placing increasing demands on soil nutrient reserves, and environmental and economic concerns about applying fertilizers. plants exposed to nutrient deficiency activate a range of mechanisms that result in increased nutrient availability in the rhizosphere compared with the bulk soil. plants may change their root morphology, increase the affinity of nutrient transporters in the plasma membrane and exude organic compounds (carboxylates, phenolics, carbohydrates, enzymes, etc.) and protons. chemical changes in the rhizosphere result in altered abundance and composition of microbial communities. nutrient-efficient genotypes are adapted to environments with low nutrient availability. nutrient efficiency can be enhanced by targeted breeding through pyramiding efficiency mechanisms in a desirable genotype as well as by gene transfer and manipulation. rhizosphere microorganisms influence nutrient availability; adding beneficial microorganisms may result in enhanced availability of nutrients to crops. understanding the role of plant-microbe-soil interactions in governing nutrient availability in the rhizosphere will enhance the economic and environmental sustainability of crop production.
use of hf20 membrane in critically ill unstable low-body-weight infants on inotropic support background critically ill children with hemodynamic instability and acute kidney injury often develop fluid overload. continuous renal replacement therapy (crrt) has emerged as a favored modality in the management of such children. this study investigated the association between fluid overload and mortality in children receiving crrt.   study design prospective observational study.   setting & participants 297 children from 13 centers across the united states participating in the prospective pediatric crrt registry.   predictor fluid overload from intensive care unit (icu) admission to crrt initiation, defined as a percentage equal to (fluid in [l] - fluid out [l])/(icu admit weight [kg]) x 100%.   outcome & measurements the primary outcome was survival to pediatric icu discharge. data were collected regarding demographics, crrt parameters, underlying disease process, and severity of illness.   results 153 patients (51.5%) developed < 10% fluid overload, 51 patients (17.2%) developed 10%-20% fluid overload, and 93 patients (31.3%) developed > or = 20% fluid overload. patients who developed > or = 20% fluid overload at crrt initiation had significantly higher mortality (61/93; 65.6%) than those who had 10%-20% fluid overload (22/51; 43.1%) and those with < 10% fluid overload (45/153; 29.4%). the association between degree of fluid overload and mortality remained after adjusting for intergroup differences and severity of illness. the adjusted mortality or was 1.03 (95% ci, 1.01-1.05), suggesting a 3% increase in mortality for each 1% increase in severity of fluid overload. when fluid overload was dichotomized to > or = 20% and < 20%, patients with > or = 20% fluid overload had an adjusted mortality or of 8.5 (95% ci, 2.8-25.7).   limitations this was an observational study; interventions were not standardized. the relationship between fluid overload and mortality remains an association without definitive evidence of causality.   conclusions critically ill children who develop greater fluid overload before initiation of crrt experience higher mortality than those with less fluid overload. further goal-directed research is required to accurately define optimal fluid overload thresholds for initiation of crrt.
the role of g protein coupled receptor kinases in neurocardiovascular pathophysiology in the mammalian heart, cardiac function is under the control of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. all regions of the mammalian heart are innervated by parasympathetic (vagal) nerves, although the supraventricular tissues are more densely innervated than the ventricles. vagal activation causes stimulation of cardiac muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (m-chr) that modulate pacemaker activity via i(f) and i(k.ach), atrioventricular conduction, and directly (in atrium) or indirectly (in ventricles) force of contraction. however, the functional response elicited by m-chr-activation depends on species, age, anatomic structure investigated, and m-chr-agonist concentration used. among the five m-chr-subtypes m(2)-chr is the predominant isoform present in the mammalian heart, while in the coronary circulation m(3)-chr have been identified. in addition, evidence for a possible existence of an additional, not m(2)-chr in the heart has been presented. m-chr are subject to regulation by g-protein-coupled-receptor kinase. alterations of cardiac m(2)-chr in age and various kinds of disease are discussed.
artificial reefs for sea cucumber aquaculture confirmed as settlement substrates of the moon jellyfish aurelia coerulea jellyfish (cnidaria, scyphozoa) blooms appear to be increasing in both intensity and frequency in many coastal areas worldwide, due to multiple hypothesized anthropogenic stressors. here, we propose that the proliferation of artificial structures – associated with (1) the exponential growth in shipping, aquaculture, and other coastal industries, and (2) coastal protection (collectively, “ocean sprawl”) – provides habitat for jellyfish polyps and may be an important driver of the global increase in jellyfish blooms. however, the habitat of the benthic polyps that commonly result in coastal jellyfish blooms has remained elusive, limiting our understanding of the drivers of these blooms. support for the hypothesized role of ocean sprawl in promoting jellyfish blooms is provided by observations and experimental evidence demonstrating that jellyfish larvae settle in large numbers on artificial structures in coastal waters and develop into dense concentrations of jellyfish-producing polyps.
physiological and epigenetic analyses of brassica napus seed germination in response to salt stress proline (pro) accumulation is a common physiological response in many plants in response to a wide range of biotic and abiotic stresses. controversy has surrounded the possible role(s) of proline accumulation. in this review, knowledge on the regulation of pro metabolism during development and stress, results of genetic manipulation of pro metabolism and current debate on pro toxicity in plants are presented.
integrated stratigraphy of the paleocene‐eocene thermal maximum in the new jersey coastal plain: toward understanding the effects of global warming in a shelf environment publisher summary this chapter focuses on the paleoceanographical proxies based on deep-sea benthic foraminiferal assemblage characteristics, and presents the following three proxy relationships that are promising: those between benthic foraminiferal faunas and benthic ecosystem oxygenation, export productivity, and deep-sea water mass characteristics. under most circumstances the composition of deep-sea benthic foraminiferal assemblages is controlled by a rather limited number of environmental factors. the available proxies based on benthic foraminiferal assemblage composition show that they have major potential, but further research is needed to add or improve the quantitative aspects. in many cases, such as bottom water oxygenation, and corg flux to the ocean floor, it can be done by significantly increasing the size of existing databases. in other cases such as periodicity of the organic flux, time series observations are necessary. a major obstacle is insufficient knowledge of the differences between recent and fossil faunas due to taphonomical alterations. this phenomenon, of importance for all paleoceanographic proxies, can to some extent be solved relatively easily in the case of foraminiferal assemblages by detailed studies of their vertical succession in sediments deposited in the last 5,000 years, when environmental conditions were probably rather invariable in many areas. proxies based on foraminiferal assemblage composition are fundamentally different from all geochemical proxies, and thus may provide independent reconstructions of essential oceanographic parameters.
overexpression of deltafosb is associated with attenuated cocaine-induced suppression of saccharin intake in mice. objective to identify perinatal factors that are predictive of disruption in primary caregiving among infants of substance abusing women.   method a randomized longitudinal cohort study. one hundred and fifty two mother/infant dyads were assessed for evidence of disruption of primary caregiving or neglect during the first 18 months of life, defined by mother's inability to provide care. data analyzed included neonatal characteristics, urine toxicology at delivery, maternal history of drug use, maternal depression, social support, and social and health history.   results sixty-six infants (43.4%) had disruption in their primary care during the first 18 months of their life, 86 infants (56.6%) remained in the care of their mothers. women who were younger, were heroin users, had two or more children, had other children in foster care, and reported depressive symptoms were least likely to provide ongoing primary care for their infant.   conclusions although all infants born to substance abusing women are at a high risk for disruption in the continuity of their primary caregiving, maternal demographic and psychosocial factors present at delivery can predict which infants are likely to experience an early disruption in their primary caregiving. identifying these families can enable health care providers to monitor them more closely and, when appropriate, encourage support from the extended family.
targeting the akt/mtor pathway in brca1-deficient cancers extensive studies have demonstrated that the akt/akt1 pathway is essential for cell survival and inhibition of apoptosis; however, alterations of akt/akt1 in human primary tumors have not been well documented. in this report, significantly increased akt1 kinase activity was detected in primary carcinomas of prostate (16 of 30), breast (19 of 50), and ovary (11 of 28). the results were confirmed by western blot and immunohistochemical staining analyses with phospho-ser473 akt antibody. the majority of akt1-activated tumors are high grade and stage iii/lv (13 of 16 prostate, 15 of 19 breast, and 8 of 11 ovarian carcinomas). previous studies showed that wild-type akt1 was unable to transform nih3t3 cells. to demonstrate the biological significance of akt1 activation in human cancer, constitutively activated akt1 (myr-akt) was introduced into nih3t3 cells. overexpression of myr-akt in the stably transfected cells resulted in malignant phenotype, as determined by growth in soft agar and tumor formation in nude mice. these data indicate that akt1 kinase, which is frequently activated in human cancer, is a determinant in oncogenesis and a potential target for cancer intervention.
detail and gestalt focus in individuals with optimal outcomes from autism spectrum disorders this study explored the claim that individuals with autism and asperger's disorder tend to process locally rather than holistically. participants observed a large or "global" number composed of smaller or "local" numbers. the response was contingent upon the identification of either the large stimulus or the small stimuli. relative to age, sex, and iq matched controls, global processing in children and adolescents with autism (n = 12) and asperger's disorder (n = 12) was more vulnerable when the local stimuli were incongruent. the autism group made more global errors than their matched control group, regardless of whether there was local incongruence. in contrast, the asperger's disorder group made a similar number of global errors as their respective control group. these results were discussed in relation to an "absence of global precedence" notion, "weak central coherence" theory, and right-hemisphere dysfunction. the neurobiological significance of these findings were discussed in the context of a fronto-striatal model of dysfunction.
arabidopsis thaliana high-affinity phosphate transporters exhibit multiple levels of posttranslational regulation[c][w] functional genomic technologies are generating vast amounts of data describing the presence of transcripts or proteins in plant cells. together with classical genetics, these approaches broaden our understanding of the gene products required for specific responses. looking to the future, the focus of research must shift to the dynamic aspects of biology: molecular mechanisms of function and regulation. phosphorylation is a key regulatory factor in all aspects of plant biology; but it is difficult, if not impossible, for most researchers to identify in vivo phosphorylation sites within their proteins of interest. we have developed a large-scale strategy for the isolation of phosphopeptides and identification by mass spectrometry (nühse et al., 2003b). here, we describe the identification of more than 300 phosphorylation sites from arabidopsis thaliana plasma membrane proteins. these data will be a valuable resource for many fields of plant biology and overcome a major impediment to the elucidation of signal transduction pathways. we present an analysis of the characteristics of phosphorylation sites, their conservation among orthologs and paralogs, and the existence of putative motifs surrounding the sites. these analyses yield general principles for predicting other phosphorylation sites in plants and provide indications of specificity determinants for responsible kinases. in addition, more than 50 sites were mapped on receptor-like kinases and revealed an unexpected complexity of regulation. finally, the data also provide empirical evidence on the topology of transmembrane proteins. this information indicates that prediction programs incorrectly identified the cytosolic portion of the protein in 25% of the transmembrane proteins found in this study. all data are deposited in a new searchable database for plant phosphorylation sites maintained by plantsp (http://plantsp.sdsc.edu) that will be updated as the project expands to encompass additional tissues and organelles.
layer-specific interference with cholinergic signaling in the prefrontal cortex by smoking concentrations of nicotine adolescence is a critical period of brain development during which maturation of areas involved in cognitive functioning, such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mpfc), is still ongoing. tobacco smoking during this age can compromise the normal course of prefrontal development and lead to cognitive impairments in later life. recently, we reported that nicotine exposure during adolescence results in a short-term increase and lasting reduction in synaptic mglur2 levels in the rat mpfc, causing attention deficits during adulthood. it is unknown how changed synaptic mglur2 levels after adolescent nicotine exposure affect the ability of mpfc synapses to undergo long-term synaptic plasticity. here, we addressed this question. to model nicotine exposure, adolescent (p34–p43) or adult (p60–p69) rats were treated with nicotine injections three times per day for 10 d. we found that, both during acute activation of nicotinic receptors in the adolescent mpfc as well as immediately following nicotine treatment during adolescence, long-term plasticity in response to timed presynaptic and postsynaptic activity (tltp) was strongly reduced. in contrast, in the mpfc of adult rats 5 weeks after they received nicotine treatment during adolescence, but not during adulthood, tltp was increased. short- and long-term adaptation of mpfc synaptic plasticity after adolescent nicotine exposure could be explained by changed mglur2 signaling. blocking mglur2s augmented tltp, whereas activating mglur2s reduced tltp. our findings suggest neuronal mechanisms by which exposure to nicotine during adolescence alters the rules for spike timing-dependent plasticity in prefrontal networks that may explain the observed deficits in cognitive performance in later life.
techniques for shared resource management in systems with throughput processors our analysis shows that many "big-memory" server workloads, such as databases, in-memory caches, and graph analytics, pay a high cost for page-based virtual memory. they consume as much as 10% of execution cycles on tlb misses, even using large pages. on the other hand, we find that these workloads use read-write permission on most pages, are provisioned not to swap, and rarely benefit from the full flexibility of page-based virtual memory.  to remove the tlb miss overhead for big-memory workloads, we propose mapping part of a process's linear virtual address space with a direct segment, while page mapping the rest of the virtual address space. direct segments use minimal hardware---base, limit and offset registers per core---to map contiguous virtual memory regions directly to contiguous physical memory. they eliminate the possibility of tlb misses for key data structures such as database buffer pools and in-memory key-value stores. memory mapped by a direct segment may be converted back to paging when needed.  we prototype direct-segment software support for x86-64 in linux and emulate direct-segment hardware. for our workloads, direct segments eliminate almost all tlb misses and reduce the execution time wasted on tlb misses to less than 0.5%.
astrocyte-to-neuron communication through integrin-engaged thy-1/cbp/csk/src complex triggers neurite retraction via the rhoa/rock pathway. lateral associations between inactive αv integrin and thy-1 glycoprotein control integrin avidity to extracellular matrix ligand, the localization and kinetics of downstream signal activity, and mechanosensitive remodeling of the cytoskeleton.
tendon fascicles exhibit a linear correlation between poisson's ratio and force during uniaxial stress relaxation. a transversely isotropic biphasic mixture model was applied to tendon in uniaxial tension. parametric analyses were performed and the sensitivity in predicting material parameters was evaluated. our results provide quantitative evidence for fluid flow as a mechanism that contributes to tendon viscoelasticity. transversely isotropic material properties were calculated for mouse tail tendon fascicles. the average transverse modulus (e(1)) was 0.046 mpa, the fiber-aligned poisson's ratio (v(31)) was 2.73, and the transverse poisson's ratio [(v(21)) was 0.96; these properties were not strain-dependent. the fiber-aligned modulus (e(s)) was strain-dependent and was 20.7 mpa in the toe region and 86.1 mpa in the linear region. these solid matrix properties were consistent with previously published tendon tissue and fascicle data. the fascicle permeability was strain-dependent and was 5.5 x 10(-18)m(4)/ns in the toe region and 0.32 x 10(-18)m(4)/ns in the linear region, similar to previously reported meniscus permeability in tension. the similar permeabilities of both fascicle and tissue-level samples suggest that fluid flow from individual fascicles, not the packing of multiple fascicles together, may be the primary barrier to fluid flow in tendon and thus the primary mechanism for viscoelasticity.
the ecology of conception and pregnancy failure in wild baboons abstract we investigated the long-standing premise in behavioral ecology that the environment affects behavior and demography. we did this by evaluating the extent to which year-to-year variability in the behavioral ecology of a nonhuman primate population could be modeled from meteorological patterns. data on activity profiles and home range use for baboons (papio cynocephalus) in amboseli, kenya, were obtained over a 10-year period for three social groups: two completely wild-foraging ones, and a third that supplemented its diet with refuse from a nearby tourist lodge. the relationships across years among activity budgeting, travel distance, group size, and measures of temperature and rainfall patterns differed among the social groups. although meteorological variation generally correlated with behavioral variation in the completely wild-foraging groups, different weather variables and direction of relationships resulted for each group. in addition, different relationships among variables were found before and after home-range shifts. the food-enhanced group spent half as much time foraging as did the other groups and therefore could be used to evaluate the relative extent to which foraging time was a limiting factor for resting and social time. under their relaxed ecological conditions, the food-enhanced animals increased resting time much more than social time. these findings, combined with supplementary information on the population, lead us to suggest that baboons use a suite of interrelated responses to ecological variability that includes not only changes in activity budgets, but also home-range shifts, changes in the length of the active period, and changes in group size through fissions. moreover, our results imply that group differences as well as interpopulational and interspecific differences in behavioral ecology provide significant sources of variability. therefore, social groups rather than populations may be the appropriate unit of analysis for understanding the behavioral ecology of baboons and other highly social primates. the different patterns we observed among groups may have fitness consequences for the individuals in those groups and thereby affect population structure over time.
cep290 interacts with the centriolar satellite component pcm-1 and is required for rab8 localization to the primary cilium. bbs4 is one of several proteins that cause bardet-biedl syndrome (bbs), a multisystemic disorder of genetic and clinical complexity. here we show that bbs4 localizes to the centriolar satellites of centrosomes and basal bodies of primary cilia, where it functions as an adaptor of the p150glued subunit of the dynein transport machinery to recruit pcm1 (pericentriolar material 1 protein) and its associated cargo to the satellites. silencing of bbs4 induces pcm1 mislocalization and concomitant deanchoring of centrosomal microtubules, arrest in cell division and apoptotic cell death. expression of two truncated forms of bbs4 that are similar to those found in some individuals with bbs had a similar effect on pcm1 and microtubules. our findings indicate that defective targeting or anchoring of pericentriolar proteins and microtubule disorganization contribute to the bbs phenotype and provide new insights into possible causes of familial obesity, diabetes and retinal degeneration.
virtual reality and consciousness inference in dreaming the interrelationships between sleep, ecological, and constitutional variables were assessed statistically for 39 mammalian species. slow-wave sleep is negatively associated with a factor related to body size, which suggests that large amounts of this sleep phase are disadvantageous in large species. paradoxical sleep is associated with a factor related to predatory danger, which suggests that large amounts of this sleep phase are disadvantageous in prey species.
recognizing player goals in open-ended digital games with markov logic networks goal recognition for dialogue systems needs to be fast, make early predictions, and be portable. we present initial work which shows that using statistical, corpus-based methods to build goal recognizers may be a viable way to meet those needs. our goal recognizer is trained on data from apian corpus and then used to determine the agent's most likely goal based on that data. the algorithm is linear in the number of goals, and performs very well in terms of accuracy and early prediction. in addition, it is more easily portable to new domains as does not require a hand-crafted plan library.
genetics of channelopathies associated with sudden cardiac death purpose of review the sudden death of a previously healthy young individual is a dreadful occurrence. identifying those at risk of such a dire outcome, and appropriately managing and counseling them, has been an ongoing challenge, but rapid advances are being made. this review will focus on the long qt syndrome (lqts), the most common of the potentially lethal inheritable arrhythmias, with specific focus on the genetics relevant to clinical presentation, therapy and response. recent findings the past 2 decades have seen tremendous progress in the field of inheritable arrhythmias. emphasis is given to risk stratification, screening of family members, and the counseling of young athletes, as well as new developments in screening and treatment. summary for the primary care provider, long qt syndrome should be considered during the evaluation of syncope, near-syncope and seizures, especially in the setting of exercise or with a family history of sudden unexplained death in a first-degree relative. the corrected qt interval (qtc) should be assessed as a routine when obtaining electrocardiograms. if there are concerns on the basis of electrocardiogram findings, medical history or family history, referral to a cardiologist is indicated. providers need to be cognizant of the challenges of therapy and lifestyle changes for patients and families with long qt syndrome.
contribution of vesicular glutamate transporters to stress response and related psychopathologies: studies in vglut3 knockout mice abstract: gaba and glutamate play a major role in central integration of hypothalamo‐pituitary‐adrenocortical (hpa) stress responses. recent work in our group has focused on mechanisms whereby gabaergic and glutamatergic circuits interact with parvocellular paraventricular nucleus (pvn) neurons controlling the hpa axis. gabaergic neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, preoptic area, and hypothalamus can directly inhibit pvn outflow and thereby reduce acth secretion. in contrast, glutamate activates the hpa axis, presumably by way of hypothalamic and brainstem projections to the pvn. these inhibitory and excitatory pvn‐projecting neurons are controlled by descending information from limbic forebrain structures, including glutamatergic neurons of the ventral subiculum, prefrontal cortex, and gabaergic cells from the amygdala and perhaps septum. lesion studies indicate that the ventral subiculum and prefrontal cortex are involved in inhibition of hpa axis responses to psychogenic stimuli, whereas the amygdala is positioned to enhance hormone secretion by way of gaba‐gaba disinhibitory connections. thus, it seems the psychogenic responses to stress are gated by discrete sets of gabaergic neurons in the basal forebrain and hypothalamus. as such, these neurons are positioned to summate limbic inputs into net inhibitory tone on the pvn and may thus play a major role in hpa dysfunction seen in affective disease states and aging.
net: a new framework for the vectorization and examination of network data thinning is one of the most frequently used methods to obtain the geometrical features of objects. it also provides the topological feature and length measurements about an object. the paper presents a three dimensional thinning method which can control the quality of result concerning appearance of spurious short branches by a parameter value. this method is constructed by integrating the anchor point thinning algorithm and the skeletonization algorithm based upon the euclidean metric. we applied the proposed method to artificial figures and a three dimensional bronchus region extracted from a real chest x-ray ct image and confirmed that the proposed method could control the number of spike branches and shrinkage of branches.
core-shell-structured copolyaniline-coated polymeric nanoparticle suspension and its viscoelastic response under various electric fields this paper evaluates the use of electrorheological fluids (erfs) within a magnetic resonance imaging (mri) environment. erf is a semiactive variable impedance material, which could be used as an alternative type of resistive force/torque generation or in combination with other actuators as a damper/clutch to modulate the output force/torque of the actuator. in this paper, an erf damper/brake is introduced and its magnetic resonance (mr) compatibility is examined at a 3-t mr imaging environment by measuring the output performance of the damper and the snr of the mri images. the experimental results showed that damper's resistive force generation while positioned within the mri is almost the same as that in normal operation. the signal-to-noise investigation was performed both with a phantom and human. the results indicated that the erf damper did not affect the mri images when it was operated over 30 cm away from the mri's rf coil. we hope that the synthesis and tables presented in this paper can facilitate the choice of erf brake actuation principle to various applications in an mr environment.

interpretable convolutional neural networks detecting objects becomes difficult when we need to deal with large shape deformation, occlusion and low resolution. we propose a novel approach to i) handle large deformations and partial occlusions in animals (as examples of highly deformable objects), ii) describe them in terms of body parts, and iii) detect them when their body parts are hard to detect (e.g., animals depicted at low resolution). we represent the holistic object and body parts separately and use a fully connected model to arrange templates for the holistic object and body parts. our model automatically decouples the holistic object or body parts from the model when they are hard to detect. this enables us to represent a large number of holistic object and body part combinations to better deal with different "detectability" patterns caused by deformations, occlusion and/or low resolution. we apply our method to the six animal categories in the pascal voc dataset and show that our method significantly improves state-of-the-art (by 4.1% ap) and provides a richer representation for objects. during training we use annotations for body parts (e.g., head, torso, etc.), making use of a new dataset of fully annotated object parts for pascal voc 2010, which provides a mask for each part.
the mechanisms of detoxification of as(iii), dimethylarsinic acid (dma) and as(v) in the microalga chlorella vulgaris. the synthesis of phytochelatins (pcs) in a marine alga, dunalliela tertiolecta, is strongly induced by zn. pretreatment of the cells with zn enhances the tolerance toward toxic heavy metals such as cd, hg, cu, pb, and arsenate. moreover, the pretreatment also increases the tolerance toward oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide or paraquat. in vitro analysis shows that pc is a stronger scavenger of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radical than glutathione. these results suggest that pcs inducibly synthesized by zn treatment could play a role not only in detoxification of heavy metals but also in mitigation of oxidative stress.
prediction of ovarian cancer prognosis and response to chemotherapy by a serum-based multiparametric biomarker panel epithelial ovarian cancer constitutes one-quarter of the gynecologic malignancies, but is the leading cause of death among women with gynecologic cancer. in 6070% of the women, the disease is detected at a late stage when 5-year survival is poor. the recommended primary therapeutic approach for ovarian cancer is aggressive primarydebulking surgery followed by combination chemotherapy. the efficacy is routinely evaluated by repeated vaginal examination and transabdominal ultrasonography. however, these methods are unreliable for monitoring as progressive and recurrent disease often remains hidden until the patient presents with a large tumor mass. over the last few decades a variety of serological tumor markers has been proposed as a supplement to other non-invasive diagnostic methods. the main issue with tumor marker measurements is to obtain reliable information about changes in tumor mass before the changes are detectable by other methods. however, despite several attempts to identify useful serological markers for epithelial ovarian cancer, the results have not been as encouraging as for germ-cell tumors. the purpose of this paper is to review the applicability of ca 125, cea, tpa, tati, casa, and tetranectin in screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of ovarian carcinoma. several compounds other than those mentioned above are being investigated as markers in the early detection and management of ovarian cancer. some ofthese potential tumor markers listed in table 1 will not be discussed further in this review.
ion channel clustering enhances weak electric field detection by neutrophils: apparent roles of skf96365-sensitive cation channels and myeloperoxidase trafficking in cellular responses application of extremely low frequency pulsed dc electric fields that are frequency- and phase-matched with endogenous metabolic oscillations leads to greatly exaggerated neutrophil extension and metabolic resonance wherein oscillatory nad(p)h amplitudes are increased. in the presence of a resonant field, migrating cell length grows from 10 to approximately 40 microm, as does the overall length of microfilament assemblies. in contrast, cells stop locomotion and become spherical when exposed to phase-mismatched fields. although cellular effects were not found to be dependent on electrode type and buffer, they were sensitive to temporal constraints (phase and pulse length) and cell surface charge. we suggest an electromechanical coupling hypothesis wherein applied electric fields and cytoskeletal polymerization forces act together to overcome the surface/cortical tension of neutrophils, thus promoting net cytoskeletal assembly and heightened metabolic amplitudes. metabolic resonance enhances reactive oxygen metabolic production by neutrophils. furthermore, cellular dna damage was observed after prolonged metabolic resonance using both single cell gel electrophoresis ('comet' assay) and 3'-oh dna labeling using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. these results provide insights into transmembrane signal processing and cell interactions with weak electric fields.
roles for substance p and gastrin-releasing peptide as neurotransmitters released by primary afferent pruriceptors. the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating histamine-independent itch in primary sensory neurons are largely unknown. itch induced by chloroquine (cq) is a common side effect of this widely used antimalarial drug. here, we show that mrgprs, a family of g protein-coupled receptors expressed exclusively in peripheral sensory neurons, function as itch receptors. mice lacking a cluster of mrgpr genes display significant deficits in itch induced by cq but not histamine. cq directly excites sensory neurons in an mrgpr-dependent manner. cq specifically activates mouse mrgpra3 and human mrgprx1. loss- and gain-of-function studies demonstrate that mrgpra3 is required for cq responsiveness in mice. furthermore, mrgpra3-expressing neurons respond to histamine and coexpress gastrin-releasing peptide, a peptide involved in itch sensation, and mrgprc11. activation of these neurons with the mrgprc11-specific agonist bam8-22 induces itch in wild-type but not mutant mice. therefore, mrgprs may provide molecular access to itch-selective neurons and constitute novel targets for itch therapeutics.
kernel conditional exponential family in this paper, we consider an infinite dimensional exponential family, $\mathcal{p}$ of probability densities, which are parametrized by functions in a reproducing kernel hilbert space, $h$ and show it to be quite rich in the sense that a broad class of densities on $\mathbb{r}^d$ can be approximated arbitrarily well in kullback-leibler (kl) divergence by elements in $\mathcal{p}$. the main goal of the paper is to estimate an unknown density, $p_0$ through an element in $\mathcal{p}$. standard techniques like maximum likelihood estimation (mle) or pseudo mle (based on the method of sieves), which are based on minimizing the kl divergence between $p_0$ and $\mathcal{p}$, do not yield practically useful estimators because of their inability to efficiently handle the log-partition function. instead, we propose an estimator, $\hat{p}_n$ based on minimizing the \emph{fisher divergence}, $j(p_0\vert p)$ between $p_0$ and $p\in \mathcal{p}$, which involves solving a simple finite-dimensional linear system. when $p_0\in\mathcal{p}$, we show that the proposed estimator is consistent, and provide a convergence rate of $n^{-\min\left\{\frac{2}{3},\frac{2\beta+1}{2\beta+2}\right\}}$ in fisher divergence under the smoothness assumption that $\log p_0\in\mathcal{r}(c^\beta)$ for some $\beta\ge 0$, where $c$ is a certain hilbert-schmidt operator on $h$ and $\mathcal{r}(c^\beta)$ denotes the image of $c^\beta$. we also investigate the misspecified case of $p_0\notin\mathcal{p}$ and show that $j(p_0\vert\hat{p}_n)\rightarrow \inf_{p\in\mathcal{p}}j(p_0\vert p)$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$, and provide a rate for this convergence under a similar smoothness condition as above. through numerical simulations we demonstrate that the proposed estimator outperforms the non-parametric kernel density estimator, and that the advantage with the proposed estimator grows as $d$ increases.
global stability analysis of competitive neural networks with mixed time-varying delays and discontinuous neuron activations this paper introduces a general class of neural networks with arbitrary constant delays in the neuron interconnections, and neuron activations belonging to the set of discontinuous monotone increasing and (possibly) unbounded functions. the discontinuities in the activations are an ideal model of the situation where the gain of the neuron amplifiers is very high and tends to infinity, while the delay accounts for the finite switching speed of the neuron amplifiers, or the finite signal propagation speed. it is known that the delay in combination with high-gain nonlinearities is a particularly harmful source of potential instability. the goal of this paper is to single out a subclass of the considered discontinuous neural networks for which stability is instead insensitive to the presence of a delay. more precisely, conditions are given under which there is a unique equilibrium point of the neural network, which is globally exponentially stable for the states, with a known convergence rate. the conditions are easily testable and independent of the delay. moreover, global convergence in finite time of the state and output is investigated. in doing so, new interesting dynamical phenomena are highlighted with respect to the case without delay, which make the study of convergence in finite time significantly more difficult. the obtained results extend previous work on global stability of delayed neural networks with lipschitz continuous neuron activations, and neural networks with discontinuous neuron activations but without delays.
from bone abnormalities to mineral metabolism dysregulation in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (adpkd) is the most common genetic disease, affecting a half million americans. the clinical phenotype can result from at least two different gene defects. one gene that can cause adpkd has been located on the short arm of chromosome 16. this discovery has made possible new methods for diagnosing the disorder in gene carriers prior to the development of renal cysts. although renal cysts are clearly an important manifestation of the gene defect, other systemic manifestations are both common and clinically important. cardiac valvular lesions, intracranial aneurysms, hepatic cysts, and diverticula are included in the array of systemic manifestations. moreover, renal cysts are only one of a myriad of renal manifestations. although adpkd was long considered an adult cystic disease, it is also a common cause of childhood cystic disease and must be considered in the differential diagnosis in that setting.
0 time-varying discrete-time wavelet transforms time-varying filter banks and wavelets are studied and a design procedure is presented. in the resulting analysis-synthesis structures, the analysis filters and the corresponding synthesis filters, the number of bands, and the decimation rates can be changed with time. such structures can be considered as time-frequency overlapping block transforms. from this viewpoint, the tiling of the time-frequency plane and the corresponding basis functions are changed in time. the time-varying discrete wavelet transforms can be considered a special case of time-varying overlapping block transforms and are studied in detail. the formulation is based on the time domain formulation of time-varying analysis-synthesis structures. the design procedure can be used to design time-varying perfectly invertible transformations with a finite number of distinct analysis structures. for adaptive filter bank application, a least squares design method is also studied. >

bacteriophages and their immunological applications against infectious threats rna-binding proteins are central to posttranscriptional gene regulation and play an important role in a number of major human diseases. cloning such proteins is a crucial but often difficult step in elucidating the biological function of rna regulatory elements. to make it easier to clone proteins that specifically bind rna elements of interest, we have developed a rapid and broadly applicable in vitro genetic selection method based on t7 phage display. using hairpin ii of u1 small nuclear rna (u1hpii) or the 3′ stem loop of histone mrna as bait, we could selectively amplify t7 phage that display either the spliceosomal protein u1a or the histone stem loop-binding protein from a lung cdna phage library containing more than 107 independent clones. the use of u1hpii mutants with various affinities for u1a revealed that this method allows the selection even of proteins that bind their cognate rna targets with relatively weak affinities (kd as high as the micromolar range). experiments with a mixture of recombinant phage displaying u1a or the closely related protein u2b" demonstrated that addition of a competitor rna can suppress selection of a protein with a higher affinity for a given rna target, thereby allowing the preferential amplification of a lower affinity protein. together, these findings suggest that t7 phage display can be used to rapidly and selectively clone virtually any protein that binds a known rna regulatory element, including those that bind with low affinity or that must compete for binding with other proteins.
an integrated theory of language production and comprehension a number of internal model concepts are now widespread in neuroscience and cognitive science. these concepts are supported by behavioral, neurophysiological, and imaging data; furthermore, these models have had their structures and functions revealed by such data. in particular, a specific theory on inverse dynamics model learning is directly supported by unit recordings from cerebellar purkinje cells. multiple paired forward inverse models describing how diverse objects and environments can be controlled and learned separately have recently been proposed. the 'minimum variance model' is another major recent advance in the computational theory of motor control. this model integrates two furiously disputed approaches on trajectory planning, strongly suggesting that both kinematic and dynamic internal models are utilized in movement planning and control.
factors associated with geographic variation in cost per episode of care for three medical conditions increased area-level medical spending is not correlated with improved patient outcomes or quality, thereby supporting the case for spending reductions in high-spending regions. however, all additional spending need not be wasteful. examining the care of patients with colorectal cancer, we show that high-spending regions are more likely than other regions to use recommended care but are also more likely to use discretionary and nonrecommended care, the latter of which has adverse outcomes for patients. our results show that instead of cutting spending, policies designed to target services to patients most likely to benefit could increase the value of medical spending.
cyberknife radiosurgery for the treatment of intraocular and periocular lymphoma. immunodysregulation appears to play a prominent role in the evolution of some lymphomas, as evidenced by the strong associations between congenital and acquired immunodeficiencies and lymphoid neoplasia, and abnormal ratios of helper t cells in lymphoid proliferations. lympho-proliferative diseases of the ocular adnexa encompass a spectrum of lesions that may present with similar clinical and radiological features. most primary lymphoid proliferations of the ocular adnexa consist of small lymphocytes of b-cell origin. employing morphological, immunohistochemical, and molecular genetic criteria, proliferations may be separated into polyclonal and monoclonal categories. increased insight into the biology and behavior of these tumors tells us that seemingly benign, as well as frankly malignant proliferations, might disseminate to nodal or extranodal sites. the diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disease of any type necessitates a complete workup for systemic lymphoma. major prognostic criteria for lymphomas are anatomical site, stage, and histological features. radiotherapy is employed for localized lymphoid proliferations, with chemotherapy recommended for disseminated disease. long-term follow-up with semiannual examination is recommended. a significant percentage of primary ocular adnexal lymphoid lesions are malt-type lymphomas, extranodal low-grade b-cell lymphomas usually associated with mucosal tissues or glandular epithelia. the pathogenesis of this lymphoma in orbital soft tissue, which normally is devoid of lymphoid tissue, lymphatic vessels, and epithelium, is unclear. malt-type lymphomas of the ocular adnexa follow an indolent course, with long periods between relapses, and are responsive to therapy. dissemination, when it occurs, preferentially affects other extranodal sites.
successful nonsurgical treatment of pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, pneumoperitoneum, pneumoretroperitoneum, and subcutaneous emphysema following ercp endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp)-related perforation occurs in 0.1-1.8% of patients after therapeutic ercp. it is a serious complication with a high mortality. however, little evidence exists in the medical literature and the optimal management remains unclear. this review aims to critically evaluate the optimal management of therapeutic ercp-related perforation.
no different sensitivity in terms of whole-body irradiation between normal and acatalasemic mice the stomach region of hypocatalasemic mice of both sexes was x‐irradiated once with a dose of 20 gy. thirteen months after the irradiation, 3 out of 13 (20%) males and 2 out of 9 (15%) females were observed to have developed signet ring cell carcinomas in the glandular stomach. this finding was statistically significant (p < 0.01 in males and p < 0.05 in females) compared to a total absence of similar tumors in the non‐irradiated controls. local invasion of malignant tumors into muscle and subserosal layers was observed, but no metastatic tumors were found in distant organs.
deletion of the eif2α kinase gcn2 fails to rescue the memory decline associated with alzheimer’s disease β-site app-cleaving enzyme 1 (bace1) initiates amyloid-β (aβ) generation and thus represents a prime therapeutic target in treating alzheimer's disease (ad). notably, increasing evidence indicates that bace1 levels become elevated in ad brains as disease progresses; however, it remains unclear how the bace1 upregulation may affect efficacies of therapeutic interventions including bace1-inhibiting approaches. here, we crossed heterozygous bace1 knockout mice with ad transgenic mice (5xfad model) and compared the abilities of partial bace1 reduction to rescue ad-like phenotypes at earlier (6-month-old) and advanced (15–18-month-old) stages of disease, which expressed normal (∼100%) and elevated (∼200%) levels of bace1, respectively. bace1+/− deletion rescued memory deficits as tested by the spontaneous alternation y-maze task in 5xfad mice at the earlier stage and prevented their septohippocampal cholinergic deficits associated with significant neuronal loss. importantly, bace1+/− deletion was no longer able to rescue memory deficits or cholinergic neurodegeneration in 5xfad mice at the advanced stage. moreover, bace1+/− deletion significantly reduced levels of aβ42 and the β-secretase-cleaved c-terminal fragment (c99) in 6-month-old 5xfad mouse brains, while these neurotoxic β-cleavage products dramatically elevated with age and were not affected by bace1+/− deletion in 15–18-month-old 5xfad brains. interestingly, although bace1+/− deletion lowered bace1 expression by ∼50% in 5xfad mice irrespective of age in concordance with the reduction in gene copy number, bace1 equivalent to wild-type controls remained in bace1+/−·5xfad mice at the advanced age. in accord, phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eif2α, an important mediator of bace1 elevation, was dramatically increased (∼9-fold) in 15–18-month-old 5xfad mice and remained highly upregulated (∼6-fold) in age-matched bace1+/−·5xfad mice. together, our results indicate that partial reduction of bace1 is not sufficient to block the phospho-eif2α-dependent bace1 elevation during the progression of ad, thus limiting its abilities to reduce cerebral aβ/c99 levels and rescue memory deficits and cholinergic neurodegeneration.
use of fiber and fuzz mutants to detect qtl for yield components, seed, and fiber traits of upland cotton a genetic linkage map of chromosome 6 was constructed by using 270 recombinant inbred lines originated from an upland cotton cross (yumian 1 × t586) f2 population. the genetic map included one morphological (t1) and 18 ssr loci, covering 96.2 cm with an average distance of 5.34 cm between two markers. based on composite interval mapping (cim), qtl(s) affecting lint percentage, fiber length, fiber length uniformity, fiber strength and spiny bollworm resistance (earias spp.) were identified in the t1 locus region on chromosome 6. the allele(s) originating from t586 of qtls controlling lint percentage increased the trait phenotypic value while the alleles originating from yumian 1 of qtls affecting fiber length, fiber length uniformity, fiber strength and spiny bollworm resistance increased the trait phenotypic value.
immunohistochemical aspects of anti‐microbial properties in goat submandibular glands summarythe present review is focused on the main achievements realized in the lysozyme research field since the meeting held in 1972 to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the discovery of this enzyme. despite of extensive structural, physico-chemical, crystallographic, genetic, immunological and evolutionary studies devoted to lysozymes, their biological role is still not exactly known.
tumor progression locus 2 in hepatocytes potentiates both liver and systemic metabolic disorders in mice ras pathway signaling plays a critical role in cell growth control and is often upregulated in human cancer. the raf kinases selectively interact with gtp-bound ras and are important effectors of ras signaling, functioning as the initiating kinases in the erk cascade. here, we identify a route for the phospho-inhibition of ras/raf/mek/erk pathway signaling that is mediated by the stress-activated jnk cascade. we find that key ras pathway components, the rasgef sos1 and the rafs, are phosphorylated on multiple s/tp sites in response to jnk activation and that the hyperphosphorylation of these sites renders the rafs and sos1 unresponsive to upstream signals. this phospho-regulatory circuit is engaged by cancer therapeutics, such as rigosertib and paclitaxel/taxol, that activate jnk through mitotic and oxidative stress as well as by physiological regulators of the jnk cascade and may function as a signaling checkpoint to suppress the ras pathway during conditions of cellular stress.
a set of regulatory genes co-expressed in embryonic human brain is implicated in disrupted speech development purpose:the goal of this study was to identify new candidate genes and genomic copy-number variations associated with a rare, severe, and persistent speech disorder termed childhood apraxia of speech. childhood apraxia of speech is the speech disorder segregating with a mutation in foxp2 in a multigenerational london pedigree widely studied for its role in the development of speech–language in humans.methods:a total of 24 participants who were suspected to have childhood apraxia of speech were assessed using a comprehensive protocol that samples speech in challenging contexts. all participants met clinical-research criteria for childhood apraxia of speech. array comparative genomic hybridization analyses were completed using a customized 385k nimblegen array (roche nimblegen, madison, wi) with increased coverage of genes and regions previously associated with childhood apraxia of speech.results:a total of 16 copy-number variations with potential consequences for speech–language development were detected in 12 or half of the 24 participants. the copy-number variations occurred on 10 chromosomes, 3 of which had two to four candidate regions. several participants were identified with copy-number variations in two to three regions. in addition, one participant had a heterozygous foxp2 mutation and a copy-number variation on chromosome 2, and one participant had a 16p11.2 microdeletion and copy-number variations on chromosomes 13 and 14.conclusion:findings support the likelihood of heterogeneous genomic pathways associated with childhood apraxia of speech.genet med 2012:14(11):928–936
reciprocal regulation of microrna-99a and insulin-like growth factor i receptor signaling in oral squamous cell carcinoma cells background: microrna-99a markedly decreases in hcc. results: microrna-99a expression correlates with hcc patients' survival, and microrna-99a restoration suppresses hcc growth in vitro and in vivo by targeting igf-1r and mtor. conclusions: microrna-99a could be prognosis predictor and tumor suppressor for hcc. significance: reveal the important role of microrna-99a in hcc development and provide prognosis predictor and therapeutic approach for hcc. in our in-depth analysis carried out by the illumina solexa massive parallel signature sequencing, microrna-99a (mir-99a) was found to be the sixth abundant microrna in the mirnome of normal human liver but was markedly down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). compelling evidence has suggested the important roles of micrornas in hcc development. however, the biological function of mir-99a deregulation in hcc remains unknown. in this study, we found that mir-99a was remarkably decreased in hcc tissues and cell lines. importantly, lower mir-99a expression in hcc tissues significantly correlated with shorter survival of hcc patients, and mir-99a was identified to be an independent predictor for the prognosis of hcc patients. furthermore, restoration of mir-99a dramatically suppressed hcc cell growth in vitro by inducing the g1 phase cell cycle arrest. intratumoral injection of cholesterol-conjugated mir-99a mimics significantly inhibited tumor growth and reduced the α-fetoprotein level in hcc-bearing nude mice. insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (igf-1r) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) were further characterized as the direct targets of mir-99a. furthermore, protein levels of igf-1r and mtor were found to be inversely correlated with mir-99a expression in hcc tissues. mir-99a mimics inhibited igf-1r and mtor pathways and subsequently suppressed expression of cell cycle-related proteins, including cyclin d1 in hcc cells. conclusively, mir-99a expression was frequently down-regulated in hcc tissues and correlates with the prognosis of hcc patients, thus proposing mir-99a as a prospective prognosis predictor of hcc. mir-99a suppresses hcc growth by inducing cell cycle arrest, suggesting mir-99a as potential tumor suppressor for hcc therapeutics.
three-dimensional spectral-domain optical coherence tomography images of the retina in the presence of epiretinal membranes. purpose to evaluate the usefulness of optical coherence tomography (oct) images for surgical indication, intraoperative management and postoperative outcome of patients with idiopathic epiretinal macular membrane (iemm). methods 28 selected eyes underwent surgery for removal of iemm. the patients' mean age was 57.3 years. the macular region and the iemms were studied before and after surgery using oct, slit-lamp biomicroscopy and fundus photography. the mean postoperative follow-up was 6.2 months (range 1.3–14). results preoperatively, in 12 of the 28 eyes (42.9%) only the oct images revealed iemm partially separated from the macula, with tractional focal point(s) of attachment to the macular region. in the other 16 eyes (57.1%) in which iemms were totally adherent to the macular region, the membranes were barely visible by oct in 13 eyes and not visible in three. intraoperatively, the surgeon was guided in the peeling procedures. a significant correlation (p < 0.001) was found between visual acuity and macular thickness before surgery and at the end of the postoperative follow-up. conclusions oct images provide very useful information for the surgical indication, intraoperative management and postoperative outcome of patients with iemm.
mcl-1 regulates effector and memory cd8 t-cell differentiation during acute viral infection. regulated apoptosis is essential for both the development and the subsequent maintenance of the immune system. interleukins, including il-2, il-4, il-7 and il-15, heavily influence lymphocyte survival during the vulnerable stages of vdj rearrangement and later in ensuring cellular homeostasis, but the genes specifically responsible for the development and maintenance of lymphocytes have not been identified. the antiapoptotic protein mcl-1 is an attractive candidate, as it is highly regulated, appears to enhance short-term survival and functions at an apical step in genotoxic deaths. however, mcl-1 deficiency results in peri-implantation lethality. here we show that mice conditional for mcl-1 display a profound reduction in b and t lymphocytes when mcl-1 is removed. deletion of mcl-1 during early lymphocyte differentiation increased apoptosis and arrested the development at pro-b-cell and double-negative t-cell stages. induced deletion of mcl-1 in peripheral b- and t-cell populations resulted in their rapid loss. moreover, il-7 both induced and required mcl-1 to mediate lymphocyte survival. thus, mcl-1, which selectively inhibits the proapoptotic protein bim, is essential both early in lymphoid development and later on in the maintenance of mature lymphocytes.
monetary policy delegation and equilibrium coordination why is it that inflation is persistently high in some periods and persistently low in other periods? we argue that lack of commitment in monetary policy may bear a large part of the blame. we show that, in a standard equilibrium model, absence of commitment leads to multiple equilibria, or expectation traps. in these traps, expectations of high or low inflation lead the public to take defensive actions which then make it optimal for the monetary authority to validate those expectations. we find support in cross-country evidence for key implications of the model.
use of health information technology to advance evidence-based care: lessons from the va queri program objectives to document and assess the experiences of 104 agency for healthcare research and quality (ahrq)-funded health information technology (health it) grantees in planning and implementing health it systems.   data source grant proposals and interviews with the ahrq health it grantees.   data collection method extracted descriptive data from the health it grant proposals; conducted telephone interviews with principal investigators.   principal findings ahrq funding of the health it projects provided important support for health it development work in various health care settings. successful implementation required commitment from top management, dedicated staff and financial resources, an open process to encourage buy-in and enthusiasm by end users, and sheer persistence. technologies required tailoring to the specific organization's needs. grantees felt their projects could be replicated by others, if organizations had ample it expertise and resources. evaluating the value of health it was hampered by the absence of validated instruments and measures, organizational demands that competed with data collection, and lack of evaluation expertise among health it implementers.   conclusions experiences of the health it grantees provide rich information for use by health care providers, ahrq, and other policy makers to help strengthen future health it development efforts, including the need to improve evaluation design and standards to assess impact.
trans-splenic access for portal venous interventions in children: do benefits outweigh risks? purpose to present methods and results of interventional treatment of children with portal hypertension (ph) secondary to portal vein occlusion (pvo).   material and methods five children, four boys and one girl, 8 - 14 years old, with symptomatic ph secondary to pvo were treated. all children had one or more episodes of bleeding from oesophageal varices, enlarged spleen and thrombocytopenia. partial embolisation of the spleen was performed in four children. attempts to recanalize the occluded part of the portal vein were done in all children using transjugular (n = 4), transhepatic (n = 4) and transsplenic (n = 3) approaches.   results all procedures were carried out without serious complications and were followed by normalisation of the platelet count, decrease in splenic size and disappearance of bleeding. recanalisation of the occluded portal vein with a stent was possible in one child and partial stent recanalisation was possible in another child. transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (tips) with partly extrahepatic, intraperitoneal route was created in one patient. all children were scheduled for follow-up. during the observation time of 22 months (5 - 46 months), additional balloon dilation and placement of new stents were necessary in two children.   conclusion interventional procedures are valuable in the treatment of children with symptoms secondary to pvo. treatment should be customized and scheduled follow-ups of the patients are necessary.
can noninvasive brain stimulation enhance cognition in neuropsychiatric disorders? background the pathophysiology of depression may include synaptic hypoactivity of left prefrontal cortex. several groups of investigators have described improved mood associated with rapid transcranial magnetic stimulation (rtms) but have not looked for possible cognitive side effects associated with left prefrontal magnetic stimulation.   methods we measured the effects of left prefrontal rtms on mood, cognition, and motor evoked potential threshold in 10 patients with medication-resistant major depression.   results in a 2-week open trial of left prefrontal rtms off antidepressant medications, scores on the hamilton rating scale for depression and the beck depression inventory decreased by 41% and 40%, respectively. after resuming pre-rtms antidepressant medication, improvement in mood was still significant at 1 and 3 months later. rtms had no adverse effects on neuropsychological performance. rtms treatments were associated with significant decreases in motor evoked potential threshold in the 9 of 10 patients who remained off psychotropic medications during the 2-week treatment period.   conclusions these preliminary data suggest that left prefrontal rtms is safe and improves mood in patients with medication-resistant major depression. changes in motor evoked potential threshold suggest that prefrontal rtms may alter brain activity at sites remote from the stimulation. double-blind, sham-controlled studies are needed.
layer-specific interference with cholinergic signaling in the prefrontal cortex by smoking concentrations of nicotine adolescence is a critical period of brain development during which maturation of areas involved in cognitive functioning, such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mpfc), is still ongoing. tobacco smoking during this age can compromise the normal course of prefrontal development and lead to cognitive impairments in later life. recently, we reported that nicotine exposure during adolescence results in a short-term increase and lasting reduction in synaptic mglur2 levels in the rat mpfc, causing attention deficits during adulthood. it is unknown how changed synaptic mglur2 levels after adolescent nicotine exposure affect the ability of mpfc synapses to undergo long-term synaptic plasticity. here, we addressed this question. to model nicotine exposure, adolescent (p34–p43) or adult (p60–p69) rats were treated with nicotine injections three times per day for 10 d. we found that, both during acute activation of nicotinic receptors in the adolescent mpfc as well as immediately following nicotine treatment during adolescence, long-term plasticity in response to timed presynaptic and postsynaptic activity (tltp) was strongly reduced. in contrast, in the mpfc of adult rats 5 weeks after they received nicotine treatment during adolescence, but not during adulthood, tltp was increased. short- and long-term adaptation of mpfc synaptic plasticity after adolescent nicotine exposure could be explained by changed mglur2 signaling. blocking mglur2s augmented tltp, whereas activating mglur2s reduced tltp. our findings suggest neuronal mechanisms by which exposure to nicotine during adolescence alters the rules for spike timing-dependent plasticity in prefrontal networks that may explain the observed deficits in cognitive performance in later life.
multiple anti-interferon actions of the influenza a virus ns1 protein the nonstructural protein ns1 of influenza virus is an antagonist of host immune responses and is implicated in virulence. it has two domains, an n-terminal double-stranded rna–binding domain (rbd) and an effector domain crucial for rbd function, for nuclear export and for sequestering messenger rna–processing proteins. here we present the crystallographic structure of the effector domain, which has a novel fold and suggests mechanisms for increased virulence in h5n1 strains.
studying work practices: a key factor in understanding accidents on the level triggered by a balance disturbance the vast majority of the published workplace slips, trips and falls (stf) literature is exceedingly narrow in its focus and often ignores wider systems issues in workplace stf aetiology. there is little recognition within the published literature of the importance of latent failures or the upstream organisational and cultural contexts within which workplace stf occur. this is unfortunate, as a systems approach to workplace stf analysis, that is inclusive of latent design and work organisation factors that often shape worker behaviour patterns related to stf risk (e.g. rushing, risk taking), is fundamental to the development of effective prevention measures. the aims of this paper are to provide an understanding of workplace stf causation that is cognisant of the potential role of both active and latent failures in stf causation. the paper presents an ergonomics model for workplace stf analysis that highlights information processing in stf aetiology, the stf incident process and the interaction between latent and active failures in stf causation. the paper draws upon ergonomics research conducted in a range of occupational contexts to illustrate the key features of the model as it applies to workplace stf. implications of the model for analysis and prevention of stf are discussed.
maternal treatment with dexamethasone during gestation alters sexual development markers in the f1 and f2 male offspring of wistar rats. unlabelled we studied the effects of chronic renal failure on the pituitary-cortisol axis and adrenal androgen function in 26 patients (16 male and 10 female), aged 6.5 to 22.5 years (mean 14.5). ten patients were prepubertal, 8 pubertal, and 8 post-pubertal. all of them were on chronic hemodialysis. pubic hair development was delayed in 56% of the patients. serum cortisol was increased in 15 out of the 26 patients. serum delta 4-androstenedione was high in 11 out of 15 patients in tanner's stage i or ii and in 1 out of 11 patients in tanner's stage iii, iv or v (p less than 0.01). serum cortisol was elevated in 10 out of 12 patients with high serum delta 4-androstenedione and in only 5 out of 14 with normal delta 4-androstenedione (p less than 0.02). serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate was normal in 22 patients and elevated in 4 males. there was a significant inverse correlation between bone age and serum cortisol (r: -0.59; p less than 0.005) and a significant positive correlation between bone age and serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (r: 0.45 p less than 0.01). serum acth was normal. a reduction by 50% in cortisol and 78% in dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate was found after dexamethasone suppression, but delta 4-androstenedione did not suppress after dexamethasone. after acth stimulation test cortisol increased by 50% and delta 4-androstenedione by 80%.   conclusions the increased levels of cortisol and delta 4-androstenedione with partial resistance to dexamethasone suggest that these patients have a hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction similar to that found in cushing's disease or in chronic stress. the difference in the responses of delta 4-androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate observed is consistent with the existence of different mechanisms of control for these two steroids.
a new conservative-dynamic treatment for the acute ruptured achilles tendon background there is a lack of consensus regarding the best option for the treatment of acute achilles tendon rupture. treatment can be broadly classified as operative (open or percutaneous) or nonoperative (casting or functional bracing). postoperative splinting can be performed with a rigid cast (proximal or distal to the knee) or a more mobile functional brace. the aim of this meta-analysis was to identify and summarize the evidence from randomized, controlled trials on the effectiveness of different interventions for the treatment of acute achilles tendon ruptures.   methods we searched multiple databases (including embase, cinahl, and medline) as well as reference lists of articles and contacted authors. keywords included achilles tendon, rupture, and tendon injuries. three reviewers extracted data and independently assessed trial quality with use of a ten-item scale.   results twelve trials involving 800 patients were included. there was a variable level of methodological rigor and reporting of outcomes. open operative treatment was associated with a lower risk of rerupture compared with nonoperative treatment (relative risk, 0.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.11 to 0.64). however, it was associated with a higher risk of other complications, including infection, adhesions, and disturbed skin sensibility (relative risk, 10.60; 95% confidence interval, 4.82 to 23.28). percutaneous repair was associated with a lower complication rate compared with open operative repair (relative risk, 2.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.06 to 7.62). patients who had been managed with a functional brace postoperatively (allowing for early mobilization) had a lower complication rate compared with those who had been managed with a cast (relative risk, 1.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.27 to 2.76). because of the small number of patients involved, no definitive conclusions could be made regarding different nonoperative treatment regimens.   conclusions open operative treatment of acute achilles tendon ruptures significantly reduces the risk of rerupture compared with nonoperative treatment, but operative treatment is associated with a significantly higher risk of other complications. operative risks may be reduced by performing surgery percutaneously. postoperative splinting with use of a functional brace reduces the overall complication rate.   level of evidence therapeutic level i.
rheumatologic emergencies background: primary cns vasculitis (pcnsv) is an uncommon disease in which lesions are limited to the brain and spinal cord. our objective was to evaluate the frequency, clinical features, and outcome of spinal cord involvement in pcnsv. methods: we retrospectively identified 101 consecutive patients with pcnsv. spinal cord involvement was documented for five. clinical findings, laboratory studies, and outcomes of patients with spinal cord involvement were assessed and compared with those without spinal cord manifestations. results: spinal cord symptoms developed before cerebral symptoms in one patient, concurrently in two, and after cerebral symptoms in two. cns biopsy specimens showed necrotizing vasculitis in three patients and granulomatous vasculitis in two. mri of the spinal cord showed enhanced thoracic lesions in all five. cerebral angiograms from four patients had normal findings. one patient had a fatal clinical course. the other four had relapses during follow-up but responded well to therapy and had favorable overall outcomes. at the last follow-up (median, 19 months after diagnosis), the four patients had recovered with slight or moderate residual disability. no significant differences in clinical and laboratory features were observed when comparing patients with or without spinal cord involvement. cerebral angiograms with evidence of vasculitis were significantly more frequent for patients without spinal cord involvement (p = 0.002). conclusion: spinal cord involvement was documented in 5% of patients with primary cns vasculitis. the thoracic cord was the predominantly affected site. other than myelopathy, clinical characteristics were similar to those of the patients without spinal cord involvement. glossary: atm = acute transverse myelitis; esr = erythrocyte sedimentation rate; nd = no data; pcnsv = primary cns vasculitis; wbc = white blood cells.
artificial reefs for sea cucumber aquaculture confirmed as settlement substrates of the moon jellyfish aurelia coerulea jellyfish (cnidaria, scyphozoa) blooms appear to be increasing in both intensity and frequency in many coastal areas worldwide, due to multiple hypothesized anthropogenic stressors. here, we propose that the proliferation of artificial structures – associated with (1) the exponential growth in shipping, aquaculture, and other coastal industries, and (2) coastal protection (collectively, “ocean sprawl”) – provides habitat for jellyfish polyps and may be an important driver of the global increase in jellyfish blooms. however, the habitat of the benthic polyps that commonly result in coastal jellyfish blooms has remained elusive, limiting our understanding of the drivers of these blooms. support for the hypothesized role of ocean sprawl in promoting jellyfish blooms is provided by observations and experimental evidence demonstrating that jellyfish larvae settle in large numbers on artificial structures in coastal waters and develop into dense concentrations of jellyfish-producing polyps.
bar-sh3 sorting nexins are conserved interacting proteins of nervous wreck that organize synapses and promote neurotransmission in drosophila, the larval neuromuscular junction is particularly tractable for studying how synapses develop and function. in contrast to vertebrate central synapses, each presynaptic motor neuron and postsynaptic muscle cell is unique and identifiable, and the wiring circuit is invariant. thus, the full power of drosophila genetics can be brought to bear on a single, reproducibly identifiable, synaptic terminal. each individual neuromuscular junction encompasses hundreds of synaptic neurotransmitter release sites housed in a chain of synaptic boutons. recent advances have increased our understanding of the mechanisms that shape the development of both individual synapses--that is, the transmitter release sites including active zones and their apposed glutamate receptor clusters--and the whole synaptic terminal that connects a pre- and post-synaptic cell.
facet joint violation during pedicle screw insertion: a cadaveric study of the adult lumbosacral spine comparing the two pedicle screw insertion techniques twenty-one burst fractures of the thoracolumbar junction were stabilized with a transpedicular fixator by surgeons experienced in this technique. screws 5 or 6 mm in diameter were used. after the removal of the device 1 year postsurgery, axial ct scans were obtained of the instrumented vertebrae. eighty-two pedicles were examined. in 16 pedicles, medial or lateral cortical defects were found. five screws had intruded into the spinal canal by a maximum of 3.5 mm. in 48 pedicles a correlative comparison with the preoperative examinations was possible. compared with the dimensions of the pedicles on the preoperative ct scans, 31 had increased in width, and 14 showed deformation indicative of fractures of the lateral pedicle wall. when the screw diameter exceeded 65% of the pedicles' outer diameter, 85% of the pedicles expanded. one of four screws had penetrated the anterior wall of the vertebra. pedicle screw penetration on the left side above l2 poses potential risk of erosion of the aorta. the use of pedicle screws at the thoracolumbar junction by experienced surgeons carries some risk for malplacement and neurological damage. mismatch between pedicle dimension and screw size results in pedicle expansion and lateral wall fractures, probably during screw insertion. preoperative ct examinations should be used to help in choosing appropriate screw diameter presurgery.
chitosan nanoparticles enhance the antibacterial activity of chlorhexidine in collagen membranes used for periapical guided tissue regeneration. microorganisms and their by-products are considered to be the major cause of pulp and periradicular pathosis. hence, a major objective in root canal treatment is to disinfect the entire root canal system, which requires that all contents of the root canal system be eliminated as possible sources of infection. this goal may be accomplished using mechanical instrumentation and chemical irrigation, in conjunction with medication of the root canal system between treatment sessions. to reduce or eliminate bacteria, various irrigation solutions have been advocated. chlorhexidine is a cationic molecule, which can be used during treatment. it has a wide range of antimicrobial activity. its cationic structure provides a unique property named substantivity. the purpose of this paper is to review the structure and mechanism of action of chx, its antibacterial and antifungal activity, its effect on biofilm, its substantivity (residual antibacterial activity), its tissue solvent ability, its interaction with calcium hydroxide and sodium hypochlorite, its anticollagenolytic activity, its effect on coronal and apical leakage of bacteria, its toxicity and allergenicity and the modulating effect of dentine and root canal components on its antimicrobial activity. a medline search was performed from 1981 to the end of march 2008 and was limited to english-language papers. the keywords searched on medline were 'chlorhexidine and endodontics', 'chlorhexidine and root canal therapy', 'chlorhexidine and substantivity' and 'chlorhexidine and toxicity'. the reference lists of each article were manually checked for additional articles of relevance.
the effect of dietary fat intake on hepatic gene expression in lg/j and sm/j mice objective to examine the differential response of obesity- and diabetes-related traits to a high- or low-fat diet in lg/j and sm/j mice. we also examined food consumption in these strains.   research methods and procedures mice were placed on a high- or low-fat diet after weaning. animals were weighed once per week and subjected to glucose tolerance tests at 20 weeks. at sacrifice, fat pads and internal organs were removed along with serum samples. for food consumption, lg/j and sm/j mice of each sex were assigned to a high-fat or low-fat diet after reaching maturity. mice were weighed three times per week, and food consumed was determined by subtraction.   results lg/j animals consume more total food, but sm/j animals consume more food per gram of body weight. lg/j mice grow faster to 10 weeks but slower from 10 to 20 weeks, have higher cholesterol and free fatty acid levels, and have lower basal glucose levels and better response to a glucose challenge than sm/j mice. for most traits, sm/j mice respond more strongly to a high-fat diet than lg/j mice, including body weight and growth, basal glucose levels, organ weights, fat distribution, and circulating triglycerides and cholesterol levels.   discussion obesity-related phenotypes, as well as response to increased dietary fat, differ genetically between lg/j and sm/j and can, therefore, be mapped. this study indicates that the cross of sm/j and lg/j mice would be an excellent model system for the study of gene-by-diet interaction in obesity.
finite element modeling of short-wavelength folding on venus: implications for the plume hypothesis for crustal plateau formation crustal plateaus on venus constitute one of that planet’s most intriguing tectonic features. they host so-called “tessera” terrain, or deformed crust exhibiting two or more sets of intersecting tectonic lineaments, which comprises»8% of venus’ surface. major questions surrounding crustal plateaus and tessera terrain include: (1) what is the nature of crustal plateau deformation? what structures are present, and what are their spatial and temporal relations? (2) what is the global distribution of tessera terrain? does it form a global layer under the regional plains, cropping out in crustal plateaus, or is it confined to crustal plateaus? and (3) what are the implications of (1) and (2) for understanding the processes responsible for formation and deformation of crustal plateaus? structural and kinematic analyses reveal that deformation at ovda regio, venus largest crustal plateau, is characterized by linear shallow steep-sided troughs (ribbons), long arcuate long-wavelength folds, short mid-wavelength folds, and wide complex graben. temporal relations between structures lead to a three-phase regional strain history consisting of (1) layer-normal flattening of a thin competent membrane resulting in radially oriented, distributed extension (ribbon formation); (2) modest contraction of a thicker layer (concentric folding at plateau margins, interference folding in the plateau interior); and (3) limited extension localized at fold crests (graben formation). wavelength analysis of ribbons and folds places limits on the thickness of the competent layer during each stage of deformation and reflects an early shallow brittle‐ductile transition (bdt) that deepened with time. ovda’s deformation, topography, and gravity are all spatially correlated, strongly suggesting a genetic relationship between surface deformation and processes causing crustal thickening and plateau uplift. thus tessera terrain at ovda regio is likely confined to the topographically high plateau and does not extend beneath the surrounding regional plains. similar patterns persist at other crustal plateaus, indicating that tessera terrain is in general confined to crustal plateaus and does not form a globally continuous layer. ovda’s structures, their spatial and temporal relations, the resulting strain history, and the behavior of the bdt through time support a model of mantle plume upwelling in a thin lithospheric regime for crustal plateau formation and contradict previous downwelling models. similarities between structural and kinematic trends at ovda regio and other crustal plateaus lend support to this idea. c ∞ 1999 academic press
the dengue virus in nepal: gaps in diagnosis and surveillance dengue is a global health problem and expansion of its endemics towards new territories in the hilly regions in nepal is a serious concern. it appeared as a new disease in nepal in 2004 from japanese traveler with sporadic cases every year and massive outbreaks in 2010, 2013 and 2016. the serotype was responsible for outbreak in particular year was dengue virus serotype-1 (denv-1) in 2010, 2016; and denv-2 in 2013. nepal lacks basic health related infrastructure in rural areas and does not have a stringent health care policy. with severances of epidemic like dengue, a new surveillance or an upgrading of existing one are direly needed to better challenge the possible outbreaks. this review paper aims to explain the dengue trend in last one decade in nepal and warrants concerted and timely public health interventions to minimize the deleterious effects of the disease.
the c‐terminus of the kinase‐defective neuregulin receptor erbb‐3 confers mitogenic superiority and dictates endocytic routing four transmembrane tyrosine kinases constitute the erbb receptor family: the epidermal growth factor (egf) receptor, erbb-2, erbb-3, and erbb-4. we have measured the endocytic capacities of all four members of the egf receptor family, including erbb-3 and erbb-4, which have not been described previously. egf-responsive chimeric receptors containing the egf receptor extracellular domain and different erbb cytoplasmic domains (egfr/erbb) have been employed. the capacity of these growth factor-receptor complexes to mediate i-egf internalization, receptor down-regulation, receptor degradation, and receptor co-immunoprecipitation with ap-2 was assayed. in contrast to the egf receptor, all egfr/erbb receptors show impaired ligand-induced rapid internalization, down-regulation, degradation, and ap-2 association. also, we have analyzed the heregulin-responsive wild-type erbb-4 receptor, which does not mediate the rapid internalization of i-heregulin, demonstrates no heregulin-regulated receptor degradation, and fails to form association complexes with ap-2. despite the substantial differences in ligand-induced receptor trafficking between the egf and erbb-4 receptors, egf and heregulin have equivalent capacities to stimulate dna synthesis in quiescent cells. these results show that the ligand-dependent down-regulation mechanism of the egf receptor, surprisingly, is not a property of any other known erbb receptor family member. since endocytosis is thought to be an attenuation mechanism for growth factor-receptor complexes, these data imply that substantial differences in attenuation mechanisms exist within one family of structurally related receptors.
unsupervised detection of opium poppy fields in afghanistan from e0-1 hyperion data principal component analysis (pca) is one of the most commonly adopted feature reduction techniques in remote sensing image analysis. however, it may overlook subtle but useful information if applied directly to the analysis of hyperspectral data, especially for discriminating between different vegetation types. in order to accurately map an invasive plant species (horse tamarind, leucaena leucocephala) in southern taiwan using hyperion hyperspectral imagery, this study developed a spectrally segmented pca based on the spectral characteristics of vegetation over different wavelength regions. the developed algorithm can not only reduce the dimensionality of hyperspectral imagery but also extracts helpful information for differentiating more effectively the target plant species from other vegetation types. experiments conducted in this study demonstrated that the developed algorithm performs better than correlation‐based segmented principal component transformation (spct) and conventional pca (overall accuracy: 86%, 76%, 66%; kappa value: 0.81, 0.69, 0.57) in detecting the target plant species, as well as mapping other vegetation covers.
increased expression of bcl11b leads to chemoresistance accompanied by g1 accumulation kruppel-like factor 4 (klf4) belongs to a family of evolutionarily conserved zinc finger-containing transcription factors. it has been shown to mediate self renewal and pluripotency, regulate adipogenesis and play a critical role in monocyte differentiation. klf4 is also highly expressed in squamous cell carcinomas and in 70% of all primary human breast cancers, suggesting a putative role for klf4 as being an oncogene and as an antiapoptotic factor. however, the mechanism of this regulation remains unclear. here, we show that klf4 is induced during histone deacetylase inhibitor treatment, and regulates the extrinsic apoptosis pathway by inhibiting caspase cleavage. in addition, klf4 binds to the p57kip2 promoter and transcriptionally upregulates its expression, which in turn inhibits the stress activated protein kinase cascade and c-jun phosphorylation. our findings indicate that in cancer cells that express high levels of klf4 may be refractory to hdaci treatment. results of our study demonstrate an unexpected antiapoptotic function of klf4, and suggest an important cell fate determinant following histone deacetylase inhibitor induced apoptosis.
insect eggs suppress plant defence against chewing herbivores. plant-mediated interactions between pathogenic microorganisms and arthropod herbivores occur when arthropod infestation or pathogen infection changes the shared host plant in ways that affect a subsequent attacker of the opposite type. interest in such "tripartite" interactions has increased as the ecological and plant physiological framework for understanding and contextualizing them has developed. the outcomes of plant-mediated interactions are variable, and only a few provisional patterns can be identified at present. however, these interactions can have important consequences not only for individual pathogens and herbivores, but also for the population dynamics of both types of organisms in managed and natural ecosystems. research has focused on the role of two plant response pathways in mediating tripartite interactions, one involving jasmonic acid and the other salicylic acid. further studies of plant-mediated interactions will facilitate an understanding of how plants coordinate and integrate their defenses against multiple biotic threats.
specialization of binaural responses in ventral auditory cortices the acoustical cues for sound location are generated by spatial- and frequency-dependent filtering of propagating sound waves by the head and external ears. although rats have been a common model system for anatomy, physiology, and psychophysics of localization, there have been few studies of the acoustical cues available to rats. here, directional transfer functions (dtfs), the directional components of the head-related transfer functions, were measured in six adult rats. the cues to location were computed from the dtfs. in the frontal hemisphere, spectral notches were present for frequencies from approximately 16 to 30 khz; in general, the frequency corresponding to the notch increased with increases in source elevation and in azimuth toward the ipsilateral ear. the maximum high-frequency envelope-based interaural time differences (itds) were 130 mus, whereas low-frequency (<3.5 khz) fine-structure itds were 160 mus; both types of itds were larger than predicted from spherical head models. interaural level differences (ilds) strongly depended on location and frequency. maximum ilds were <10 db for frequencies <8 khz and were as large as 20-40 db for frequencies >20 khz. removal of the pinna eliminated the spectral notches, reduced the acoustic gain and ilds, altered the acoustical axis, and reduced the itds.
phosphoinositide binding by the snx27 ferm domain regulates its localization at the immune synapse of activated t-cells background: sorting nexin 27 regulates intracellular trafficking of proteins through the endosomal system. results: an interaction between snx27 and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor β-pix in complex with git family proteins is identified. conclusion: cells lacking snx27 have decreased cell motility, which we propose to be due to β-pix intracellular trafficking defects. significance: the results and model proposed have implications for recruitment/activation of p21-activated kinase (pak) or rho gtpases at focal adhesions. sorting nexin 27 (snx27) is a 62-kda protein localized to early endosomes and known to regulate the intracellular trafficking of ion channels and receptors. in addition to a px domain, snx27 is the only sorting family member that contains a pdz domain. to identify novel snx27-pdz binding partners, we performed a proteomic screen in mouse principal kidney cortical collecting duct cells using a gst-snx27 fusion construct as bait. we found that β-pix (p21-activated kinase-interactive exchange factor), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the rho family of small gtpases known to regulate cell motility directly interacted with snx27. the association of β-pix and snx27 is specific for β-pix isoforms terminating in the type-1 pdz binding motif (etnl). in the same screen we also identified git1/2 as a potential snx27 interacting protein. the interaction between snx27 and git1/2 is indirect and mediated by β-pix. furthermore, we show recruitment of the β-pix·git complex to endosomal sites in a snx27-dependent manner. finally, migration assays revealed that depletion of snx27 from hela and mouse principal kidney cortical collecting duct cells significantly decreases cell motility. we propose a model by which snx27 regulates trafficking of β-pix to focal adhesions and thereby influences cell motility.
influence of magnetic field strength and image registration strategy on voxel‐based morphometry in a study of alzheimer's disease structural imaging based on magnetic resonance is an integral part of the clinical assessment of patients with suspected alzheimer dementia. prospective data on the natural history of change in structural markers from preclinical to overt stages of alzheimer disease are radically changing how the disease is conceptualized, and will influence its future diagnosis and treatment. atrophy of medial temporal structures is now considered to be a valid diagnostic marker at the mild cognitive impairment stage. structural imaging is also included in diagnostic criteria for the most prevalent non-alzheimer dementias, reflecting its value in differential diagnosis. in addition, rates of whole-brain and hippocampal atrophy are sensitive markers of neurodegeneration, and are increasingly used as outcome measures in trials of potentially disease-modifying therapies. large multicenter studies are currently investigating the value of other imaging and nonimaging markers as adjuncts to clinical assessment in diagnosis and monitoring of progression. the utility of structural imaging and other markers will be increased by standardization of acquisition and analysis methods, and by development of robust algorithms for automated assessment.
quadratic regularization with cubic descent for unconstrained optimization ∗ in this work we propose a class of quasi-newton methods to minimize a twice differentiable function with lipschitz continuous hessian. these methods are based on the quadratic regularization of newton’s method, with algebraic explicit rules for computing the regularizing parameter. the convergence properties of this class of methods are analysed. we show that if the sequence generated by the algorithm converges then its limit point is stationary. we also establish local quadratic convergence in a neighborhood of a stationary point with positive definite hessian. encouraging numerical experiments are presented.
geochemical and microbial effects on the mobilization of arsenic in mine tailing soils adsorption-desorption of arsenic is the primary factor that impacts the bioavailability and mobility of arsenic in soils. to examine the characteristics of arsenate [as(v)] adsorption-desorption, kinetic batch experiments were carried out on three soils having different properties, followed by arsenic release using successive dilutions. adsorption of as(v) was highly nonlinear, with a freundlich reaction order n much less than 1 for olivier loam, sharkey clay, and windsor sand. adsorption of arsenate by all soils was strongly kinetic, where the rate of as(v) retention was rapid initially and was followed by gradual or somewhat slow retention behavior with increasing reaction time. freundlich distribution coefficients and langmuir adsorption maxima exhibited continued increase with reaction time for all soils. desorption of as(v) was hysteretic in nature and is an indication of lack of equilibrium retention and/or irreversible or slowly reversible processes. a sequential extraction procedure provided evidence that a significant amount of as(v) was irreversibly adsorbed on all soils. a multireaction model (mrm) with nonlinear equilibrium and kinetic sorption successfully described the adsorption kinetics of as(v) for olivier loam and windsor sand. the model was also capable of predicting as(v) desorption kinetics for both soils. however, for sharkey clay, which exhibited strongest affinity for arsenic, an additional irreversible reaction phase was required to predict as(v) desorption or release with time.
differential response of embryonic and fetal myoblasts to tgf beta: a possible regulatory mechanism of skeletal muscle histogenesis. northern blot hybridization experiments showed that apolipoprotein a-i (apo a-i) mrna is present at high concentration in chicken myotubes cultured in vitro, while it is virtually absent in fibroblasts and myoblasts. myotubes are also capable of translating and secreting in the culture medium a protein which is specifically immunoprecipitated by anti-apo a-i antibodies and has the same electrophoretic mobility as apo a-i purified from circulating high-density lipoproteins. the appearance of apo a-i mrna in myotubes depends on the transcriptional activation of the corresponding gene, as it was shown by hybridizing 32p-labeled rna synthesized in isolated nuclei to apo a-i cdna. the activation of the apo a-i gene is regulated by the muscle cell coordinately with muscle-specific genes. in fact, treatment with tpa, a powerful inhibitor of differentiation, efficiently prevents myoblasts from producing apo a-i mrna, as well as muscle actin mrna, and causes myotubes to quickly cease apo a-i mrna synthesis. the existence of a strict relationship between apo a-i mrna concentration and myogenic cell differentiation was also confirmed by experiments with quail myoblasts transformed with a temperature-sensitive mutant of the rous sarcoma virus. cells raised at the permissive temperature (undifferentiated phenotype) do not contain apo a-i as well as alpha-actin mrnas, while shifting to the nonpermissive temperature (differentiated phenotype) causes a rapid increase in apo a-i and alpha-actin mrna concentration.
west nile virus ecology in a tropical ecosystem in guatemala. objectives west nile virus (flavivirus: flaviviridae; wnv) has spread rapidly throughout the caribbean basin since its initial detection there in 2001. this report summarizes our current knowledge of wnv transmission in tropical america.   methods we reviewed the published literature and consulted with key public health officials to obtain unpublished data.   results west nile virus infections first appeared in human residents of the cayman islands and the florida keys in 2001, and in apparently healthy jamaican birds sampled early in 2002. serologic evidence of wnv infection in 2002 was detected in horses, chickens and resident free-ranging birds in guadeloupe, the dominican republic, and eastern mexico. in 2003, wnv spread in mexico and northern central america, and serologic evidence was detected in the bahamas, puerto rico and cuba. in 2004, the first serologic evidence of wnv activity in south american ecosystems surfaced in september-october in colombia and trinidad, where domestic animals circulated wnv-neutralizing antibodies.   conclusions the sparse reports of equine, human and avian disease in latin america and the caribbean is puzzling. isolates are needed to evaluate viral attenuation or other possible explanations for reduced disease burden in tropical ecosystems.
dendritic cell–activating vaccine adjuvants differ in the ability to elicit antitumor immunity due to an adjuvant-specific induction of immunosuppressive cells breast carcinomas are often infiltrated by inflammatory cells, particularly macrophages and t lymphocytes, but the significance of these cells remains unclear. one possible role of these inflammatory cells is that they represent a cell-mediated immune response against the carcinoma. cd8(+) lymphocytes are a known crucial component of cell-mediated immunity. the purpose of this study was to explore the prognostic value of tumor-infiltrating cd8(+) cytotoxic lymphocytes in breast cancer. tumor-infiltrating cd8(+) lymphocytes were assessed by immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarray cores from 1,334 unselected breast tumors from patients with long-term follow-up. the number of cd8(+) t cells was counted in tumor nests (intratumoral), in stroma adjacent to tumor cells, and in stroma distant to tumor cells, and their relationship with clinical outcome was determined. the total number of cd8(+) cells was positively correlated with tumor grade (r(s) = 0.20; p < .001) and inversely correlated with patient's age at diagnosis, estrogen receptor-alpha (er-α), and progesterone receptor (pgr) expression (mann-whitney u test, p < .001). the total patient cohort was randomly divided into two separate training and validation sets before performing univariate survival analysis. total number and distant stromal cd8(+) lymphocytes were associated with better patient survival (p = .041 and p < .001, respectively) in the training set. in multivariate analysis, total cd8(+) t-cell count was an independent prognostic factor in both training and validation sets. these results suggest that tumor-infiltrating cd8(+) t lymphocytes have antitumor activity as judged by their favorable effect on patients' survival and could potentially be exploited in the treatment of breast cancer.
clinical and molecular characterization of turkish patients with familial hypomagnesaemia: novel mutations in trpm6 and cldn16 genes. magnesium plays an essential role in many biochemical and physiological processes. homeostasis of magnesium is tightly regulated and depends on the balance between intestinal absorption and renal excretion. during the last decades, various hereditary disorders of magnesium handling have been clinically characterized and genetic studies in affected individuals have led to the identification of some molecular components of cellular magnesium transport. in addition to these hereditary forms of magnesium deficiency, recent studies have revealed a high prevalence of latent hypomagnesemia in the general population. this finding is of special interest in view of the association between hypomagnesemia and common chronic diseases such as diabetes, coronary heart disease, hypertension, and asthma. however, valuable methods for the diagnosis of body and tissue magnesium deficiency are still lacking. this review focuses on clinical and genetic aspects of hereditary disorders of magnesium homeostasis. we will review primary defects of epithelial magnesium transport, disorders associated with defects in ca2+/ mg2+ sensing, as well as diseases characterized by renal salt wasting and hypokalemic alkalosis, with special emphasis on disturbed magnesium homeostasis.
inhibition of semliki forest virus penetration by lysosomotropic weak bases. semliki forest virus was mixed with liposomes containing phosphatidylcholine,phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin, and cholesterol. when the ph of the mixture was dropped to 6 or below, rapid fusion between the membranes of the virus and the liposomes occurred, resulting in the transfer of viral nucleocapsids into the liposomes. fusion was demonstrated biochemically by trapping rnase or trypsin within the liposomes. trapped rnase digested the viral rna into acid-soluble form, providing a simple quantitative assay for fusion. trapped trypsin digested the viral capsid protein. fusion was also demonstrated by electron microscopy as the formation of large vesicles containing viral glycoproteins on the surface and nucleocapsids inside. the efficiency of fusion was 91 +/- 6%. in addition to low ph, it required that the viral glycoproteins be intact. in the target liposomes, cholesterol (but none of the individual phospholipids) was essential. divalent cations were not required. our previous studies with tissue culture cells indicated that the final step in the penetration of the semliki forest virus genome into host cells might involve a fusion event between the membrane of lysosomally trapped viruses and the lysosomal membrane [helenius, a., kartenbeck, j., simons, k. & fries, e. (1980) j. cell biol, 84, 404--420]. the data presented here are fully compatible with this hypothesis.
clinicalarticle authors bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia some macrolides have been found to exert anti-inflammatory effects. lung diseases such as asthma, panbronchiolitis, cystic fibrosis, and bronchiectasis are thought to respond to the immunomodulatory properties of macrolides. we report three cases of idiopathic bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, now called cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, and three cases of radiation-related bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia that responded to macrolide therapy. an explanation of why macrolides may have anti-inflammatory effects in patients with these syndromes is discussed. these cases help to reinforce accumulating data that macrolides are beneficial as anti-inflammatory agents and organizing pneumonia may be another pulmonary disease that can benefit from such therapy.
ptov1 is associated with uch-l1 and in response to estrogen stimuli during the mouse oocyte development abstract ptov1 is a mitogenic protein that shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in a cell cycle-dependent manner. it consists of two homologous domains arranged in tandem that constitute a new class of protein modules. we show here that ptov1 interacts with the lipid raft protein flotillin-1, with which it copurifies in detergent-insoluble floating fractions. flotillin-1 colocalized with ptov1 not only at the plasma membrane but, unexpectedly, also in the nucleus, as demonstrated by immunocytochemistry and subcellular fractionation of endogenous and exogenous flotillin-1. flotillin-1 entered the nucleus concomitant with ptov1, shortly before the initiation of the s phase. protein levels of ptov1 and flotillin-1 oscillated during the cell cycle, with a peak in s. depletion of ptov1 significantly inhibited nuclear localization of flotillin-1, whereas depletion of flotillin-1 did not affect nuclear localization of ptov1. depletion of either protein markedly inhibited cell proliferation under basal conditions. overexpression of ptov1 or flotillin-1 strongly induced proliferation, which required their localization to the nucleus, and was dependent on the reciprocal protein. these observations suggest that ptov1 assists flotillin-1 in its translocation to the nucleus and that both proteins are required for cell proliferation.
gnx-4728, a novel small molecule drug inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition, is therapeutic in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis alzheimer’s disease (ad), parkinson’s disease (pd) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) are the most common human adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases. they are characterized by prominent age-related neurodegeneration in selectively vulnerable neural systems. some forms of ad, pd, and als are inherited, and genes causing these diseases have been identified. nevertheless, the mechanisms of the neuronal cell death are unresolved. morphological, biochemical, genetic, as well as cell and animal model studies reveal that mitochondria could have roles in this neurodegeneration. the functions and properties of mitochondria might render subsets of selectively vulnerable neurons intrinsically susceptible to cellular aging and stress and overlying genetic variations, triggering neurodegeneration according to a cell death matrix theory. in ad, alterations in enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, oxidative damage, and mitochondrial binding of aβ and amyloid precursor protein have been reported. in pd, mutations in putative mitochondrial proteins have been identified and mitochondrial dna mutations have been found in neurons in the substantia nigra. in als, changes occur in mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes and mitochondrial cell death proteins. transgenic mouse models of human neurodegenerative disease are beginning to reveal possible principles governing the biology of selective neuronal vulnerability that implicate mitochondria and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. this review summarizes how mitochondrial pathobiology might contribute to neuronal death in ad, pd, and als and could serve as a target for drug therapy.
distinct muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes contribute to stability and growth, but not compensatory plasticity, of neuromuscular synapses terminal schwann cells overlying the neuromuscular junction sprout elaborate processes upon muscle denervation. we show here that motor axons use these processes as guides/substrates during regeneration; in so doing, they escape the confines of endplates and grow between endplates to generate polyneuronal innervation. we also show that schwann cells in the nerve provide similar guidance. axons extend from the cut end of a nerve in association with schwann cell processes and appear to navigate along them. the processes extend from axotomized nerves at the same rate and in the same manner as they do from axon-containing nerves. the rate of process extension limits the rate at which axons regenerate. thus, schwann cell processes lead and guide peripheral regeneration.
refined nmr structure of α-sarcin by 15n–1h residual dipolar couplings the main limitation in nmr-determined structures of nucleic acids and their complexes with proteins derives from the elongated, non-globular nature of physiologically important dna and rna molecules. since it is generally not possible to obtain long-range distance constraints between distinct regions of the structure, long-range properties such as bending or kinking at sites of protein recognition cannot be determined accurately nor precisely. here we show that use of residual dipolar couplings in the refinement of the structure of a protein–rna complex improves the definition of the long-range properties of the rna. these features are often an important aspect of molecular recognition and biological function; therefore, their improved definition is of significant value in rna structural biology.
ga3 content in young and mature antheridia of chara tomentosa estimated by capillary electrophoresis. summaryduring the development of the antheridia of chara species, dynamic changes in the occurrence and ultrastructure of plasmodesmata are observed which are closely correlated to particular developmental phases and presumably regulate the morphogenetic events in the antheridia. the disappearance of plasmodesmata between shield cells and between shied cells and the basal cell leads to a cessation in symplasmic transport around the antheridum and determines its concentric or centrifugal character via centrally situated capitular cells. unplugged plasmodesmata are present between fully synchronously developing antheridial filament cells and obviously coordinate the development of the cells. in the middle phase of spermiogenesis, rough endoplasmic reticulum in antheridial filaments passes uncompressed through wide plasmodesmata and provides an additional transport pathway for developmental control factors. plugged plasmodesmata link cells of different types or cells of the same type which are at different phases of cell cycle and guarantee their individual development. the plugging of plasmodesmata is a reversible process that depends on the morphogenetic situation. plasmodesmata connecting the basal cell and the subbasal cell as well as the basal cell and capitular cells are transformed successively from the simple into the complex type and might be the pathways for an import of gibberellins and nutrients into the strong sink tissues of the developing antheridium. there is a symplasmic connection between the antheridum and the thallus via a basal cell. prior to the initiation of spermatozoid differentiation (spermiogenesis), plasmodesmata connecting the basal cell with a subbasal cell and the basal cell with capitular cells are spontaneously broken, resulting in symplasmic isolation of the antheridium that is probably a signal which triggers the induction of spermatozoid differentiation. premature plasmolytically evoked symplasmic isolation of the antheridium leads to the elimination of 1 to 2 cell cycles from the proliferative stage of spermatogenesis. autoradiographic studies demonstrate that both natural and induced symplasmic isolation drastically decreases the entry of isotopically labeled gibberellic acid into antheridia of chara species that may be the consequence of the elimination of the hormone's transport through plasmodesmata.
answer set programming with templates standard belief contraction assumes an underlying logic containing full classical propositional logic, but there are good reasons for considering contraction in less expressive logics. in this paper we focus on horn logic. in addition to being of interest in its own right, our choice is motivated by the use of horn logic in several areas, including ontology reasoning in description logics. we consider three versions of contraction: entailment-based and inconsistency-based contraction (e-contraction and i-contraction, resp.), introduced by delgrande for horn logic, and package contraction (p-contraction), studied by fuhrmann and hansson for the classical case. we show that the standard basic form of contraction, partial meet, is too strong in the horn case. we define more appropriate notions of basic contraction for all three types above, and provide associated representation results in terms of postulates. our results stand in contrast to delgrande's conjectures that orderly maxichoice is the appropriate contraction for both e- and i-contraction. our interest in p-contraction stems from its relationship with an important reasoning task in ontological reasoning: repairing the subsumption hierarchy in el. this is closely related to p-contraction with sets of basic horn clauses (horn clauses of the form p → q). we show that this restricted version of p-contraction can also be represented as i-contraction.
the effect of compressed speech on the ability of right-hemisphere-damaged patients to use context the ability of right-brain-damaged (rbd) patients to use on-line contextual information in a word-monitoring task was examined. subjects were required to monitor for target words in the contexts of both normal and semantically anomalous sentences. similar to previous studies with normals (e.g., marslen-wilson & tyler, 1980), the semantic integrity of the context was influential in the word-recognition process. importantly, the rbd patients performed similarly to normals in showing context effects. these results were interpreted as substantiating the findings of leonard, waters, and caplan (1997a, 1997b) that rbd patients do not present with a specific deficit in the use of contextual information. the results are discussed in terms of proposals that suggest that an impaired ability to use contextual information by rbd patients may be a function of increased processing demands.
generalized likelihood ratio statistics and uncertainty adjustments in efficient adaptive design of clinical trials adaptive designs have been proposed for clinical trials in which the nuisance parameters or alternative of interest are unknown or likely to be misspecified before the trial. although most previous works on adaptive designs and mid-course sample size re-estimation have focused on two-stage or group-sequential designs in the normal case, we consider here a new approach that involves at most three stages and is developed in the general framework of multiparameter exponential families. this approach not only maintains the prescribed type i error probability but also provides a simple but asymptotically efficient sequential test whose finite-sample performance, measured in terms of the expected sample size and power functions, is shown to be comparable to the optimal sequential design, determined by dynamic programming, in the simplified normal mean case with known variance and prespecified alternative, and superior to the existing two-stage designs and also to adaptive group-sequential designs when the alternative or nuisance parameters are unknown or misspecified.
apolipoprotein d transgenic mice develop hepatic steatosis through activation of pparγ and fatty acid uptake acetyl-coa carboxylase, which has a molecular mass of 265 kda (acc-alpha), catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of long-chain fatty acids. in this study we report the complete amino acid sequence and unique features of an isoform of acc with a molecular mass of 275 kda (acc-beta), which is primarily expressed in heart and skeletal muscles. in these tissues, acc-beta may be involved in the regulation of fatty acid oxidation, rather than fatty acid biosynthesis. acc-beta contains an amino acid sequence at the n terminus which is about 200 amino acids long and may be uniquely related to the role of acc-beta in controlling carnitine palmitoyltransferase i activity and fatty acid oxidation by mitochondria. if we exclude this unique sequence at the n terminus the two forms of acc show about 75% amino acid identity. all of the known functional domains of acc are found in the homologous regions. human acc-beta cdna has an open reading frame of 7,343 bases, encoding a protein of 2,458 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 276,638 da. the mrna size of human acc-beta is approximately 10 kb and is primarily expressed in heart and skeletal muscle tissues, whereas acc-alpha mrna is detected in all tissues tested. a fragment of acc-beta cdna was expressed in escherichia coli and antibodies against the peptide were generated to establish that the cdna sequence that we cloned is that for acc-beta.
circadian rhythms of angiogenic factors in skin and wound tissue in per2-mutant mice in mammals, behavioral and physiological processes display 24-h rhythms that are regulated by a circadian system. in the present study, we investigated the possibility that the expression of clock genes in peripheral leukocytes can be used to assess the circadian clock system. we found that per1 and per2 exhibit circadian oscillations in mrna expression in mouse peripheral leukocytes. furthermore, the rhythms of per1 and per2 mrna expression in peripheral leukocytes are severely blunted in homozygous cry1/2 double-deficient mice that are known to have an abolished biological clock. we have examined the circadian expression of clock genes in human leukocytes and found that per1 mrna exhibits a robust circadian expression while per2 and bmal1 mrna showed weak rhythm. these observations suggest that monitoring per1 mrna expression in human leukocytes may be useful for investigating the function of the circadian system in physiological and pathophysiological states.
taurodeoxycholate modulates apical cl−/oh− exchange activity in caco2 cells the present studies were undertaken to examine the possible regulation of apical membrane cl-/oh- exchanger in caco-2 cells by protein kinase c (pkc). the effect of the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (pma), an in vitro pkc agonist, on oh- gradient-driven 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (dids)-sensitive 36cl uptake in caco-2 cells was assessed. the results demonstrated that pma decreased apical cl-/oh- exchanger activity via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3-kinase)-mediated activation of pkcepsilon. the data consistent with these conclusions are as follows: 1) short-term treatment of cells for 1-2 h with pma (100 nm) significantly decreased cl-/oh- exchange activity compared with control (4alpha-pma); 2) pretreatment of cells with specific pkc inhibitors chelerythrine chloride, calphostin c, and gf-109203x completely blocked the inhibition of cl-/oh- exchange activity by pma; 3) specific inhibitors for pkcepsilon (ro-318220) but not pkcalpha (go-6976) significantly blocked the pma-mediated inhibition; 4) specific pi3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and ly-294002 significantly attenuated the inhibitory effect of pma; and 5) pi3-kinase activators irs-1 peptide and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [pi(3,4,5)p(3)] mimicked the effects of pma. these findings provide the first evidence for pkcepsilon-mediated inhibition of cl-/oh- exchange activity in caco-2 cells and indicate the involvement of the pi3-kinase-mediated pathways in the regulation of cl- absorption in intestinal epithelial cells.
finite element modeling of short-wavelength folding on venus: implications for the plume hypothesis for crustal plateau formation crustal plateaus on venus constitute one of that planet’s most intriguing tectonic features. they host so-called “tessera” terrain, or deformed crust exhibiting two or more sets of intersecting tectonic lineaments, which comprises»8% of venus’ surface. major questions surrounding crustal plateaus and tessera terrain include: (1) what is the nature of crustal plateau deformation? what structures are present, and what are their spatial and temporal relations? (2) what is the global distribution of tessera terrain? does it form a global layer under the regional plains, cropping out in crustal plateaus, or is it confined to crustal plateaus? and (3) what are the implications of (1) and (2) for understanding the processes responsible for formation and deformation of crustal plateaus? structural and kinematic analyses reveal that deformation at ovda regio, venus largest crustal plateau, is characterized by linear shallow steep-sided troughs (ribbons), long arcuate long-wavelength folds, short mid-wavelength folds, and wide complex graben. temporal relations between structures lead to a three-phase regional strain history consisting of (1) layer-normal flattening of a thin competent membrane resulting in radially oriented, distributed extension (ribbon formation); (2) modest contraction of a thicker layer (concentric folding at plateau margins, interference folding in the plateau interior); and (3) limited extension localized at fold crests (graben formation). wavelength analysis of ribbons and folds places limits on the thickness of the competent layer during each stage of deformation and reflects an early shallow brittle‐ductile transition (bdt) that deepened with time. ovda’s deformation, topography, and gravity are all spatially correlated, strongly suggesting a genetic relationship between surface deformation and processes causing crustal thickening and plateau uplift. thus tessera terrain at ovda regio is likely confined to the topographically high plateau and does not extend beneath the surrounding regional plains. similar patterns persist at other crustal plateaus, indicating that tessera terrain is in general confined to crustal plateaus and does not form a globally continuous layer. ovda’s structures, their spatial and temporal relations, the resulting strain history, and the behavior of the bdt through time support a model of mantle plume upwelling in a thin lithospheric regime for crustal plateau formation and contradict previous downwelling models. similarities between structural and kinematic trends at ovda regio and other crustal plateaus lend support to this idea. c ∞ 1999 academic press
ion channel clustering enhances weak electric field detection by neutrophils: apparent roles of skf96365-sensitive cation channels and myeloperoxidase trafficking in cellular responses application of extremely low frequency pulsed dc electric fields that are frequency- and phase-matched with endogenous metabolic oscillations leads to greatly exaggerated neutrophil extension and metabolic resonance wherein oscillatory nad(p)h amplitudes are increased. in the presence of a resonant field, migrating cell length grows from 10 to approximately 40 microm, as does the overall length of microfilament assemblies. in contrast, cells stop locomotion and become spherical when exposed to phase-mismatched fields. although cellular effects were not found to be dependent on electrode type and buffer, they were sensitive to temporal constraints (phase and pulse length) and cell surface charge. we suggest an electromechanical coupling hypothesis wherein applied electric fields and cytoskeletal polymerization forces act together to overcome the surface/cortical tension of neutrophils, thus promoting net cytoskeletal assembly and heightened metabolic amplitudes. metabolic resonance enhances reactive oxygen metabolic production by neutrophils. furthermore, cellular dna damage was observed after prolonged metabolic resonance using both single cell gel electrophoresis ('comet' assay) and 3'-oh dna labeling using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. these results provide insights into transmembrane signal processing and cell interactions with weak electric fields.
predicting the transition from normal aging to alzheimer's disease: a statistical mechanistic evaluation of fdg-pet data our brain is a complex network in which information is continuously processed and transported between spatially distributed but functionally linked regions. recent studies have shown that the functional connections of the brain network are organized in a highly efficient small-world manner, indicating a high level of local neighborhood clustering, together with the existence of more long-distance connections that ensure a high level of global communication efficiency within the overall network. such an efficient network architecture of our functional brain raises the question of a possible association between how efficiently the regions of our brain are functionally connected and our level of intelligence. examining the overall organization of the brain network using graph analysis, we show a strong negative association between the normalized characteristic path length λ of the resting-state brain network and intelligence quotient (iq). this suggests that human intellectual performance is likely to be related to how efficiently our brain integrates information between multiple brain regions. most pronounced effects between normalized path length and iq were found in frontal and parietal regions. our findings indicate a strong positive association between the global efficiency of functional brain networks and intellectual performance.
chemical therapeutics identi fi cation and characterization of a small-molecule inhibitor of wnt signaling in glioblastoma cells glioblastoma multiforme is the most aggressive of the gliomas, a collection of tumors arising from glia or their precursors within the central nervous system. clinically, gliomas are divided into four grades; unfortunately, the most aggressive of these, grade 4 or glioblastoma multiforme (gbm), is also the most common in humans. because most patients with gbms die of their disease in less than a year and essentially none has long-term survival, these tumors have drawn significant attention; however, they have evaded increasingly cleaver and intricate attempts at therapy over the last half-century. the paper by gromeier et al. (1) in this issue of pnas is the newest chapter in this saga, describing a hybrid virus that infects and kills clonal human glioma cell lines, in culture and implanted in athymic mice, without affecting nonneoplastic cells within the brain. for those viewing this battle from a distance, the continued unsuccessful attempts at novel therapies for this disease may be difficult to understand. however, for those treating these patients, and certainly for the patients themselves, the importance and urgency of each attempt is clear.
the escherichia coli phosphotyrosine proteome relates to core pathways and virulence stringent starvation protein a (sspa) of escherichia coli is an rna polymerase-associated transcriptional activator for the lytic development of phage p1 and is essential for stationary phase-induced acid tolerance of e. coli. we report the crystal structure of yersinia pestis sspa, which is 83% identical to e. coli sspa in amino acid sequence and is functionally complementary in supporting the lytic growth of phage p1 and acid resistance of an e. coli sspa mutant. the structure reveals that sspa assumes the characteristic fold of glutathione s-transferase (gst). however, sspa lacks gst activity and does not bind glutathione. three regions of sspa are flexible, the n and c termini and the α2-helix. the structure also reveals a conserved surface-exposed pocket composed of residues from a loop between helices α3 and α4. the functional roles of these structural features were investigated by assessing the ability of deletion and site-directed mutants to confer acid resistance of e. coli and to activate transcription from a phage p1 late promoter, thereby supporting the lytic growth of phage p1. the results indicate that the flexible regions are not critical for sspa function, whereas the surface pocket is important for both transcriptional activation of the phage p1 late promoter and acid resistance of e. coli. the size, shape, and property of the pocket suggest that it mediates protein-protein interactions. sspa orthologs from y. pestis, vibrio cholerae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa are all functional in acid resistance of e. coli, whereas only y. pestis sspa supports phage p1 growth.
a three-dimensional (3d) organotypic microfluidic model for glioma stem cells - vascular interactions. metastatic cancer is regarded as one of the largest contributors to disease-related deaths worldwide. poor patient prognosis and treatment outcome is tied to the lack of efficacious anti-cancer therapies, which is due in part to the lack of physiologically relevant in vitro screening systems that can mimic the native tumor microenvironment. conventional drug-screening platforms, which are often used in the pharmaceutical industry, are either two-dimensional (2d) assays or three-dimensional (3d) hydrogel-based matrices that lack precise control over cell distribution, matrix architecture, and organization. despite the significance of in vivo models, they have limitations as it is difficult to control and analyze the influence of specific variables within their tumor microenvironment. thus, there is still a crucial need to develop tumor models that enable precise control of microenvironmental cues (e.g. matrix composition, soluble factors, cellular organization) to assess the efficacy of anti-cancer drugs. herein, we report the development and validation of a 3d microfluidic invasion platform for anti-cancer drug studies. our platform allowed for compartmentalization of tumor and stromal fibroblasts in a defined architecture, thereby enabling pharmacokinetic drug transport to a cell-dense tumor region. we analyzed the effect of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (saha), a histone deacetylase (hdac) inhibitor, on the behavior of sum159 breast cancer cells. many hdac inhibitors, including saha, have been a subject of controversy with highly conflicting results for the treatment of solid tumors in vitro as well as in clinical trials. we found that saha significantly inhibited cellular migration/proliferation, and decreased microtubule polarization.
a population-based analysis of behavior problems in children with cerebral palsy. a half-hour diagnostic psychiatric interview was described for use with 7- to 12-year-old children. four studies of reliability and validity were reported. inter-rater reliability was examined by having children interviewed by one psychiatrist while a second psychiatrist observed without taking part. at the end of the interview, without any discussion, both psychiatrists independently made separate ratings of the child's psychiatric state. re-test reliability was examined by having a further series of children interviewed twice, once by each author, with an interval of 1 to 30 days between the interviews. validity was tested by comparing the interview findings for a randomly selected sample of the general population and a sample of children judged to have psychiatric disorder on the basis of information from teachers and parents. the interviewing psychiatrist knew only the child's name and age and was unaware of the selection group from which the child was drawn.  a short psychiatric interview with a child was found to be a reasonably sensitive diagnostic instrument which could give rise to reliable and valid judgments on whether the child exhibited any psychiatric disorder. however, on the whole, individual ratings on specific aspects of behaviour proved to be less reliable than the overall psychiatric diagnosis. there were also marked differences in the reliability and usefulness of the various specific ratings.  depression proved to be a more difficult item than anxiety to rate reliably, but both were found to be reasonably efficient in the differentiation of the child with psychiatric disorder. the child's attention or persistence on cognitive tasks was also rated fairly reliably, and proved to be a surprisingly good indicator of psychiatric disorder. the child's emotional responsiveness at interview and the relationship he formed with the psychiatrist could be rated reliably, and these items also effectively differentiated children with psychiatric disorder from "control" children in the general population.  some of the inferences involved in the diagnostic process were examined in relation to the assessment of anxiety. it was shown, for example, that whereas fidgetiness is commonly taken to be an indicator of anxiety this assumption is frequently misleading. tension and tremulousness were also less useful indicators of anxiety than tearfulness, an anxious expression and preoccupation with anxiety topics at interview.  the main uses and limitations of the interview have been briefly discussed. it is concluded that the interview with the child (aged 7 to 12 years) forms a useful part of the diagnostic procedure in child psychiatry.
anatomical features associated with venous congestion in diep flap using ct angiography with three-dimensional reconstruction background: despite improving outcomes, venous problems in the harvest of deep inferior epigastric artery perforator (diep) flaps remain the more common vascular complications. however, it is apparent that the venous anatomy of the anterior abdominal wall has not been described to the same extent as the arterial anatomy. previous anatomical studies have focused on cadaveric anatomy or excisional specimens. the current study uses in vivo computed tomographic angiography to evaluate this anatomy, in combination with a cadaveric radiographic study. methods: both cadaveric and in vivo studies were undertaken using eight whole fresh cadaveric specimens (16 sides) and 100 patients undergoing diep flap breast reconstruction (200 sides). the cadaveric component used direct catheter venography and the in vivo studies were undertaken using preoperative computed tomographic angiography, mapping in vivo venous flow. results: the location, caliber, course, and distribution of the superficial and deep inferior epigastric veins were recorded. the dominance of each system and their direction of drainage were described. mechanisms for poor venous drainage were postulated, including perforator size, midline crossover of the superficial inferior epigastric vein, and the superficial and deep inferior epigastric vein communications. the incidence of each of these anatomical factors was evaluated. conclusion: the cause of venous compromise is multifactorial, with the current study showing that preoperative computed tomographic angiography may predict venous problems during flap harvest, by demonstrating perforator diameter, midline crossover, and deep-superficial venous communications.
dce-mri of the liver: reconstruction of the arterial input function using a low dose pre-bolus contrast injection detection, characterization, and monitoring the treatment of hepatocellular carcinomas (hcc) in patients with cirrhosis is challenging because of their variable and rapid arterial enhancement. multiphase dynamic contrast‐enhanced mri is used clinically for hcc assessment; however, the method suffers from limited temporal resolution and difficulty in coordinating imaging and breath‐hold timing within a narrow temporal window of interest. in this article, a volumetric, high‐spatial resolution, and high‐temporal resolution dynamic contrast‐enhanced liver imaging method for improved detection and characterization of hcc is demonstrated.
ifn-ε protects primary macrophages against hiv infection. glutathione (gsh), its derivatives and n-acetylcysteine (nac) inhibit the induction of hiv-1 expression in a chronically hiv-1-infected promonocytic cell line (u1/hiv) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc). we have examined the effects of gsh and nac on hiv-1 replication in human primary monocyte/macrophages cultured in vitro. ficoll-gradient purified human monocytes were cultivated in vitro for 7-10 days and then infected with hiv-1 (bal and ada-m). infection was blocked or substantially reduced by gsh or nac (5-20 mm). significant reduction (greater than or equal to 90%) in the amount of virus released, as determined by measuring supernatant reverse transcriptase activity and secreted p24 protein, was obtained when the cells were treated for 4 h with greater than or equal to 10 mm of gsh or nac. the inhibitory effects of gsh and nac were concentration dependent. this anti-hiv-1 effect persisted in these cultures for at least 35 days without evidence of significant increase in hiv-1 expression. thus, a single pulse exposure of hiv-1-infected monocyte/macrophages with gsh or nac led to a sustained, concentration-dependent decrease in hiv-1 p24 antigen levels, as well as, reverse transcriptase activity without producing detectable cellular toxicity in monocyte/macrophages.
hmm: a static mapping algorithm to map parallel applications on grids a major reason for the lack of practical use of parallel computers has been the absence of a suitable model of parallel computation. many existing models are either theoretical or are tied to a particular architecture. a more general model must be architecture independent, must realistically reflect execution costs, and must reduce the cognitive overhead of managing massive parallelism. a growing number of models meeting some of these goals have been suggested. we discuss their properties and relative strengths and weaknesses. we conclude that data parallelism is a style with much to commend it, and discuss the bird-meertens formalism as a coherent approach to data parallel programming.
implication of dna demethylation and bivalent histone modification for selective gene regulation in mouse primordial germ cells human ssx genes comprise a gene family with 6 known members. ssx1, 2 and 4 have been found to be involved in the t(x;18) translocation characteristically found in all synovial sarcomas. four (ssx1, 2, 4 and 5) are known to be expressed in a subset of tumors and testis, and anti‐ssx antibodies have been found in sera from cancer patients. ssx antigens are thus typical cancer‐testis (ct) antigens. to identify additional ssx family members, we isolated and characterized human genomic clones homologous to a prototype ssx cdna. we also searched public databases for sequences similar to ssx. this identified 3 additional ssx genes, ssx7, 8, 9, and also completed the sequence of the formerly partially defined ssx6 gene. in addition to these novel ssx genes, several ssx pseudogenes were identified. with the exception of 1 pseudogene, all ssx genomic ssx sequences map to chromosome x. among normal tissues, ssx7 mrna was present only in testis, whereas ssx6, 8 and 9 were not detected in any normal tissue. ssx6 and 7 were expressed in 1 of 9 melanoma cell lines tested, whereas ssx8 and 9 expression was not detected in any tumor tissue or cell lines tested. ssx1, 2, 4 and 5 mrna expression can be induced in cell lines by 5‐aza‐2‐deoxycytidine or trichostatin a. these agents also induce ssx6, but not ssx3, 7, 8 or 9 in the tumor cell lines tested, indicating that mechanisms other than methylation or histone acetylation may be responsible for the repressed state of some ssx genes. © 2002 wiley‐liss, inc.
tradeoffs between the axial resolution and the signal-to-noise ratio in elastography this paper presents a theoretical framework for performance characterization in strain estimation, which includes the effect of signal decorrelation, quantization errors due to the finite temporal sampling rate, and electronic noise. an upper bound on the performance of the strain estimator in elastography is obtained from a strain filter constructed using these limits. the strain filter is a term used to describe the nonlinear filtering process in the strain domain (due to the ultrasound system and signal processing parameters) that allows the elastographic depiction of a limited range of strains from the compressed tissue. the strain filter predicts the elastogram quality by specifying the elastographic signal-to-noise ratio (snr/sub e/), sensitivity, and the strain dynamic range at a given resolution. the dynamic range is limited by decorrelation errors for large tissue strain values, and electronic noise for low strain values. tradeoffs between different techniques used to enhance elastogram image quality may also be analyzed using the strain filter.
intradural prostate carcinoma metastatic lesion mimicking an exophytic ependymoma: case report the management of 10 patients with symptomatic localized intradural extramedullary spinal metastasis is reviewed. the single most common primary source was carcinoma of the breast (four cases). the initial symptom in nine patients was pain, with five patients reporting a characteristically severe cramping discomfort with radicular distribution. all patients underwent laminectomy decompression. at the time of surgery, six of the patients were weak but ambulatory and four were bedridden. following surgery, four patients enjoyed some measure of pain relief, seven patients became ambulatory, and three remained bedridden. two patients achieved a "satisfactory" result, and were walking and continent 6 months after surgery. secondary brain tumors were demonstrated or implicated in nine patients, supporting the concept that the spinal metastases represented tertiary deposits following dissemination via the cerebrospinal fluid. symptomatic intradural extramedullary spinal metastasis causes a virulent clinical syndrome with poor prognosis and disappointing outcome after treatment. given the high incidence of associated cerebral metastatic involvement, total neuraxis radiation and/or chemotherapy should be considered when symptomatic spinal metastasis is discovered to be intradural and extramedullary.
let the tree bloom: scalable opportunistic routing with orpl traditionally, routing in wireless sensor networks consists of two steps: first, the routing protocol selects a next hop, and, second, the mac protocol waits for the intended destination to wake up and receive the data. this design makes it difficult to adapt to link dynamics and introduces delays while waiting for the next hop to wake up. in this paper we introduce orw, a practical opportunistic routing scheme for wireless sensor networks. in a duty-cycled setting, packets are addressed to sets of potential receivers and forwarded by the neighbor that wakes up first and successfully receives the packet. this reduces delay and energy consumption by utilizing all neighbors as potential forwarders. furthermore, this increases resilience to wireless link dynamics by exploiting spatial diversity. our results show that orw reduces radio duty-cycles on average by 50% (up to 90% on individual nodes) and delays by 30% to 90% when compared to the state of the art.
arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities show low resistance and high resilience to wildfire disturbance invasions by non-native plants can alter ecosystem functions and reduce native plant diversity, but relatively little is known about their effect on belowground microbial communities. we show that invasions by knapweed (centaurea stoebe) and leafy spurge (euphorbia esula, hereafter spurge)—but not cheatgrass (bromus tectorum)—support a higher abundance and diversity of symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (amf) than multi-species native plant communities. the higher amf richness associated with knapweed and spurge is unlikely due to a co-invasion by amf, because a separate sampling showed that individual native forbs hosted a similar amf abundance and richness as exotic forbs. native grasses associated with fewer amf taxa, which could explain the reduced amf richness in native, grass-dominated communities. the three invasive plant species harbored distinct amf communities, and analyses of co-occurring native and invasive plants indicate that differences were partly driven by the invasive plants and were not the result of pre-invasion conditions. our results suggest that invasions by mycotrophic plants that replace poorer hosts can increase amf abundance and richness. the high amf richness in monodominant plant invasions also indicates that the proposed positive relationship between above and belowground diversity is not always strong. finally, the disparate responses among exotic plants and consistent results between grasses and forbs suggest that amf respond more to plant functional group than plant provenance.
face recognition using weber local descriptors information jointly contained in image space, scale and orientation domains can provide rich important clues not seen in either individual of these domains. the position, spatial frequency and orientation selectivity properties are believed to have an important role in visual perception. this paper proposes a novel face representation and recognition approach by exploring information jointly in image space, scale and orientation domains. specifically, the face image is first decomposed into different scale and orientation responses by convolving multiscale and multi-orientation gabor filters. second, local binary pattern analysis is used to describe the neighboring relationship not only in image space, but also in different scale and orientation responses. this way, information from different domains is explored to give a good face representation for recognition. discriminant classification is then performed based upon weighted histogram intersection or conditional mutual information with linear discriminant analysis techniques. extensive experimental results on feret, ar, and frgc ver 2.0 databases show the significant advantages of the proposed method over the existing ones.
temporomandibular disorders this prospective study was designed to establish how the positions of the molars and the condyles are related to incisor position in the mandibular rest position and how their positions are altered by changing head posture. measurements of the mandibular rest position were taken on 24 men (age range, 23 to 35) with normal class i occlusion, skeletal patterns, and temporomandibular joint function. the movements of 5 landmarks (lower incisor, and condyles and molars bilaterally) were tracked from maximum intercuspation into 4 independent rest positions (upright supported, upright unsupported, supine supported, and supine unsupported) using an optoelectric (optotrak; northern digital, waterloo, ontario, canada) computer system. the positions were based on minimal electromyographic and verbal instructions to swallow, lick the lips, and say "mississippi." the results showed significant (p <.01) movements of the incisors, the molars, and the condyles into each of the 4 rest positions. movements of the molars and the condyles into the supported upright posture and the unsupported upright posture differed slightly but significantly because of greater movement into the supported posture. patterns of mandibular movement were entirely different between the upright and the supine rest positions; the mandible rotated anteriorly in the supine position and posteriorly in the upright position. we concluded that movement into the mandibular rest position from the intercuspal position is not a simple opening rotation of the mandible, and that the pattern of movement is influenced by head support and body postures.
referential choices in a collaborative storytelling task: discourse stages and referential complexity matter in this study, children, young adults and elderly adults were tested in production and comprehension tasks assessing referential choice. our aims were (1) to determine whether speakers egocentrically base their referential choice on the preceding linguistic discourse or also take into account the perspective of a hypothetical listener and (2) whether the possible impact of perspective taking on referential choice changes with increasing age, with its associated changes in cognitive capacity. in the production task, participants described picture-based stories featuring two characters of the same gender, making it necessary to use unambiguous forms; in the comprehension task, participants interpreted potentially ambiguous pronouns at the end of similar orally presented stories. young adults (aged 18–35) were highly sensitive to the informational needs of hypothetical conversational partners in their production and comprehension of referring expressions. in contrast, children (aged 4–7) did not take into account possible conversational partners and tended to use pronouns for all given referents, leading to the production of ambiguous pronouns that are unrecoverable for a listener. this was mirrored in the outcome of the comprehension task, where children were insensitive to the shift of discourse topic marked by the speaker. the elderly adults (aged 69–87) behaved differently from both young adults and children. they showed a clear sensitivity to the other person's perspective in both production and comprehension, but appeared to lack the necessary cognitive capacities to keep track of the prominence of discourse referents, producing more potentially ambiguous pronouns than young adults, though fewer than children. in conclusion then, referential choice seems to depend on perspective taking in language, which develops with increasing linguistic experience and cognitive capacity, but also on the ability to keep track of the prominence of discourse referents, which is gradually lost with older age.

a method for extracting a high-quality rna from symbiodinium sp. backgroundthe integrity of rna molecules is of paramount importance for experiments that try to reflect the snapshot of gene expression at the moment of rna extraction. until recently, there has been no reliable standard for estimating the integrity of rna samples and the ratio of 28s:18s ribosomal rna, the common measure for this purpose, has been shown to be inconsistent. the advent of microcapillary electrophoretic rna separation provides the basis for an automated high-throughput approach, in order to estimate the integrity of rna samples in an unambiguous way.methodsa method is introduced that automatically selects features from signal measurements and constructs regression models based on a bayesian learning technique. feature spaces of different dimensionality are compared in the bayesian framework, which allows selecting a final feature combination corresponding to models with high posterior probability.resultsthis approach is applied to a large collection of electrophoretic rna measurements recorded with an agilent 2100 bioanalyzer to extract an algorithm that describes rna integrity. the resulting algorithm is a user-independent, automated and reliable procedure for standardization of rna quality control that allows the calculation of an rna integrity number (rin).conclusionour results show the importance of taking characteristics of several regions of the recorded electropherogram into account in order to get a robust and reliable prediction of rna integrity, especially if compared to traditional methods.
chemobrain experienced by breast cancer survivors: a meta-ethnography study investigating research and care implications aims and objectives to investigate women's awareness of chemotherapy-induced cognitive changes, their perception of cognitive limitations in carrying out daily tasks and subsequent return to work decisions and perceptions of work ability.   background evidence suggests that women diagnosed with breast cancer experience cognitive changes as a consequence of chemotherapy treatment. although these changes tend to be subtle deficits in memory, concentration and the ability to organise information, there has been no published research identifying how they can impact patient's ability to work and subsequent employment decisions.   design this was a qualitative study.   method data were collected from breast cancer survivors using semi-structured interviews with two focus groups (n = 6, n = 7). interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using template analysis.   results data were categorised into four main themes: (1) awareness of cognitive changes during and following chemotherapy, (2) cognitive ability and confidence in return to work, (3) impact of cognitive changes on work ability and (4) information on the cognitive side effects of chemotherapy.   conclusions the views and experiences of breast cancer survivors towards returning to work and subsequent work ability were affected by chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment. more specifically the appraisal of returning to work and ability to manage work were influenced by three interrelated factors: (1) actual cognitive ability following chemotherapy, (2) awareness of cognitive failures by the women and their families and (3) the subsequent impact on their confidence in carrying out daily tasks including work tasks.   relevance to clinical practice more information and support is needed to help patients with cancer to manage chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairments in home and workplace. nurses are increasingly asked about the impact of cancer and its treatment on work and are therefore well positioned to offer this advice. subsequently, nurses require additional knowledge and guidance to provide this information and support.
can noninvasive brain stimulation enhance cognition in neuropsychiatric disorders? background the pathophysiology of depression may include synaptic hypoactivity of left prefrontal cortex. several groups of investigators have described improved mood associated with rapid transcranial magnetic stimulation (rtms) but have not looked for possible cognitive side effects associated with left prefrontal magnetic stimulation.   methods we measured the effects of left prefrontal rtms on mood, cognition, and motor evoked potential threshold in 10 patients with medication-resistant major depression.   results in a 2-week open trial of left prefrontal rtms off antidepressant medications, scores on the hamilton rating scale for depression and the beck depression inventory decreased by 41% and 40%, respectively. after resuming pre-rtms antidepressant medication, improvement in mood was still significant at 1 and 3 months later. rtms had no adverse effects on neuropsychological performance. rtms treatments were associated with significant decreases in motor evoked potential threshold in the 9 of 10 patients who remained off psychotropic medications during the 2-week treatment period.   conclusions these preliminary data suggest that left prefrontal rtms is safe and improves mood in patients with medication-resistant major depression. changes in motor evoked potential threshold suggest that prefrontal rtms may alter brain activity at sites remote from the stimulation. double-blind, sham-controlled studies are needed.
prenatal vitamin intake during pregnancy and offspring obesity the long-term recall of height, weight, and body build was examined as part of a 1988 follow-up of the boston-based third harvard growth study (1922-1935). by design, approximately 50 percent of subjects had body mass indices during adolescence of greater than the 75th percentile, and approximately 50 percent of subjects had body mass indices between the 25th and 50th percentiles. interviewed subjects, aged 71-76 years (n = 181) were asked to recall their high school height and weight and to select outline drawings that best reflected their body size at ages 5, 10, 15, and 20 years. reports at ages 71-76 years were compared with measurements obtained during childhood and adolescence. high school weight was overestimated by men who were lean as adolescents (mean recalled minus measured difference = 2.5 kg, 95 percent confidence interval 0.78-4.3) and underestimated by women who were obese as adolescents (mean difference = -2.3 kg, 95 percent confidence interval -4.8 to 0.21). pearson crude correlations between recalled body build and body mass index measured at approximately the same ages were between 0.53 and 0.75 for all ages studied except for a correlation of 0.36 among males at age 5 years. adjustment for current body mass index only slightly reduced the correlations between adolescent body mass index and recalled build. adolescent obesity classifications based on indicators derived from recalled weight and build had moderate sensitivities (37-57 percent) and high specificities (98-100 percent). these results indicate that the remote recall of height, weight, and body size can contribute useful information independent of current weight status.
huh-7 reference genome profile: complex karyotype composed of massive loss of heterozygosity the hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumors. the hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. they include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list-reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. in addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment." recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.
comparison of clonidine and midazolam premedication before endoscopic sinus surgery: results of clinical trial the effects of clonidine, a centrally acting α2-adrenergic receptor agonist, on depth of fentanyl anesthesia and on cardiovascular response to laryngoscopy and intubation were studied. twenty-four patients undergoing aortocoronary bypass surgery (acbs) with a history of arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease (nyha class 3–4), and well-preserved left ventricular function were assigned randomly to either group 1 (n = 12), who received standard pre-medication, or group 2 (n = 12), who received clonidine 5 μ;g·kg-1 po in addition to standard premedication 90 min before estimated induction time. depth of anesthesia was assessed by on-line aperiodic computerized analysis of the electroencephalogram (lifescan eeg monitor®). fentanyl was administered in 250-μ;g increments to shift the eeg to the 0.5–3-hz frequency range (delta activity) in all subjects. in both groups, the anesthetic regimen effectively prevented hyperdynamic cardiovascular responses to laryngoscopy and intubation. no significant differences in measured or derived hemodynamic variables were observed between the two groups during the awake control period, except for stroke volume index (svi), which was significantly greater in group 1,44 ± 9 ml · beat-1 · m-2 compared with group 2, 35 ± 3.3 ml · beat-1 · m-2 (p < 0.05). by contrast, fentanyl requirements in group 2 were significantly reduced by 45% when compared with group 1, i.e., from 110 ± 23 to 61 ± 19 μ;g· kg-1(p < 0.001). the authors conclude that at a similar anesthetic depth, as assessed by the eeg shift into the lower frequency range (0.5–3 hz), a markedly reduced fentanyl dose effectively prevented the hyperdynamic cardiovascular response to laryngoscopy and intubation in the group of patients premedicated with clonidine. this is likely explained by the known synergistic inhibitory action of opiates and α2-adrenoceptor agonists on central sympathetic outflow.
ultrasonographic and magnetic resonance imaging diagnosis of an oropharyngeal wood penetrating injury in a dog. objective the purpose of this study was to identify the characteristic imaging features of wooden foreign bodies.   materials and methods the imaging studies of 12 patients with surgically confirmed wooden foreign bodies were retrospectively reviewed. the study group consisted of seven females and five males, 10-65 years old (mean age, 36 years). all patients underwent radiography. nine patients were evaluated with sonography, eight with mr imaging, three with ct, and one with ct arthrography. gadolinium-enhanced mr imaging was performed in six patients. three patients presented with a draining sinus and nine with painful swelling. only three patients presented with a history of penetrating injury.   results lesions were located in the foot (n = 4), hand (n = 3), thigh (n = 2), calf (n = 2), and elbow (n = 1). radiographs failed to reveal the retained foreign bodies in all patients. with mr imaging, wooden foreign bodies displayed a variable signal intensity that was equal to or less than that of skeletal muscle on both t1- and t2-weighted images. mr imaging showed the surrounding inflammatory response in all patients. ct showed the retained wood as linear cylindric foci of increased attenuation. wood was highly echogenic and revealed pronounced acoustic shadowing on sonography. arthrography in one patient showed an associated reactive synovitis.   conclusion the imaging appearance of wooden foreign bodies is variable; however, imaging can be quite specific, and when taken in the appropriate clinical setting, the imaging should reliably suggest the diagnosis. sonography is frequently underused but proved most useful for the evaluation of retained wooden foreign bodies.
acquired multidrug antifungal resistance in candida lusitaniae during therapy introductiontimely diagnosis of invasive candidiasis (ic) remains difficult as the clinical presentation is not specific and blood cultures lack sensitivity and need a long incubation time. thus, non-culture-based methods for diagnosing ic have been developed. mannan antigen (mn) and anti-mannan antibodies (a-mn) are present in patients with ic. on behalf of the third european conference on infections in leukemia, the performance of these tests was analysed and reviewed.methodsthe literature was searched for studies using the commercially available sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (platelia™, bio-rad laboratories, marnes-la-coquette, france) for detecting mn and a-mn in serum. the target condition of this review was ic defined according to 2008 european organization for research and treatment of cancer/mycoses study group criteria. sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratios (dor) were calculated for mn, a-mn and combined mn/a-mn testing.resultsoverall, 14 studies that comprised 453 patients and 767 controls were reviewed. the patient populations included in the studies were mainly haematological and cancer cases in seven studies and mainly intensive care unit and surgery cases in the other seven studies. all studies but one were retrospective in design. mn sensitivity was 58% (95% confidence interval [ci], 53-62); specificity, 93% (95% ci, 91-94) and dor, 18 (95% ci 12-28). a-mn sensitivity was 59% (95% ci, 54-65); specificity, 83% (95% ci, 79-97) and dor, 12 (95% ci 7-21). combined mn/a-mn sensitivity was 83% (95% ci, 79-87); specificity, 86% (95% ci, 82-90) and dor, 58 (95% ci 27-122). significant heterogeneity of the studies was detected. the sensitivity of both mn and a-mn varied for different candida species, and it was the highest for c. albicans, followed by c. glabrata and c. tropicalis. in 73% of 45 patients with candidemia, at least one of the serological tests was positive before the culture results, with mean time advantage being 6 days for mn and 7 days for a-mn. in 21 patients with hepatosplenic ic, 18 (86%) had mn or a-mn positive test results at a median of 16 days before radiological detection of liver or spleen lesions.conclusionsmn and a-mn are useful for diagnosis of ic. the performance of combined mn/a-mn testing is superior to either mn or a-mn testing.

a interaction with the cxcr 4 third intracellular loop regulates endocytosis and signaling of wt and whim-like receptors chemotaxis mediated by chemokine receptors such as cxcr4 plays a key role in lymphocyte homing and hematopoiesis as well as in breast cancer metastasis. we have demonstrated previously that β-arrestin2 functions to attenuate cxcr4-mediated g protein activation and to enhance cxcr4 internalization. here we show further that the expression of β-arrestin2 in both hela and human embryonic kidney 293 cells significantly enhances the chemotactic efficacy of stromal cell-derived factor 1α, the specific agonist of cxcr4, whereas the suppression of β-arrestin2 endogenous expression by antisense or rna-mediated interference technology considerably attenuates stromal cell-derived factor 1α-induced cell migration. expression of β-arrestin2 also augmented chemokine receptor ccr5-mediated but not epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated chemotaxis, indicating the specific effect of β-arrestin2. further analysis reveals that expression of β-arrestin2 strengthened cxcr4-mediated activation of both p38 mapk and erk, and the suppression of β-arrestin2 expression blocked the activation of two kinases. interestingly, inhibition of p38 mapk activation (but not erk activation) by its inhibitors or by expression of a dominant-negative mutant of p38 mapk effectively blocked the chemotactic effect of β-arrestin2. expression of a dominant-negative mutant of ask1 also exerted the similar blocking effect. the results of our study suggest that β-arrestin2 can function not only as a regulator of cxcr4 signaling but also as a mediator of stromal cell-derived factor 1α-induced chemotaxis and that this activity probably occurs via the ask1/p38 mapk pathway.
purification and characterization of a serine alkaline protease from bacillus clausii gmbae 42 an extracellular alkaline serine protease (called dhap), produced by a bacillus pumilus strain, demonstrates significant dehairing function. this protease is purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography, ion exchange, and gel filtration. dhap had a pi of 9.0 and a molecular weight of approximately 32,000 dalton. it shows maximal activity at ph 10 and with a temperature of 55°c; the enzyme activity can be completely inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pmsf) and diisopropyl fluorophosphates (dfp). the first 20 amino acid residues of the purified dhap have been determined with a sequence of aqtvpygipqikapavhaqg. alignment of this sequence with other alkaline protease demonstrates its high homology with protease from another b. pumilus strain.
real-time imaging of tumor-cell shedding and trafficking in lymphatic channels. the purpose of this study was to determine the independent prognostic significanceof interstitial fluid pressure (ifp) measurements in cervix cancer. a total of 102 patients with newly diagnosed cervix cancer were accrued to this prospective study. there were 31 international federation of gynecology and obstetrics stage ib or iia tumors, 40 iib tumors, and 31 iiib tumors. the median size was 5 cm (range, 2-10 cm). pelvic lymphadenopathy was identified radiographically in 20 patients. ifp was measured at examination under anesthesia using a wick-in-needle technique. multiple measurements were made in each tumor. the mean ifp in individual tumors ranged from -3 to 48 mm hg, and the median for the entire cohort was 19 mm hg. treatment consisted of external beam and intracavitary radiation without chemotherapy. median follow-up was 2.5 years. the 3-year disease-free survival of all of the patients was 53%. disease-free survival was 34% in patients with ifp >19 mm hg, and 68% in those with lower ifp (p = 0.002). to evaluate rigorously the independent prognostic significance of ifp measurements relative to established clinical factors, a multivariate model was first developed using stepwise selection of clinical covariates. tumor size (p = 0.0003) and pelvic lymph node status (p = 0.0016) comprised the clinical model. ifp, when added to this model, provided additional independent prognostic information (p = 0.0013). ifp was also significant (p = 0.0027) when the clinical factors and hypoxic proportion as determined with the eppendorf electrode were analyzed together. patients with high ifp were more likely to recur both locally and at distant sites. this study is the first to document a strong, independent prognostic importance of pretreatment ifp measurements in cervix cancer. patients with high ifp are significantly more likely than those with low ifp to recur after radiotherapy and die of progressive disease, independent of clinical prognostic factors and the results of tumor oxygen measurements.
transcriptome sequencing and expression analysis of cadmium (cd) transport and detoxification related genes in cd-accumulating salix integra heavy metal (hm)-accumulating herbaceous and woody plants are employed for phytoremediation. to develop improved strategies for enhancing phytoremediation efficiency, knowledge of the microstructural, physiological and molecular responses underlying hm-accumulation is required. here we review the progress in understanding the structural, physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying hm uptake, transport, sequestration and detoxification, as well as the regulation of these processes by signal transduction in response to hm exposure. the significance of genetic engineering for enhancing phytoremediation efficiency is also discussed. in herbaceous plants, hms are taken up by roots and transported into the root cells via transmembrane carriers for nutritional ions. the hms absorbed by root cells can be further translocated to the xylem vessels and unloaded into the xylem sap, thereby reaching the aerial parts of plants. hms can be sequestered in the cell walls, vacuoles and the golgi apparatuses. plant roots initially perceive hm stress and trigger the signal transduction, thereby mediating changes at the molecular, physiological, and microstructural level. signaling molecules such as phytohormones, reactive oxygen species (ros) and nitric oxide (no), modulate plant responses to hms via differentially expressed genes, activation of the antioxidative system and coordinated cross talk among different signaling molecules. a number of genes participated in hm uptake, transport, sequestration and detoxification have been functionally characterized and transformed to target plants for enhancing phytoremediation efficiency. fast growing woody plants hold an advantage over herbaceous plants for phytoremediation in terms of accumulation of high hm-amounts in their large biomass. presumably, woody plants accumulate hms using similar mechanisms as herbaceous counterparts, but the processes of hm accumulation and signal transduction can be more complex in woody plants.
menainv mediates synergistic cross-talk between signaling pathways driving chemotaxis and haptotaxis here we show that blocking the adhesive function of αvβ3 integrin with soluble rgd ligands, such as osteopontin or cilengitide, promoted association of rab-coupling protein (rcp) with α5β1 integrin and drove rcp-dependent recycling of α5β1 to the plasma membrane and its mobilization to dynamic ruffling protrusions at the cell front. these rcp-driven changes in α5β1 trafficking led to acquisition of rapid/random movement on two-dimensional substrates and to a marked increase in fibronectin-dependent migration of tumor cells into three-dimensional matrices. recycling of α5β1 integrin did not affect its regulation or ability to form adhesive bonds with substrate fibronectin. instead, α5β1 controlled the association of egfr1 with rcp to promote the coordinate recycling of these two receptors. this modified signaling downstream of egfr1 to increase its autophosphorylation and activation of the proinvasive kinase pkb/akt. we conclude that rcp provides a scaffold that promotes the physical association and coordinate trafficking of α5β1 and egfr1 and that this drives migration of tumor cells into three-dimensional matrices.
a mitochondria-anchored isoform of the actin-nucleating spire protein regulates mitochondrial division masterminding mitochondrial fission mitochondria are highly dynamic and undergo fusion and fission and they move in cells. defects in mitochondrial dynamics are implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases. recent findings have suggested that mitochondrial fission occurs preferentially at endoplasmic reticulum (er) contact sites, with er circumscribing mitochondria and possibly promoting the constriction of mitochondria during fission. korobova et al. (p. 464) now suggest that an er-localized formin, inf2, is required for mitochondrial fission and that inf2-mediated actin polymerization facilitates mitochondrial constriction. actin filaments between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria promote mitochondrial fission. mitochondrial fission is fundamentally important to cellular physiology. the dynamin-related protein drp1 mediates fission, and interaction between mitochondrion and endoplasmic reticulum (er) enhances fission. however, the mechanism for drp1 recruitment to mitochondria is unclear, although previous results implicate actin involvement. here, we found that actin polymerization through er-localized inverted formin 2 (inf2) was required for efficient mitochondrial fission in mammalian cells. inf2 functioned upstream of drp1. actin filaments appeared to accumulate between mitochondria and inf2-enriched er membranes at constriction sites. thus, inf2-induced actin filaments may drive initial mitochondrial constriction, which allows drp1-driven secondary constriction. because inf2 mutations can lead to charcot-marie-tooth disease, our results provide a potential cellular mechanism for this disease state.
the role of mtor signaling in the regulation of protein synthesis and muscle mass during immobilization in mice non‐technical summary  chronic mechanical loading (cml) of skeletal muscle induces growth and this effect can be blocked by the drug rapamycin. rapamycin is considered to be a highly specific inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor), and thus, many have concluded that mtor plays a key role in cml‐induced growth. however, direct evidence that mtor confers the cml‐induced activation of growth promoting events such as hypertrophy, hyperplasia and ribosome biogenesis is lacking. this study addressed that gap in knowledge by using a specialized line of transgenic mice. surprisingly, the results indicate that only a few of the growth promoting events induced by cml are fully dependent on mtor signalling (e.g. hypertrophy). these results advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate skeletal muscle mass and should help future studies aimed at identifying targets for therapies that can prevent the loss of muscle mass during conditions such as bedrest, immobilization, and ageing.
substrate water exchange in photosystem ii core complexes of the extremophilic red alga cyanidioschyzon merolae. the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem ii in plants and cyanobacteria catalyzes the oxidation of two water molecules to one molecule of dioxygen. a tetranuclear mn complex is believed to cycle through five intermediate states (s0-s4) to couple the four-electron oxidation of water with the one-electron photochemistry occurring at the photosystem ii reaction center. we have used x-ray absorption spectroscopy to study the local structure of the mn complex and have proposed a model for it, based on studies of the mn k-edges and the extended x-ray absorption fine structure of the s1 and s2 states. the proposed model consists of two di-μ-oxo-bridged binuclear mn units with mn-mn distances of ~2.7 å that are linked to each other by a mono-μ-oxo bridge with a mn-mn separation of ~3.3 å. the mn-mn distances are invariant in the native s1 and s2 states. this report describes the application of x-ray absorption spectroscopy to s3 samples created under physiological conditions with saturating flash illumination. significant changes are observed in the mn-mn distances in the s3 state compared to the s1 and the s2 states. the two 2.7 å mn-mn distances that characterize the di-μ-oxo centers in the s1 and s2 states are lengthened to ~2.8 and 3.0 å in the s3 state, respectively. the 3.3 å mn-mn and mn-ca distances also increase by 0.04-0.2 å. these changes in mn-mn distances are interpreted as consequences of the onset of substrate/water oxidation in the s3 state. mn-centered oxidation is evident during the s0→s1 and s1→s2 transitions. we propose that the changes in mn-mn distances during the s2→s3 transition are the result of ligand or water oxidation, leading to the formation of an oxyl radical intermediate formed at a bridging or terminal position. the reaction of the oxyl radical with oh-, h2o, or an oxo group during the subsequent s state conversion is proposed to lead to the formation of the o-o bond. models that can account for changes in the mn-mn distances in the s3 state and the implications for the mechanism of water oxidation are discussed.
prevalence and severity of ocular surface neoplasia in african nations and need for early interventions objective to examine the reliability of clinical examination and in vivo confocal microscopy (ivcm) in distinguishing ocular surface squamous neoplasia (ossn) from benign conjunctival lesions. design case-control study. participants sixty individuals with conjunctival lesions (ossn and benign) and 60 age-matched controls with normal conjunctiva presenting to kilimanjaro christian medical centre, moshi, tanzania. methods participants were examined and photographed, and ivcm was performed. patients with conjunctival lesions were offered excisional biopsy with histopathology and a human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) test. the ivcm images were read masked to the clinical appearance and pathology results. images were graded for several specific features and given an overall categorization (normal, benign, or malignant). a group of 8 ophthalmologists were shown photographs of conjunctival lesions and asked to independently classify as ossn or benign. main outcome measures comparison of the histopathology diagnosis with the clinical and ivcm diagnosis. results fifty-two cases underwent excisional biopsy with histopathology; 34 were on the ossn spectrum, 17 were benign, and 1 was lymphoma. the cases and controls had comparable demographic profiles. human immunodeficiency syndrome infection was more common in ossn compared with benign cases (58.8% vs. 5.6%; odds ratio, 24.3, 95% confidence interval [ci], 2.8–204; p = 0.003). clinically, ossn lesions more frequently exhibited feeder vessels and tended to have more leukoplakia and a gelatinous appearance. overall, the ophthalmologists showed moderate agreement with the histology result (average kappa = 0.51; 95% ci, 0.36–0.64). the masked grading of ivcm images reliably distinguished normal conjunctiva. however, ivcm was unable to reliably distinguish between benign lesions and ossn because of an overlap in their appearance (kappa = 0.44; 95% ci, 0.32–0.57). no single feature was significantly more frequent in ossn compared with benign lesions. the sensitivity and specificity of ivcm for distinguishing ossn from benign conjunctival lesions were 38.5% and 66.7%, respectively. conclusions in east africa, conjunctival pathology is relatively common and can present significant diagnostic challenges for the clinician. in this study, neither clinical examination nor ivcm was found to reliably distinguish ossn from benign conjunctival pathology because of an overlap in the features of these groups. therefore, ivcm cannot currently replace histopathology, and management decisions should continue to rely on careful clinical assessment supported by histopathology as indicated.
gnx-4728, a novel small molecule drug inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition, is therapeutic in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis alzheimer’s disease (ad), parkinson’s disease (pd) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) are the most common human adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases. they are characterized by prominent age-related neurodegeneration in selectively vulnerable neural systems. some forms of ad, pd, and als are inherited, and genes causing these diseases have been identified. nevertheless, the mechanisms of the neuronal cell death are unresolved. morphological, biochemical, genetic, as well as cell and animal model studies reveal that mitochondria could have roles in this neurodegeneration. the functions and properties of mitochondria might render subsets of selectively vulnerable neurons intrinsically susceptible to cellular aging and stress and overlying genetic variations, triggering neurodegeneration according to a cell death matrix theory. in ad, alterations in enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, oxidative damage, and mitochondrial binding of aβ and amyloid precursor protein have been reported. in pd, mutations in putative mitochondrial proteins have been identified and mitochondrial dna mutations have been found in neurons in the substantia nigra. in als, changes occur in mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes and mitochondrial cell death proteins. transgenic mouse models of human neurodegenerative disease are beginning to reveal possible principles governing the biology of selective neuronal vulnerability that implicate mitochondria and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. this review summarizes how mitochondrial pathobiology might contribute to neuronal death in ad, pd, and als and could serve as a target for drug therapy.
interhemispheric and intrahemispheric connectivity and manual skills in children with unilateral cerebral palsy objective to examine the reorganisation of the somatosensory system after early brain lesions.   methods we studied 12 young patients with congenital hemiplegia. causative lesions were brain malformations, periventricular injuries and cortico-subcortical lesions. we explored the somatosensory system using evoked potentials, fmri during sensory stimulation and clinical assessment of sensory function. to correlate sensory and motor function, we also performed transcranial magnetic stimulation, fmri of hand movement and assessment of motor function by means of melbourne test.   results eleven patients showed a perilesional reorganisation of primary somatosensory function, as expressed by short latency potentials following stimulation of the paretic hand; in a remaining patient, delayed latency responses (n27.1) were only elicited over the ipsilateral undamaged hemisphere. five of the eleven patients with perilesional somatosensory representation of the affected hand showed contralesional shifting of motor function, thus exhibiting sensory-motor dissociation. significant correlation was found between sensory deficit and fmri activation during sensory stimulation.   conclusions in subjects with early brain lesions, somato-sensory function is generally reorganised within the affected hemisphere. a contralesional shifting is uncommon and poorly efficient in function restoration.   significance this study confirms and further explores the difference in reorganisation capabilities of the motor and sensory system following early brain injury of different etiologies and timing.
