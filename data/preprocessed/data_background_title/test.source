global data re-allocation via communication aggregation in chapel the next generations of supercomputers are projected to have hundreds of thousands of processors. however, as the numbers of processors grow, the scalability of applications will be the dominant challenge. this forces us to reexamine some of our fundamental ways that we approach the design and use of parallel languages and runtime systems. in this paper we show how the globally shared arrays in a popular partitioned global address space (pgas) language, unified parallel c (upc), can be combined with a new collective interface to improve both performance and scalability. this interface allows subsets, or teams, of threads to perform a collective together. as opposed to mpi's communicators, our interface allows set of threads to be placed in teams instantly rather than explicitly constructing communicators, thus allowing for a more dynamic team construction and manipulation. we motivate our ideas with three application kernels: dense matrix multiplication, dense cholesky factorization and multidimensional fourier transforms. we describe how the three aforementioned applications can be succinctly written in upc thereby aiding productivity. we also show how such an interface allows for scalability by running on up to 16,384 processors on the blue-gene/l. in a few lines of upc code, we wrote a dense matrix multiply routine achieves 28.8 tflop/s and a 3d fft that achieves 2.1 tflop/s. we analyze our performance results through models and show that the machine resources rather than the interfaces themselves limit the performance.
quality of life and nutritional consequences after aboral pouch reconstruction following total gastrectomy for gastric cancer: randomized controlled trial ccg1101 quality of life is an important outcome measure in the care of patients with cancer. we developed a new scoring system specifically for the evaluation of patients with upper gastrointestinal cancer and postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction. this study was undertaken to evaluate the scoring system’s validity in comparing outcomes after gastric resection. patients with gastric cancer, 3 months to 3 years postoperatively, were surveyed using the survey instrument. postoperative dysfunction scores and the status of resuming activities of daily living were compared with the surgical procedure performed by analysis of variance and multiple-comparison techniques. of 211 patients surveyed, 165 (119 men, 46 women; mean age, 65.1 ± 10.5 years) responded. procedures included distal gastrectomy in 100, total gastrectomy in 57, and pylorus-preserving gastrectomy in 8. the overall dysfunction score was 61.8 ± 15.5. the dysfunction score was 58.9 ± 15.0 after distal gastrectomy, 66.8 ± 14.1 after total gastrectomy, and 62.4 ± 21.6 after pylorus-preserving gastrectomy. these values differed significantly among the groups (p = .007). dysfunction scores according to postoperative activity status were 49.1 ± 15.6 in 71 patients who resumed their activities, 56.9 ± 15.7 in 39 patients with reduced activities, 57.3 ± 8.8 in 15 patients with minimal activities, and 63.3 ± 11.8 (p < .05) in 16 patients who did not resume activities because of poor physical condition. this scoring system for postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction provides an objective measure of dysfunction related to specific surgical procedures and correlates with activities of daily living in the postoperative period.
a cell line-based neutralization assay for primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 isolates that use either the ccr5 or the cxcr4 coreceptor abstract we have investigated whether the identity of the coreceptor (ccr5, cxcr4, or both) used by primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) isolates to enter cd4+ cells influences the sensitivity of these isolates to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies and cd4-based agents. coreceptor usage was not an important determinant of neutralization titer for primary isolates in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. we also studied whether dualtropic primary isolates (able to use both ccr5 and cxcr4) were differentially sensitive to neutralization by the same antibodies when entering u87mg-cd4 cells stably expressing either ccr5 or cxcr4. again, we found that the coreceptor used by a virus did not greatly affect its neutralization sensitivity. similar results were obtained for ccr5- or cxcr4-expressing hos cell lines engineered to express green fluorescent protein as a reporter of hiv-1 entry. neutralizing antibodies are therefore unlikely to be the major selection pressure which drives the phenotypic evolution (change in coreceptor usage) of hiv-1 that can occur in vivo. in addition, the increase in neutralization sensitivity found when primary isolates adapt to growth in transformed cell lines in vitro has little to do with alterations in coreceptor usage.
nude-l, a novel lis1-interacting protein, belongs to a family of vertebrate coiled-coil proteins lis1 is a product of the causative gene for type i lissencephaly characterized by a smooth brain surface due to a defect in neuronal migration during brain development and a regulatory subunit of platelet‐activating factor acetylhydrolase (paf‐ah). it is also a mammalian homologue of the fungal nuclear distribution (nud) gene, nudf, which controls the migration of fungal nuclei. using the two‐hybrid system, we identified a novel lis1‐interacting protein, rat nude (rnude), and found that it is a mammalian homologue of another fungal nud gene product, nude, and xenopus mitotic phosphoprotein 43 which is phosphorylated in a cell cycle‐dependent manner. rnude and the catalytic subunits of paf‐ah interact with the n‐ and c‐termini of lis1, respectively. however, these proteins, instead of simultaneously binding to lis1, appeared to bind to lis1 in a competitive manner. these results suggest that lis1 functions in nuclear migration by interacting with multiple intracellular proteins in mammals.
a systematic review of interventions by healthcare professionals on community-dwelling postmenopausal women with osteoporosis background exercise programs improve balance, strength and agility in elderly people and thus may prevent falls. however, specific exercise programs that might be widely used in the community and that might be "prescribed" by physicians, especially for patients with osteoporosis, have not been evaluated. we conducted a randomized controlled trial of such a program designed specifically for women with osteoporosis.   methods we identified women 65 to 75 years of age in whom osteoporosis had been diagnosed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in our hospital between 1996 and 2000 and who were not engaged in regular weekly programs of moderate or hard exercise. women who agreed to participate were randomly assigned to participate in a twice-weekly exercise class or to not participate in the class. we measured baseline data and, 20 weeks later, changes in static balance (by dynamic posturography), dynamic balance (by a timed figure-eight run) and knee extension strength (by dynamometry).   results of 93 women who began the trial, 80 completed it. before adjustment for covariates, the intervention group tended to have greater, although nonsignificant, improvements in static balance (mean difference 4.8%, 95% confidence interval [ci] -1.3% to 11.0%), dynamic balance (mean difference 3.3%, 95% ci -1.7% to 8.4%) and knee extension strength (mean difference 7.8%, 95% ci -5.4% to 21.0%). mean crude changes in the static balance score were -0.85 (95% ci -2.91 to 1.21) for the control group and 1.40 (95% ci -0.66 to 3.46) for the intervention group. mean crude changes in figure-eight velocity (dynamic balance) were 0.08 (95% ci 0.02 to 0.14) m/s for the control group and 0.14 (95% ci 0.08 to 0.20) m/s for the intervention group. for knee extension strength, mean changes were -0.58 (95% ci -3.02 to 1.81) kg/m for the control group and 1.03 (95% ci -1.31 to 3.34) kg/m for the intervention group. after adjustment for age, physical activity and years of estrogen use, the improvement in dynamic balance was 4.9% greater for the intervention group than for the control group (p = 0.044). after adjustment for physical activity, cognitive status and number of fractures ever, the improvement in knee extension strength was 12.8% greater for the intervention group than for the control group (p = 0.047). the intervention group also had a 6.3% greater improvement in static balance after adjustment for rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, but this difference was not significant (p = 0.06).   interpretation relative to controls, participants in the exercise program experienced improvements in dynamic balance and strength, both important determinants of risk for falls, particularly in older women with osteoporosis.
novel technique for high-precision stereotactic irradiation of mouse brains seventy hamsters were divided equally into experimental groups a and b and control groups c-g. after treating the pouches of groups a and b animals with dmba (thrice a week) for 14 weeks, the heads of the animals received fractionated radiation of a total dose of 21gy and 42gy, respectively. the untreated pouches of groups c and d animals were similarly irradiated. the pouches of groups e and f animals were treated with dmba or mineral oil for 14 weeks, respectively. the pouches of group g animals remained untreated throughout the experiment. radiation response (rr) was not noted for 12 exophytic tumors of group a; the remaining 43 tumors showed partial response. for group b, no rr was noted for four exophytic lesions; the remaining 28 lesions revealed a combination of partial and complete response. no endophytic lesions of group a showed rr; a significant increase in radiation response was noted for group b compared with group a. in conclusion, the hamster pouch oral cancer model could be employed to study the effect of fractionated radiation.
pharmacology of src family kinases and therapeutic implications of their modulators locoregional and distant recurrence remains common and usually fatal for patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc). one promising molecular target in hnscc is the src family kinases (sfk). sfks can affect cellular proliferation and survival by activating the signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat) family of transcription factors, especially stat3. surprisingly, sustained sfk inhibition resulted in only transient inhibition of stat3. we investigated the mechanism underlying stat3 activation and its biological importance. specific c-src knockdown with small interfering rna (sirna) resulted in stat3 activation showing specificity, which was inhibited by janus-activated kinase (jak; tyk2 and jak2) depletion with sirna. sustained sfk inhibition also resulted in recovered jak-stat3 binding and jak kinase activity after an initial reduction, although jak phosphorylation paradoxically decreased. to determine the biological significance of stat3 activation, we combined specific stat3 depletion with a pharmacologic sfk inhibitor and observed increased cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. likewise, the addition of stat3- or jak-specific sirna to c-src-depleted cells enhanced cytotoxicity relative to cells incubated with c-src sirna alone. these results show that reactivation of stat3 after sustained, specific c-src inhibition is mediated through altered jak-stat3 binding and jak kinase activity and that this compensatory pathway allows for cancer cell survival and proliferation despite durable c-src inhibition. to our knowledge, this novel feedback pathway has never been described previously. given that pharmacologic sfk inhibitors are currently being evaluated in clinical trials, these results have potential clinical implications for cancer therapy.
cardiopulmonary exercise testing in adult congenital heart disease. as the longevity of patients with congenital heart disease improves, the number surviving to adulthood will continue to rise. consequently, practicing physicians can expect to encounter an increasing number of adult patients with various congenital cardiac conditions. impaired exercise tolerance in this patient population is exceptionally common; adult patients with congenital heart disease have reduced exercise capacity compared with healthy, age-matched counterparts. the different methods of evaluating exercise capacity, the characteristic physiologic abnormalities encountered in patients with various congenital cardiac conditions, the pathophysiologic mechanisms that may account for these abnormalities, and the clinical implications of these findings are discussed.
androgen-dependent apoptosis in male germ cells is regulated through the proto-oncoprotein cbl mechanisms of androgen-induced thymic involution are largely undefined. we have found that significant decreases in thymic size occur 2-4 h after a dose of testosterone is administered to castrated male mice. this rapid rate of change suggests a role for androgen-induced apoptosis in modulating the size and composition of the thymus. using thymic organ cultures to define these effects of androgens, we found that dihydrotestosterone treatment of thymus tissues from females or from castrated males results in enhancement of thymocyte apoptosis. intact (androgen-replete) or testicular feminization, tfm/y (androgen-resistant) mice failed to show apoptotic change with androgen treatment, although the apoptotic response to glucocorticoids was present, suggesting a requirement for a functional androgen receptor. acceleration of thymocyte apoptosis by androgens may mediate processes of thymocyte selection, with the potential to impart gender-specific characteristics on the peripheral t cell repertoire.
variability of motoneuron activation and the modulation of force production in a postural reflex of the hermit crab abdomen cuticular strain associated with support of the shell of the hermit crab, pagurus pollicarus, by its abdomen activates mechanoreceptors that evoke a stereotyped reflex in postural motoneurons. this reflex consists of three phases: a brief high-frequency burst of motoneuron spikes, a pause, and a much longer duration but lower frequency period of spiking. these phases are correlated with a rapid increase in muscle force followed by a slight decline to a level of tone that is greater than that at rest but less than maximal. the present experiments address the mechanisms underlying the transition from the first to second phase of the reflex and their role in force generation. although centrally generated inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (ipsps) are present during the pause period of the reflex, intracellular current injection of motoneurons reveals a spike frequency adaptation that rapidly and substantially reduces motoneuron firing frequency and is unchanged in saline that reduces synaptic transmission. the adaptation is voltage sensitive and persists for several hundred milliseconds upon repolarization. hyperpolarization partially restores the initial response of the motoneuron to depolarizing current. spike frequency adaptation and synaptic inhibition are important mechanisms in the generation of force that maintains abdominal stiffness at a constant, submaximal level.
analysis of the effects of alterations in the tick-borne encephalitis virus 3'-noncoding region on translation and rna replication using reporter replicons. abstract we have developed a reporting replicon of west nile virus (wnv) that could be used to quantitatively distinguish viral translation and rna replication. a renilla luciferase (rluc) gene was fused in-frame with the open reading frame of a subgenomic replicon in the position where the viral structural region was deleted, resulting in rlucrep. transfection of bhk cells with rlucrep rna yielded two distinctive rluc signal peaks, one between 2 and 10 h and the other after 26 h posttransfection. by contrast, only the 2- to 10-h rluc signal peak was observed in cells transfected with a mutant replicon containing an inactivated viral polymerase ns5 (rlucrep-ns5mt). immunofluorescence and real-time reverse transcriptase pcr assays showed that the levels of viral protein expression and rna replication increased in cells transfected with the rlucrep but not in those transfected with the rlucrep-ns5mt. these results suggest that the rluc signal that occurred at 2 to 10 h posttransfection reflects viral translation of the input replicon, while the rluc activity after 26 h posttransfection represents rna replication. using this system, we showed that mutations of conserved sequence (cs) elements within the 3′ untranslated region of the mosquito-borne flaviviruses did not significantly affect wnv translation but severely diminished or completely abolished rna replication. mutations of cs1 that blocked the potential base pairing with a conserved sequence in the 5′ region of the capsid gene (5′cs) abolished rna replication. restoration of the 5′cs-cs1 interaction rescued viral replication. replicons containing individual deletions of cs2, repeated cs2 (rcs2), cs3, or rcs3 were viable, but their rna replication was dramatically compromised. these results demonstrate that genome cyclization through the 5′cs-cs1 interaction is essential for wnv rna replication, whereas cs2, rcs2, cs3, and rcs3 facilitate, but are dispensable for, wnv replication.
cd13 and ror2 permit isolation of highly enriched cardiac mesoderm from differentiating human embryonic stem cells objective heterogeneity of action potential configuration in the left ventricle (lv), and the contribution of m cells to it, has been observed in the human heart and is important for arrhythmogenesis. whether the pig heart has similar properties remains a controversial but important issue as the pig heart is currently under study for use in xenotransplantation.   methods single myocytes were enzymatically isolated from the epicardium (epi, ncells = 29), midmyocardium (mid, ncells = 38), and endocardium (endo, ncells = 13) of the free lv wall (npigs = 26, 14-22 weeks old, 55-80 kg), and studied at different stimulation rates during whole-cell recording (normal tyrode's solution, k(+)-aspartate-based pipette solution, 50 microm k5fluo-3 as [ca2+]i indicator, 37 degrees c). standard six-lead ecgs were recorded from anesthetized pigs.   results the action potential duration (apd) was not significantly different at 0.25 hz vs. 2 hz for the majority of cells in all three layers. however, a subpopulation of cells behaved like m cells and had a very steep frequency response (apd90 at 0.25 hz 538 +/- 30 ms, vs. 337 +/- 9 ms at 2 hz, p < 0.05, n = 22). these cells were found predominantly in the mid layer (34% of cells), but also (24%) in epi. m cells had a more pronounced spike-and-dome configuration, with a significantly larger phase 1 magnitude and plateau voltage. the frequency response of these parameters was different from the other cell types. [ca2+]i transients tended to be larger in m cells. for the in vivo ecg of anesthetized pigs, the qt time was close to the apd90 of m cells, and j waves were seen in 7/12 recordings.   conclusions in young adult pigs, m cells can be identified by a steep frequency response of the apd and by a spike-and-dome configuration. these cells are mostly, but not exclusively, found in the midmyocardium, and could contribute to the ecg characteristics. their properties may however be different from those of other species, including humans.
evaluation of heavy metal pollution in water wells and soil using common leafy green plant indicators in the al-kharj region, saudi arabia the present study was carried out to assess levels of different heavy metals like iron, cadmium, nickel, lead, copper and zinc in vegetables irrigated with water from different sources industrial area of naini allahabad. the order of heavy metal concentration was found in fe > zn > cd > pb > ni > cu in irrigated water and fe > ni > zn > cu > cd > pb was observed in industrial contaminated sites of soils. metal levels observed in these sources were compared with who. the concentrations (mg/l) of heavy metals in irrigated water ranged from 0.249 to 0.257 for fe, 0.049 to 0.056 for zn, 0.028 to 0.036 for cd, 0.015 to 0.019 for cu, 0.035 to 0.042 for pb and 0.031 to 0.038 for ni which is lower than recommended maximum tolerable levels proposed by joint fao/who expert committee on food additives (2007), with the exception of cd and fe which exhibited elevated content. uptake and translocation factor of heavy metal from soil to edible parts of vegetables were quite distinguished for almost all elements examined. although the practice of growing leafy vegetables using wastewater for irrigation is aimed at producing socio-economic benefits but study reveals that heavy metal-contaminated vegetables grown in wastewater-irrigated areas may pose public health hazards which is not safe and may not be sustainable in the long-term.
anterior cervical interbody fusion with radiolucent carbon fiber cages: clinical and radiological results. the aim of this work was to add to the body of data on the frequency and severity of degenerative radiographic findings at adjacent levels after anterior cervical interbody fusion and on their clinical impact and to contribute to the insights about their pathogenesis. one hundred eighty patients who were treated by anterior cervical interbody fusion and who had a follow-up of >60 months were clinically and radiologically examined by independent investigators. for all patients, the long-term odom score was compared with the score as obtained 6 weeks after surgery. for myelopathic cases, both the late nurick and the odom score were compared with the initial postoperative situation. for the adjacent disc levels, a radiologic “degeneration score” was defined and assessed both initially and at long-term follow-up. at late follow-up after anterior cervical interbody fusion, additional radiologic degeneration at the adjacent disc levels was found in 92% of the cases, often reflecting a clinical deterioration. the severity of this additional degeneration correlated with the time interval since surgery. the similarity of progression to degeneration between younger trauma patients and older nontrauma patients suggests that both the biomechanical impact of the interbody fusion and the natural progression of pre-existing degenerative disease act as triggering factors for adjacent level degeneration.
the effect of alpha-lipoic acid on mitochondrial superoxide and glucocorticoid-induced hypertension diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease in the united states. despite several studies indicating a role for mitochondrial oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in the development of diabetic complications, the precise mechanisms underlying renal mitochondrial dysfunction and renal cell injury remain unclear. the hypothesis of the current study was that high-glucose-mediated generation of mitochondrial superoxide is a key early event that leads to mitochondrial injury in renal proximal tubular cells. to ascertain the role of mitochondrial superoxide we have tested whether overexpression of the primary mitochondrial antioxidant, manganese superoxide dismutase (mnsod), protects against hyperglycemia-induced renal injury using normal rat renal proximal tubular cells (nrk). nrk cells were exposed to high glucose (25 mm) and the changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential, atp levels, and superoxide generation and the loss of cell viability were measured at 24 and 48 h after high glucose exposure. our results indicate that high glucose first induced superoxide generation and hyperpolarization in the mitochondria, followed by a secondary event, which involved a decline in atp levels, partial complex iii inactivation, and loss of cell viability. these high-glucose-induced changes were completely prevented by overexpression of mnsod in nrk cells. however, mnsod activity was not changed after high glucose exposure in vitro or during the early stages of diabetes using the streptozotocin rat model. these findings show for the first time that hyperglycemic induction of superoxide production within the mitochondria initiates specific mitochondrial injury (i.e., complex iii) via a mechanism independent of mnsod inactivation.
prediction of the onset of disturbed eating behavior in adolescent girls with type 1 diabetes objective to characterize the relationship of subclinical and clinical eating disorders to hba1c values in women with iddm. research design and methods ninety women with iddm (18–46 years of age) were recruited from diabetes clinics throughout connecticut and massachusetts. subjects were categorized into one of three groups according to the diagnostic statistical manual of mental disorders (dsm-iii-r) criteria for eating disorders as follows: the clinical group (n = 14), the subclinical group (partially fulfilling the diagnostic criteria; n = 13), and the control group (n = 63). group differences in the degree of dietary restraint, binge eating, and bulimic behaviors and weight, shape, and eating concerns were assessed with the eating disorder examination (ede) and the bulimia test revised (bulit-r). results women with subclinical and clinical eating disorders had clinically elevated hba1c results and more diabetes-related complications, compared with the control subjects. the severity of bulimic behaviors, weight concerns, reduced bmi, and decreased frequency of blood glucose monitoring were associated with elevated hba1c. conclusions hba1c may have clinical utility in the identification of eating disorder behavior in females with iddm. health care professionals should be aware of the potent effect of subclinical and clinical eating behaviors including insulin misuse in weight-conscious women with iddm who have poor glycemic control.
improving recorded volume in mesial temporal lobe by optimizing stereotactic intracranial electrode implantation planning purposeboth frame-based and frameless approaches to deep brain stimulation (dbs) require planning of insertion trajectories that mitigate hemorrhagic risk and loss of neurological function. currently, this is done by manual inspection of multiple potential electrode trajectories on mr-imaging data. we propose and validate a method for computer-assisted dbs trajectory planning.methodour framework integrates multi-modal mri analysis (t1w, swi, tof-mra) to compute suitable dbs trajectories that optimize the avoidance of specific critical brain structures. a cylinder model is used to process each trajectory and to evaluate complex surgical constraints described via a combination of binary and fuzzy segmented datasets. the framework automatically aggregates the multiple constraints into a unique ranking of recommended low-risk trajectories. candidate trajectories are represented as a few well-defined cortical entry patches of best-ranked trajectories and presented to the neurosurgeon for final trajectory selection.resultsthe proposed algorithm permits a search space containing over 8,000 possible trajectories to be processed in less than 20 s. a retrospective analysis on 14 dbs cases of patients with severe parkinson’s disease reveals that our framework can improve the simultaneous optimization of many pre-formulated surgical constraints. furthermore, all automatically computed trajectories were evaluated by two neurosurgeons, were judged suitable for surgery and, in many cases, were judged preferable or equivalent to the manually planned trajectories used during the operation.conclusionsthis work provides neurosurgeons with an intuitive and flexible decision-support system that allows objective and patient-specific optimization of dbs lead trajectories, which should improve insertion safety and reduce surgical time.
clinical correlations with porphyromonas gingivalis antibody responses in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis introductionthe association between rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and periodontitis is suggested to be linked to the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis. colonization of p. gingivalis in the oral cavity of ra patients has been scarcely considered. to further explore whether the association between periodontitis and ra is dependent on p. gingivalis, we compared host immune responses in ra patients with and without periodontitis in relation to presence of cultivable p. gingivalis in subgingival plaque.methodsin 95 ra patients, the periodontal condition was examined using the dutch periodontal screening index for treatment needs. subgingival plaque samples were tested for presence of p. gingivalis by anaerobic culture technique. iga, igg and igm antibody titers to p. gingivalis were measured by elisa. serum and subgingival plaque measures were compared to a matched control group of non-ra subjects.resultsa higher prevalence of severe periodontitis was observed in ra patients in comparison to matched non-ra controls (27% versus 12%, p < 0.001). ra patients with severe periodontitis had higher das28 scores than ra patients with no or moderate periodontitis (p < 0.001), while no differences were seen in igm-rf or acpa reactivity. furthermore, ra patients with severe periodontitis had higher igg- and igm-anti p. gingivalis titers than non-ra controls with severe periodontitis (p < 0.01 resp. p < 0.05), although subgingival occurrence of p. gingivalis was not different.conclusionsseverity of periodontitis is related to severity of ra. ra patients with severe periodontitis have a more robust antibody response against p. gingivalis than non-ra controls, but not all ra patients have cultivable p. gingivalis.

anaplasma phagocytophilum asp14 is an invasin that interacts with mammalian host cells via its c terminus to facilitate infection anaplasma phagocytophilum, ehrlichia chaffeensis and ehrlichia ewingii are emerging tick-borne pathogens and are the causative agents of human granulocytic anaplasmosis, human monocytic ehrlichiosis and e. ewingii ehrlichiosis, respectively. collectively, these are referred to as human ehrlichioses. these obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens of the family anaplasmataceae are transmitted by ixodes spp. or amblyomma americanum ticks and infect peripherally circulating leukocytes to cause infections that range in clinical spectra from asymptomatic seroconversion to mild, severe or, in rare instances, fatal disease. this review describes: the ecology of each pathogen; the epidemiology, clinical signs and symptoms of the human diseases that each causes; the choice methods for diagnosing and treating human ehrlichioses; recommendations for patient management; and is concluded with suggestions for potential future research.
pre-transplant donor-specific anti-human leukocyte antigen antibodies are associated with high risk of delayed graft function after renal transplantation. delayed graft function (dgf) is a common complication of deceased donor kidney transplantation with negative impact on clinical outcomes. in a single‐center retrospective analysis, we compared patient and kidney survival, early renal function, and the incidence of acute rejection during the first year among all adult deceased donor kidney transplant patients without dgf, with dgf requiring one‐time and/or more than one‐time dialysis treatment between january 1, 2000, and december 31, 2008. of 831 adult kidney transplant patients, 74 (8.9%) required one‐time and 134 (16.1%) more than one‐time dialysis treatment post‐transplantation, respectively. while dgf patients with one‐time dialysis treatment had comparable clinical outcomes to that of patients without dgf, patients with dgf requiring more than one‐time dialysis treatment had a 45% increased risk for death (hr 1.45, 95% ci 1.02, 2.05, p = 0.04) after adjustment for the differences in demographic and baseline characteristics. furthermore, dgf patients with more than one‐time dialysis requirement displayed significantly lower renal function after recovery (or 0.32, 95% ci 0.21, 0.49, p < 0.001, for egfr ≥ 60 ml/min) and higher incidence of acute rejection during the first year (or 1.66, 95% ci 1.11, 2.49, p = 0.015). additional studies of therapeutic approaches to manage patients with prolonged dgf are needed.
sparsity constrained sinogram inpainting for metal artifact reduction in x-ray computed tomography traditional computed tomography (ct) reconstructions of total joint prostheses are limited by metal artifacts from corrupted projection data. published metal artifact reduction methods are based on the assumption that severe attenuation of x-rays by prostheses renders corresponding portions of projection data unavailable, hence the "missing" data are either avoided (in iterative reconstruction) or interpolated (in filtered back-projection with data completion; typically, with filling data "gaps" via linear functions). here, the authors propose a wavelet-based multiresolution analysis method for metal artifact reduction, in which information is extracted from corrupted projection data. the wavelet method improves image quality by a successive interpolation in the wavelet domain. theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the metal artifacts due to both photon starving and beam hardening can be effectively suppressed using the authors' method. as compared to the filtered back-projection after linear interpolation, the wavelet-based reconstruction is significantly more accurate for depiction of anatomical structures, especially in the immediate neighborhood of the prostheses. this superior imaging precision is highly advantageous in geometric modeling for fitting hip prostheses.
explaining software developer acceptance of methodologies: a comparison of five theoretical models success at attempted weight reduction among college women was predicted on the basis of a theory of planned behavior. at the beginning of a 6-week period, participants expressed their attitudes, subjective norms, perceived control, and intentions with respect to losing weight. in addition, the extent to which they had made detailed weight reduction plans was assessed, as were a number of general attitudes and personality factors. in support of the theory, intentions to lose weight were accurately predicted on the basis of attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived control; perceived control and intentions were together moderately successful in predicting the amount of weight that participants actually lost over the 6-week period. actual weight loss was also found to increase with development of a plan and with ego strength, factors that were assumed to increase control over goal attainment. other factors, such as health locus of control, perceived competence, and action control, were found to be unrelated to weight reduction.
a novel mechanism for nicotinic potentiation of glutamatergic synapses activity-dependent gene expression is essential for form and function in the nervous system. best understood is the role of glutamatergic signaling in controlling such events, but nicotinic signaling can also regulate transcription. we show here that nicotine can alter gene expression in rat hippocampal neurons, as reflected by activation of the transcription factor creb and appearance of the immediate early gene product c-fos. the process depends on both cam and map kinases and on calcium release from internal stores. part of the nicotinic effect is mediated via glutamatergic transmission, even in the absence of action potentials. voltage-gated calcium channels are not necessary for nicotine-induced activation of creb in hippocampal neurons. the low levels of sustained nicotinic stimulation required for transcriptional effects are consistent with those likely to be achievable either by the normal septal cholinergic innervation of the hippocampus or by repeated tobacco usage.
mechanisms of postinhibitory rebound and its modulation by serotonin in excitatory swim motor neurons of the medicinal leech bath application of dopamine modifies the rhythmic motor pattern generated by the 14 neuron pyloric network in the stomatogastric ganglion of the spiny lobster, panulirus interruptus. among other effects, dopamine excites many of the pyloric constrictor (py) neurons to fire at high frequency and phase-advances the timing of their activity in the motor pattern. these responses arise in part from direct actions of dopamine to modulate the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of the py cells, and can be studied in synaptically isolated neurons. the rate of rebound following a hyperpolarizing prestep and the spike frequency during a subsequent depolarization are both accelerated by dopamine. based on theoretical simulations, hartline (1979) suggested that the rate of postinhibitory rebound in stomatogastric neurons could vary with the amount of voltage- sensitive transient potassium current (ia). consistent with this prediction, we found that dopamine evokes a net conductance decrease in synaptically isolated py neurons. in voltage clamp, dopamine reduces ia, specifically by reducing the amplitude of the slowly inactivating component of the current and shifting its voltage activation curve in the depolarized direction. 4-aminopyridine, a selective blocker of ia in stomatogastric neurons, mimics and occludes the effects of dopamine on isolated py neurons. a conductance-based mathematical model of the py neuron shows appropriate changes in activity upon quantitative modification of the ia parameters affected by dopamine. these results demonstrate that dopamine excites and phase-advances the py neurons in the rhythmic pyloric motor pattern at least in part by reducing the transient k+ current, ia.
activation of grs–akt–nnos–nr2b signaling pathway by second dose gr agonist contributes to exacerbated hyperalgesia in a rat model of radicular pain objective to determine the effectiveness and predictors of response to lumbar epidural corticosteroid injections (esi) in patients with sciatica. we performed a 12-month, multicentre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial in four secondary pain-care clinics in the wessex region.   methods two hundred and twenty-eight patients with a clinical diagnosis of unilateral sciatica of 1-18 months' duration were randomized to either three lumbar esis of triamcinolone acetonide or interligamentous saline injections at intervals of 3 weeks. the main outcome measure was the oswestry low back pain disability questionnaire (odq).   results at 3 weeks, the esi group demonstrated a transient benefit over the placebo group (patients achieving a 75% improvement in odq, 12.5 vs 3.7%; number needed to treat, 11.4). no benefit was demonstrated from 6 to 52 weeks. esis did not improve physical function, hasten return to work or reduce the need for surgery. there was no benefit of repeated esis over single injection. no clinical predictors of response were found. at the end of the study the majority of patients still had significant pain and disability regardless of intervention.   conclusions in this pragmatic study, esis offered transient benefit in symptoms at 3 weeks in patients with sciatica, but no sustained benefits in terms of pain, function or need for surgery. sciatica is a chronic condition requiring a multidisciplinary approach. to fully investigate the value of esis, they need to be evaluated as part of a multidisciplinary approach.
haemocyte apoptosis of the tiger shrimp penaeus monodon exposed to cadmium lack of shrimp cell lines has hindered the study of pollutants which adversely affects shrimp health and its export value. in this context a primary haemocyte culture developed from penaeus monodon was employed for assessing the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of two heavy metal compounds, cadmium chloride and mercuric chloride and two organophosphate insecticides, malathion and monocrotophos. using mtt assay 12 h ic(50) values calculated were 31.09 ± 16.27 μm and 5.52 ± 1.16 μm for cadmium chloride and mercuric chloride and 59.94 ± 52.30 mg l(-1) and 186.76 ± 77.00 mg l(-1) for malathion and monocrotophos respectively. employing comet assay, dna damage inflicted by these pollutants on haemocytes were evaluated and the pollutants induced dna damage in >60% of the cells. the study suggested that haemocyte culture could be used as a tool for quantifying cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of aquaculture drugs, management chemicals and pollutants.
the sugarless mutation affects the expression of the white eye color gene in drosophila melanogaster in vitro experiments suggest that glycosaminoglycans (gags) and the proteins to which they are attached (proteoglycans) are important for modulating growth factor signaling. however, in vivo evidence to support this view has been lacking, in part because mutations that disrupt the production of gag polymers and the core proteins have not been available. here we describe the identification and characterization of drosophila mutants in the suppenkasper (ska) gene. the ska gene encodes udp-glucose dehydrogenase which produces glucuronic acid, an essential component for the synthesis of heparan and chondroitin sulfate. ska mutants fail to put heparan side chains on proteoglycans such as syndecan. surprisingly, mutant embryos produced by germ-line clones of this general metabolic gene exhibit embryonic cuticle phenotypes strikingly similar to those that result from loss-of-function mutations in genes of the wingless (wg) signaling pathway. zygotic loss of ska leads to reduced growth of imaginal discs and pattern defects similar to wg mutants. in addition, genetic interactions of ska with wg and dishevelled mutants are observed. these data demonstrate the importance of proteoglycans and gags in wg signaling in vivo and suggest that wnt-like growth factors may be particularly sensitive to perturbations of gag biosynthesis.
master thesis opponent report background and related work grounded theory, as an evolving qualitative research method, is a product of its history as well as of its epistemology. within the literature, there have been a number of discussions focusing on the differences between glaser's (1978, 1992) and strauss's (1987, 1990) versions of grounded theory. the purpose of this article is to add a level of depth and breadth to this discussion through specifically exploring the glaser-strauss debate by comparing the data analysis processes and procedures advocated by glaser and by strauss. to accomplish this task, the authors present the article in two sections. first, they provide relevant background information on grounded theory as a research method. second, they pursue a more in-depth discussion of the positions of glaser, using glaser's work, and strauss, using strauss's and strauss and corbin's (1990) work, regarding the different phases of data analysis, specifically addressing the coding procedures, verification, and the issue of forcing versus emergence.
ex-vivo α-galactosylceramide activation of nkt cells in humans and macaques. flow cytometry has become a powerful technique to measure intracellular cytokine production in lymphocytes and monocytes. appropriate inhibition of the secretion of the produced cytokines is required for studying intracellular cytokine expression. the aim of this study was to compare the capacity of cytokine secretion inhibitors, monensin and brefeldin a, in order to trap cytokine production (interleukin-1 beta [il-1beta], il-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha [tnf-alpha]) within peripheral blood monocytes. a two-color flow cytometric technique was used to measure intracellular spontaneous and lipopolysaccharide (lps)-stimulated il-1beta, il-6, and tnf-alpha production in monocytes (cd14+) of whole blood cultures. the viability of monensin-treated monocytes was slightly lower than that of brefeldin a-inhibited monocytes, as measured with propidium iodide (pi). the percentage of il-6 and tnf-alpha-producing monocytes after 8 h of culture without stimulation revealed significant lower values for monensin-treated than for brefeldin a-treated monocytes. the percentages for stimulated cells did not differ. the spontaneous intracellular production in molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome units (mesf) of il-1beta, il-6, and tnf-alpha after 8 h of culture was higher in brefeldin a than in monensin-inhibited monocytes. the lps-stimulated intracellular production of il-1beta, il-6, and tnf-alpha was increased in brefeldin a-inhibited monocytes. in conclusion, for flow cytometric determination of intracellular monocytic cytokines (il-1beta, il-6, and tnf-alpha), brefeldin a is a more potent, effective, and less toxic inhibitor of cytokine secretion than monensin.
feline exocrine pancreatic insufficiency: 16 cases (1992–2007)⋆ hypocobalaminaemia in cats has previously been identified, but the incidence reported has varied, and the frequency of folate deficiency is unknown. the aims of this study were to evaluate the incidence of low cobalamin and folate levels in a population of cats that were suffering predominantly from diseases of the alimentary tract (including the liver and pancreas) and to ascertain whether severity of disease (as assessed by bodyweight and body condition score (bcs)) related to degree of deficiency. the study population comprised 103 cats, of which 16.5% had low cobalamin levels and 38.8% had low folate levels. a serendipitous finding was inorganic phosphate levels below the reference range in 48% of the cases. significant associations were found between subnormal cobalamin levels and median bcs (p=0.049); combined low folate and low cobalamin and bodyweight (p=0.002), bcs (p=0.024) and inorganic phosphate levels (p=0.003). the finding of low levels of folate and cobalamin in clinical cases suggests that supplementation may be indicated more frequently than is currently recognised.
multiple sulfur isotopes and the evolution of earth's surface sulfur cycle abstract the mass-dependent fractionation laws that describe the partitioning of isotopes are different for kinetic and equilibrium reactions. these laws are characterized by the exponent relating the fractionation factors for two isotope ratios such that α2/1 = α3/1β. the exponent β for equilibrium exchange is (1/m1 − 1/m2)/(1/m1 − 1/m3), where mi are the atomic masses and m1
differential effects of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht)1a receptor inverse agonists rec 27/0224 and rec 27/0074 on electrophysiological responses to 5-ht1a receptor activation in rat dorsal raphe nucleus and hippocampus in vitro 1 the acute inhibitory effect of selective 5‐hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) reuptake inhibitors (ssris) on 5‐ht neuronal activity may offset their ability to increase synaptic 5‐ht in the forebrain. 2here, we determined the effects of the ssri, paroxetine, and a novel selective 5‐ht1a receptor antagonist, way 100635, on 5‐ht cell firing in the dorsal raphe nucleus (drn), and on extracellular 5‐ht in both the drn and the frontal cortex (fcx). extracellular electrophysiological recording and brain microdialysis were used in parallel experiments, in anaesthetized rats. 3 paroxetine dose‐dependently inhibited the firing of 5‐ht neurones in the drn, with a maximally effective dose of approximately 0.8 mg kg−1, i.v. way 100635 (0.1 mg kg−1, i.v.) both reversed the inhibitory effect of paroxetine and, when used as a pretreatment, caused a pronounced shift to the right of the paroxetine dose‐response curve. 4 paroxetine (0.8 mg kg−1, i.v.), doubled extracellular 5‐ht in the drn, but did not alter extracellular 5‐ht in the fcx. a higher dose of paroxetine (2.4 mg kg−1, i.v.) did increase extracellular 5‐ht in the fcx, but to a lesser extent than in the drn. whereas 0.8 mg kg−1, i.v. paroxetine alone had no effect on extracellular 5‐ht in the fcx, in rats pretreated with way 100635 (0.1 mg kg−1), paroxetine (0.8 mg kg−1, i.v.) markedly increased extracellular 5‐ht in the fcx. 5 in conclusion, pretreatment with the selective 5‐ht1a receptor antagonist, way 100635, blocked the inhibitory effect of paroxetine on 5‐ht neuronal activity in the drn and, at the same time, markedly enhanced the effect of paroxetine on extracellular 5‐ht in the fcx. these results may be relevant to recent clinical observations that 5‐ht1a receptor antagonists in combination with ssris have a rapid onset of antidepressant effect.
different effects of statins on induction of diabetes mellitus: an experimental study many anecdotal reports have suggested that therapy with hmg-coa reductase inhibitors (‘statins’) can cause acute pancreatitis. we aimed to quantify the association between statins and pancreatitis and to classify the adverse effect under the dose, time, susceptibility (dots) system.we searched for controlled observational studies that assessed the risk of pancreatitis in patients receiving statins. in order to identify case reports of statin-induced pancreatitis, we looked for reports published in scientific journals and manually reviewed reports within the canadian adverse drug event monitoring system (cadrmp) database.two observational studies were identified and the data pooled together in a meta-analysis. this yielded an odds ratio of 1.41 (95% ci 1.15, 1.74) for the risk of acute pancreatitis in patients with a past history of exposure to statins. we also identified 20 published case reports and 33 spontaneous reports from the cadrmp database. these data showed that pancreatitis can occur at both high and low doses, with 12 cases developing pancreatitis at less than the dose equivalent of simvastatin 20mg daily. statin-induced pancreatitis can occur at any time but seems to be very uncommon early on and more likely to occur after many months of therapy. there does not appear to be a cumulative dose effect and increasing age does not appear to be a major susceptibility factor. these finding should help clinicians to better manage and diagnose patients who are at risk of statin-induced pancreatitis.
management and prognostic factors of recurrent pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid gland: personal experience and review of the literature surgery for recurrent parotid pleomorphic adenoma is a challenging problem.
new and old genes associated with primary and established responses to cisplatin and topotecan treatment in ovarian cancer cell lines epidermal differentiation complex (edc) comprises a number of genes associated with human skin diseases including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and hyperkeratosis. these genes have also been linked to numerous cancers, among them skin, gastric, colorectal, lung, ovarian and renal carcinomas. the involvement of edc components encoding s100 proteins, small proline-rich proteins (sprrs) and other genes in the tumorigenesis of head and neck squamous cell cancer (hnscc) has been previously suggested. the aim of the study was to systematically analyze the expression of edc components on the transcript level in hnscc. tissue specimens from 93 patients with hnc of oral cavity and 87 samples from adjacent or distant grossly normal oral mucosawere analyzed. 48 samples (24 tumor and 24 corresponding surrounding tissue) were hybridized to affymetrix genechip human 1.0 st arrays. for validation by quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) the total rna from all180 samples collected in the study was analyzed with real-time pcr system and fluorescent amplicon specific-probes. additional set of samples from 14 patients with laryngeal carcinoma previously obtained by hg-u133 plus 2.0 microarray was also included in the analyses. the expression of analyzed edc genes was heterogeneous. two transcripts (s100a1 and s100a4) were significantly down-regulated in oral cancer when compared to normal mucosa (0.69 and 0.36-fold change, respectively), showing an opposite pattern of expression to the remaining s100 genes. significant up-regulation in tumors was found for s100a11, s100a7, lce3d, s100a3 and s100a2 genes. the increased expression of s100a7 was subsequently validated by qpcr, confirming significant differences. the remaining edc genes, including all encoding sprr molecules, did not show any differences between oral cancer and normal mucosa. the observed differences were also assessed in the independent set of laryngeal cancer samples, confirming the role of s100a3 and lce3d transcripts in hnc. in hnc of oral cavity only one family of edc genes (s100 proteins) showed significant cancer-related differences. a number of other transcripts which showed altered expression in hnc require further validation.
trf/mir-1280 suppresses stem cell-like cells and metastasis in colorectal cancer. gata binding protein 3 (gata3) is a transcriptional activator highly expressed by the luminal epithelial cells in the breast. here we did a meta-analysis of the available breast cancer cdna data sets on a cohort of 305 patients and found that gata3 was one of the top genes with low expression in invasive carcinomas with poor clinical outcome. to validate its prognostic utility, we did a tissue microarray analysis on a cohort of 139 consecutive invasive carcinomas (n = 417 tissue samples) immunostained with a monoclonal antibody against gata3. low gata3 expression was associated with higher histologic grade (p < 0.001), positive nodes (p = 0.002), larger tumor size (p = 0.03), negative estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor (p < 0.001 for both), and her2-neu overexpression (p = 0.03). patients whose tumors expressed low gata3 had significantly shorter overall and disease-free survival when compared with those whose tumors had high gata3 levels. the hazard ratio of metastasis or recurrence according to the gata3 status was 0.31 (95% confidence interval, 0.13-0.74; p = 0.009). cox multivariate analysis showed that gata3 had independent prognostic significance above and beyond conventional variables. our data suggest that immunohistochemical analysis of gata3 may be the basis for a new clinically applicable test to predict tumor recurrence early in the progression of breast cancer.
development of ssr markers from musa balbisiana for genetic diversity analysis among thai bananas directly labelling locus‐specific primers for microsatellite analysis is expensive and a common limitation to small‐budget molecular ecology projects. more cost‐effective end‐labelling of pcr products can be achieved through a three primer pcr approach, involving a fluorescently labelled universal primer in combination with modified locus‐specific primers with 5′ universal primer sequence tails. this technique has been widely used but has been limited largely due to a lack of available universal primers suitable for co‐amplifying large numbers of size overlapping loci and without requiring locus‐specific pcr conditions to be modified. in this study, we report a suite of four high‐performance universal primers that can be employed in a three primer pcr approach for efficient and cost‐effective fluorescent end‐labelling of pcr fragments. amplification efficiency is maximized owing to high universal primer tm values (approximately 60+ °c) that enhance primer versatility and enable higher annealing temperatures to be employed compared with commonly used universal primers such as m13. we demonstrate that these universal primers can be combined with multiple fluorophores to co‐amplify multiple loci efficiently via multiplex pcr. this method provides a level of multiplexing and pcr efficiency similar to microsatellite fluorescent detection assays using directly labelled primers while dramatically reducing project costs. primer performance is tested using several alternative pcr strategies that involve both single and multiple fluorophores in single and multiplex pcr across a wide range of taxa.
comparison of beta-catenin with tgf-beta1, hif-1alpha and patients’ disease-free survival in human colorectal cancer nuclear beta-catenin and cd133 are linked with two hallmarks of colon cancer, wingless-type mouse mammary tumour virus integration site (wnt)-pathway dysregulation and colon cancer stem cells (co-cscs), respectively. both molecules may be related, as co-cscs were proposed to require activated wnt-signalling and as cd133 was postulated as a wnt/beta-catenin target gene. herein, we investigated the expression of these markers on serial sections of 162 stage iia colonic adenocarcinomas. we found that the expression of these molecules is statistically independent and that they mark distinct but overlapping subpopulations of the tumour cells. moreover, we show that their combined evaluation can identify colon cancer cases with vastly reduced survival (hazard ratio (hr) 13.4, 95% confidence interval (ci): 4.7-38.2) and a high risk of tumour progression (hr 6.8, 95%ci: 3.1-15.0). in conclusion, the independence of these markers may on the one hand have implications for their presumed value to identify co-cscs; on the other hand it allows their combined analysis to become a powerful tool to identify high risk cases of stage iia colon cancer.
ontogeny of postnatal hyoid and larynx descent in humans. children with craniofacial syndromes, especially those with midfacial hypoplasia, micrognathia, or deformation of the cranial base, are frequently suffering from obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (osas). it is important to recognize this condition. diagnostic methods and therapeutic developments are discussed. experience with 31 patients in the sophia children's hospital is presented. the majority of these infants suffered from moderate or severe osas. treatment varied from symptomatic (e.g. continuous positive airway pressure) to curative. these therapies could often prevent a tracheotomy. still more curative treatment options are needed.
the association between active and passive smoking and latent tuberculosis infection in adults and children in the united states: results from nhanes the influence of tobacco smoke on human health is still an important problem worldwide. complex inflammatory processes and changes in the immune system are crucial in the pathogenesis of smoking related disorders like chronic obstructive lung disease (copd), lung cancer, atherosclerosis. the objective of this review is to present the alterations in the immune system in smokers. the main affected system by cigarette smoke (cs) is the respiratory tract. in bronchial epithelium metaplastic and dysplastic changes are accompanied by elevated expression of adhesion molecules and secretion of many cytokines capable of stimulation immune cells influx. in the population of pulmonary macrophages an elevated proportion of cells, changes in expression surface markers with impaired phagocytic and antigen presenting function are observed. chronic exposure to cs causes increased production of metalloproteinases (mmp) by macrophages and proteolitic enzymes by neutrophils. these enzymes cause destruction of alveolar wall. increased apoptosis of lung tissue results in augmentation of foreign material which may play a role of autoantigen and which is a target for cytotoxic/suppressor cells. the role of regulatory t (treg) cells in this process is recently postulated. smoking cessation is the most effective method of prophylaxis and treatment of diseases related to tobacco smoking. however many immunological changes in smokers are not completely reversible after quitting smoking.
the opportunistic pathogen vibrio vulnificus produces outer membrane vesicles in a spatially distinct manner related to capsular polysaccharide background. vibrio cholerae excreted by cholera patients is “hyperinfectious” (hi), which can be modeled by passage through infant mice. immunization of adult female mice with v. cholerae outer-membrane vesicles (omvs) passively protects suckling mice from challenge. although v. cholerae is unable to colonize protected pups, the bacteria survive passage and have the potential to be transmitted to susceptible individuals. here, we investigated the impact of omv immunization and the hi state on v. cholerae transmission. methods. neonatal mice suckled by omv- or sham-immunized dams were challenged with hi v. cholerae. the infectivity of spatially and temporally separate v. cholerae populations obtained from infected naive or protected pups was tested. recombination-based in vivo expression technology was used to assess virulence gene expression within these populations. results. omv immunization significantly reduced colonization of neonates challenged with hi v. cholerae. vibrio cholerae that had colonized the naive host was hi, whereas v. cholerae excreted by neonates born to omv-immunized dams, although viable, was hypoinfectious and failed to fully induce virulence gene expression. conclusions. omv immunization can significantly reduce the v. cholerae burden upon challenge with hi v. cholerae and can also block transmission from immune mice by reducing the infectivity of shed bacteria.
dietary patterns throughout adult life are associated with body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure, and red cell folate. this book provides a practical introduction to some important aspects of longitudinal data analysis for both observational and experimental studies. the definition of longitudinal data used, is where the same outcomes are measured at several different time points. the consequence of using this definition is that techniques using a single terminal event, such as death or onset of a chronic disease as their outcome, including survival analysis, are outside the scope of this book. this is not really a limitation, as it allows the book to focus on concepts and methods that are all too often overlooked by epidemiologists and other researchers conducting longitudinal research. increasingly, standard statistical software packages provide the resources to conduct truly longitudinal analyses as described in this book, so more epidemiologists should be using these techniques to get more from their longitudinal material. this book will appeal especially to those who would like to use more appropriate statistics for longitudinal analysis without having to work through their entire mathematical derivation. of course, no book on statistics would be complete without a few equations, but they are sparingly used and shouldn’t deter the mathematically challenged. an attractive feature is that examples are illustrated using output from the relevant software packages to aid interpretation of results and there is a section on software covering procedures in stata, sas, spss, s-plus and mlwin. after an introduction to some basic concepts in longitudinal research, the book goes on to discuss techniques for investigating the associations of predictive measures with outcomes at repeated time points. there are separate sections for continuous and dichotomous outcomes; beginning with simpler approaches and moving on to more sophisticated techniques. there is also some coverage of the potentially more complicated analyses using ordered categorical outcomes, that can be modelled using methods equivalent to polytomous or multinomial logistic regression. while some more basic and familiar methods are coved, the most comprehensively discussed techniques are generalised estimating equations and random coefficient analysis, which effectively provide equivalents of both linear and logistic regression for longitudinal data. why does longitudinal data analysis require methods such as generalised estimating equations and random coefficient analysis rather than other, more familiar, techniques? because the more basic techniques cannot capture and quantify the complex development of relationships between predictor and outcome variables over time, central to studies of many biological phenomena such as growth and age-dependent variation in blood pressure. this book offers practical advice on measuring associations that may change over time, where time is considered continuously or categorically and there is also coverage of time-lag effects. such a longitudinal approach allows investigation of variation both within subjects and between groups over time. quantification of the stability of associations over time can be undertaken and this can form part of an assessment for longitudinal development of disease risks. a problem that often plagues longitudinal research is that of missing values. of course this is a problem for cross sectional studies too, but repeated measures often compound difficulties associated with missing data. the book discusses methods to assess if patterns of missing data are independent of predictor or outcome variables and suggest some strategies to minimise their impact on the results, including imputation techniques. at present, many epidemiological researchers do not exploit fully their longitudinal data. this is because they employ cross-sectional techniques or methods that only poorly measure changing associations over time. most of this book is written in a style that will be understood by non-statisticians and it could encourage fuller use of longitudinal data by epidemiologists.
advances in diagnosis, surveillance, and monitoring of zika virus: an update rapid and accurate diagnosis of infectious agents is essential for patient care, disease control, and countermeasure development. the present serologic diagnosis of zika virus (zikv) infection relies mainly on igm-capture elisa which is confounded with the flaw of cross-reactivity among different flaviviruses. in this communication, we report a multiplex microsphere immunoassay (mia) that captures the diagnostic power of viral envelope protein (that elicits robust, yet cross-reactive antibodies to other flaviviruses) and the differential power of viral nonstructural proteins ns1 and ns5 (that induce more virus-type specific antibodies). using 153 patient specimens with known zikv and/or dengue virus (denv; a closely related flavivirus) infections, we showed that (i) zikv envelope-based mia is equivalent or more sensitive than igm-capture elisa in diagnosing zikv infection, (ii) antibody responses to ns1 and ns5 proteins are more zikv-specific than antibody response to envelope protein, (iii) inclusion of ns1 and ns5 in the mia improves the diagnostic accuracy when compared with the mia that uses envelope protein alone. the multiplex mia achieves a rapid diagnosis (turnaround time < 4 h) and requires small specimen volume (10 μl) in a single reaction. this serologic assay could be developed for use in clinical diagnosis of zikv infection and for monitoring immune responses in vaccine trials.
effect of handling on neurotransmitter profile in pig brain according to fear related behaviour the serotonin system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis play important roles in modulating fear and stress-coping characteristics. tonic immobility (ti) is a fear-related phenotype, and previously we have shown that broiler chickens showing short ti (sti) duration experience better growth performance and higher adaptability to stress. here, we sought to further elucidate the central mechanisms underlying the phenotypic differences between chickens showing sti and long ti duration, by comparing the hypothalamic expression of genes in the serotonergic system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis under basal and corticosterone-exposed situations. the sti broilers had significantly lower (p < 0.01) hypothalamic expression of serotonin reuptake transporter and serotonin receptor 1a. moreover, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 was expressed significantly lower in sti chickens at the level of both mrna (p < 0.01) and protein (p < 0.05). hypothalamic expression of glucocorticoid receptor (gr) mrna tended to be higher (p < 0.059) in long ti chickens, but the protein content was approximately 2 times higher (p < 0.01) in sti chickens. the uncoupled expression of gr mrna and protein was associated with significantly lower (p < 0.05) expression of gga-mir-181a, gga-mir-211, and gga-mir-22, which are predicted to target gr, in sti chickens. corticosterone administration reduced the mrna expression of postsynaptic serotonin receptors, 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1b (p = 0.059) and 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 7 (p < 0.05), yet significantly increased the protein content of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (p < 0.05). these results suggest that broilers of different ti phenotypes have a distinct pattern of hypothalamic expression of fear- and stress-related genes.
evaluation of lateral spinal hemisection as a preclinical model of spinal cord injury pain the mechanisms underlying central pain following spinal cord injury (sci) are unsettled. the purpose of the present study was to examine differences in spinothalamic tract function below injury level and evoked pain in incomplete sci patients with neuropathic pain below injury level (central pain) versus those without such pain. a clinical examination, quantitative sensory testing and magnetic resonance imaging (mri) were performed in 10 sci patients with below-level pain and in 11 sci patients without neuropathic pain. patients with and without pain had similar reductions of mechanical and thermal detection thresholds below injury level. sci patients with central pain had sensory hypersensitivity in dermatomes corresponding to the lesion level more frequently than sci patients without pain, but this may in part be explained by the exclusion of at-level spontaneous pain in the pain-free group. the rostral-caudal extent of the lesion measured by mri did not differ between the two patient groups, and there were no statistically significant differences in any of the predefined areas of interest on the axial plane images. this study suggests that neuronal hyperexcitability plays a key role in central sci pain and furthermore - in contrast to previous findings - that loss of spinothalamic functions does not appear to be a predictor for central neuropathic pain in spinal cord injury.
diet and vitamin or mineral supplements and risk of renal cell carcinoma in canada the role of diet in the aetiology of renal cell carcinoma was investigated in a population-based case-control study in denmark. cases were 20-79 years old, with a histologically verified diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma. controls were sampled from the general population and were frequency-matched on age and sex. a total of 351 cases (73% of the eligible) and 340 controls (68% of the eligible) were included in the study. dietary information was obtained in a self-administered food frequency questionnaire and the information was confirmed in a subsequent interview performed by trained interviewers who also elicited information on other suspected risk factors such as smoking, occupation, medical history, education and reproductive history. logistic regression models were used to calculate the odds ratios, and, both frequency of consumption of various food stuffs and computed nutrients were examined. a positive association was observed between risk of renal cell carcinoma and total energy intake (odds ratio, or, for highest quartile compared to lowest: 1.7 (95% confidence interval, ci, 1.0-3.0) for men, and 3.5 (95% ci 1.6-6.5) for women), fat intake (or for highest quartile compared to lowest: 1.9 (95% ci 1.1-3.5) for men, and 3.3 (95% ci 1.6-6.9) for women). for women, an effect was also seen for intake of carbohydrates (or for highest quartile compared to lowest: 3.2 (95% ci 1.5-6.8), while no protective effect was seen for vegetables or fruit. dairy products may be associated with risk of renal cell cancer (or for women using thickly spread butter compared to thinly spread: 11.4 (95% ci 2.8-45), or for women who drank more than one glass of milk with 3.5% fat content compared to never drink milk: 3.7 (95% ci 1.2-11). as expected, total energy intake, intake of fat, protein and carbohydrates were closely correlated making it difficult to identify one of the energy sources as more closely associated with risk of renal cell cancer than the other. several energy sources have been identified as possible risk factors for renal cell carcinoma. it is possible that a high energy intake as such rather than the individual sources are responsible for the increased risk. furthermore, dairy fats may be associated with renal cell carcinoma risk. the observed associations appeared stronger in women, and did not explain the association with obesity and low socio-economic status previously found in denmark.
involvement of eralpha and erbeta in estradiol-induced enhancement of hippocampal neurogenesis and sexual behaviour two hours following intraperitoneal injection, estradiol‐h3 is concentrated by cells in a system of limbic and hypothalamic structures. preoptic‐hypothalamic nuclei containing estrogen‐concentrating cells include the medial preoptic area, medial anterior hypothalamus, ventromedial nucleus, arcuate nucleus and ventral premammillary nucleus. limbic structures include the medial and cortical nuclei of the amygdala, lateral septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, diagonal band of broca, olfactory tubercle, ventral hippocampus, and prepiriform and entorhinal cortex. labelled cells were also found in the lateral and ventrolateral portions of the mesencephalic central grey. compared to these regions, most other regions of the nervous system, including the spinal cord, have very small numbers of labelled cells, which are relatively weakly labelled, and are not found in regular, specific locations. the distribution of estrogen‐concentrating cells determined with the present autoradiographic method agrees with previous autoradiographic conclusions and with biochemical results from cell fractionation experiments.
visualizing the endocytic and exocytic processes of wheat germ agglutinin by quantum dot-based single-particle tracking. the delivery of therapeutic agents to, or via, the oral cavity is limited by the efficient removal mechanisms that exist in this area. lectins are proteins or glycoproteins that bind to specific sugar residues, and can, therefore, interact with the glycoconjugates present on cell surfaces or salivary mucins. endogenous lectins could also be used as points of attachment for carbohydrate-containing delivery systems. this review considers the possibility of using lectins as targeting agents within the oral cavity and reports on some of the limited number of studies completed to date. as lectins are multifunctional molecules, the possibility of using them as both targeting and therapeutic agents is considered. lectin-containing delivery systems are a potential innovation for targeted and prolonged therapy within the oral cavity, but considerations such as toxicity and cost will need to be addressed before their routine use becomes a reality.
an application of a decision tree for assessing effects from exposures to multiple substances to the assessment of human and ecological effects from combined exposures to chemicals observed in surface waters and waste water effluents the threshold of toxicological concern (ttc) is a pragmatic risk assessment tool that is based on the principle of establishing a human exposure threshold value for all chemicals, below which there is a very low probability of an appreciable risk to human health. the concept that there are levels of exposure that do not cause adverse effects is inherent in setting acceptable daily intakes (adis) for chemicals with known toxicological profiles. the ttc principle extends this concept by proposing that a de minimis value can be identified for many chemicals, in the absence of a full toxicity database, based on their chemical structures and the known toxicity of chemicals which share similar structural characteristics. the establishment and application of widely accepted ttc values would benefit consumers, industry and regulators. by avoiding unnecessary toxicity testing and safety evaluations when human intakes are below such a threshold, application of the ttc approach would focus limited resources of time, cost, animal use and expertise on the testing and evaluation of substances with the greatest potential to pose risks to human health and thereby contribute to a reduction in the use of animals. an expert group of the european branch of the international life sciences institute-ilsi europe-has examined the ttc principle for its wider applicability in food safety evaluation. the expert group examined metabolism and accumulation, structural alerts, endocrine disrupting chemicals and specific endpoints, such as neurotoxicity, teratogenicity, developmental toxicity, allergenicity and immunotoxicity, and determined whether such properties or endpoints had to be taken into consideration specifically in a step-wise approach. the expert group concluded that the ttc principle can be applied for low concentrations in food of chemicals that lack toxicity data, provided that there is a sound intake estimate. the use of a decision tree to apply the ttc principle is proposed, and this paper describes the step-wise process in detail. proteins, heavy metals and polyhalogenated-dibenzodioxins and related compounds were excluded from this approach. when assessing a chemical, a review of prior knowledge and context of use should always precede the use of the ttc decision tree. the initial step is the identification and evaluation of possible genotoxic and/or high potency carcinogens. following this step, non-genotoxic substances are evaluated in a sequence of steps related to the concerns that would be associated with increasing intakes. for organophosphates a ttc of 18microg per person per day (0.3 microg/kg bw/day) is proposed, and when the compound is not an op, the ttc values for the cramer structural classes iii, ii and i, with their respective ttc levels (e.g. 1800, 540 and 90 microg per person per day; or 30, 9 and 1.5 microg/kg bw /day), would be applied sequentially. all other endpoints or properties were shown to have a distribution of no observed effect levels (noels) similar to the distribution of noels for general toxicity endpoints in cramer classes i, ii and iii. the document was discussed with a wider audience during a workshop held in march 2003 (see list of workshop participants).
micrornas enriched in hematopoietic stem cells differentially regulate long-term hematopoietic output to improve our ability to identify hematopoietic stem cells (hscs) and their localization in vivo, we compared the gene expression profiles of highly purified hscs and non-self-renewing multipotent hematopoietic progenitors (mpps). cell surface receptors of the slam family, including cd150, cd244, and cd48, were differentially expressed among functionally distinct progenitors. hscs were highly purified as cd150(+)cd244(-)cd48(-) cells while mpps were cd244(+)cd150(-)cd48(-) and most restricted progenitors were cd48(+)cd244(+)cd150(-). the primitiveness of hematopoietic progenitors could thus be predicted based on the combination of slam family members they expressed. this is the first family of receptors whose combinatorial expression precisely distinguishes stem and progenitor cells. the ability to purify hscs based on a simple combination of slam receptors allowed us to identify hscs in tissue sections. many hscs were associated with sinusoidal endothelium in spleen and bone marrow, though some hscs were associated with endosteum. hscs thus occupy multiple niches, including sinusoidal endothelium in diverse tissues.
adversity of prolonged extreme cold exposure among adult clients diagnosed with coronary artery diseases: a primer for recommending community health nursing intervention the potential health impacts of climate change are wide-ranging, from direct impacts at familiar local scales, through indirect effects occurring at the regional or ecosystem level, to long term effects on the sustainability of global systems. to assess these potential impacts, there is a need to broaden the scope of health impact assessment. eco-epidemiology is emerging as a response to this need. eco-epidemiology entails a shift in focus: from direct (toxicological) to indirect (ecological) mechanisms; and from effects occurring at 'human' temporal and geographical scales to those at regional and geophysical scales. we discuss the potential health impacts of climate change on each scale. at the global scale, interactions and feedbacks between systems are critical determinants of long term outcomes. from an eco-epidemiological perspective, the study of climate change becomes inseparable from the study of global change more generally.
evaluation of the reproductive toxicity of fungicide propiconazole in male rats. many pesticides are able to block or activate the steroid hormone receptors and/or to affect the levels of sex hormones, thereby potentially affecting the development or expression of the male and female reproductive system or both. this emphasizes the relevance of screening pesticides for a wide range of hormone-mimicking effects. twenty-two pesticides were tested for their ability to affect cyp19 aromatase activity in human placental microsomes using the classical [(3)h](2)o method. prochloraz, imazalil, propioconazole, fenarimol, triadimenol, triadimefon (all fungicides), and dicofol (an acaricide) gave rise to a statistically significant inhibition of aromatase activity. the ic(50)s of prochloraz, imazalil, propioconazole fenarimol, triadimenol, and triadimefon were calculated from dose-response curves to be 0.04, 0.34, 6.5, 10, 21 and 32 microm, respectively. the ic(50) of dicofol was greater than 50 microm. the positive control 4-hydroxyandrostendione (1 microm) caused an inhibition of aromatase activity by 74%. the compounds, which did not affect the aromatase activity, were bromopropylate, chlorfenvinphos, chlorobenzilate, chlorpyrifos, diuron, heptachlor, iprodion, linuron, pentachlorphenol, procymidon, propyzamide, quintozen, tetrachlorvinphos and tetradifon. with the purpose of comparing the results for fenarimol obtained with the microsomal system with data from an intact cell system, an aromatase assay based on jeg-3 cells was established. 4-hydroxyandrostendione (1 microm) inhibited the aromatase activity in jeg-3 cells by 94%. the ic(50) for fenarimol in this system was 2 microm, slightly lower than that observed in the microsomal system. for the first time, fenarimol has been demonstrated to inhibit aromatase activity in human tissues and, furthermore, propioconazole, triadimefon, and triadimenol were identified as weak aromatase inhibitors. in conclusion, seven out of 22 tested pesticides turned out to be weak to moderate aromatase inhibitors in vitro, indicating the relevance of elucidating the endocrine effects in vivo of these- compounds.
variance in prominence levels and in patterns of passing sequences in elite and youth soccer players: a network approach abstract the aim of this study was to propose a set of network methods to measure the specific properties of a team. these metrics were organised at macro-analysis levels. the interactions between teammates were collected and then processed following the analysis levels herein announced. overall, 577 offensive plays were analysed from five matches. the network density showed an ambiguous relationship among the team, mainly during the 2nd half. the mean values of density for all matches were 0.48 in the 1st half, 0.32 in the 2nd half and 0.34 for the whole match. the heterogeneity coefficient for the overall matches rounded to 0.47 and it was also observed that this increased in all matches in the 2nd half. the centralisation values showed that there was no ‘star topology’. the results suggest that each node (i.e., each player) had nearly the same connectivity, mainly in the 1st half. nevertheless, the values increased in the 2nd half, showing a decreasing participation of all players at the same level. briefly, these metrics showed that it is possible to identify how players connect with each other and the kind and strength of the connections between them. in summary, it may be concluded that network metrics can be a powerful tool to help coaches understand team’s specific properties and support decision-making to improve the sports training process based on match analysis.
stress-induced reinstatement of alcohol-seeking in rats is selectively suppressed by the neurokinin 1 (nk1) antagonist l822429 recent data indicate that alcohol dependence induces long-term neuroadaptations that recruit a negative emotional state. this leads to excessive alcohol ingestion motivated by relief of negative emotionality. a key mechanism in this transition to negative reinforcement is a recruitment of corticotropin-releasing factor (crf) signaling within the amygdala. long term upregulation of crf(1) receptors is observed in the amygdala following a history of dependence, and crf antagonists selectively block emotionality, excessive alcohol drinking and stress-induced reinstatement of alcohol-seeking in post-dependent animals. innate upregulation of crf(1) receptor expression mimics the post-dependent phenotype, both with regard to emotional responses and ethanol self-administration. therefore, the crf system is emerging as a key element of the neuroadaptive changes driving alcoholism and as a major target for its treatment.
a mutation in the suv39h2 gene in labrador retrievers with hereditary nasal parakeratosis (hnpk) provides insights into the epigenetics of keratinocyte differentiation to provide a stable environmental barrier, the epidermis requires an integrated network of cytoskeletal elements and cellular junctions. nevertheless, the epidermis ranks among the body's most dynamic tissues, continually regenerating itself and responding to cutaneous insults. as keratinocytes journey from the basal compartment towards the cornified layers, they completely reorganize their adhesive junctions and cytoskeleton. these architectural components are more than just rivets and scaffolds — they are active participants in epidermal morphogenesis that regulate epidermal polarization, signalling and barrier formation.
implementing oral care to reduce aspiration pneumonia amongst patients with dysphagia in a south african setting. swallowing musculature is asymmetrically represented in both motor cortices. stroke affecting the hemisphere with the dominant swallowing projection results in dysphagia and clinical recovery has been correlated with compensatory changes in the previously non-dominant, unaffected hemisphere. this asymmetric bilaterality may explain why up to half of stroke patients are dysphagic and why many will regain a safe swallow over a comparatively short period. despite this propensity for recovery, dysphagia carries a sevenfold increased risk of aspiration pneumonia and is an independent predictor of mortality. the identification, clinical course, pathophysiology, and treatment of dysphagia after stroke are discussed in this review.
overexpression of atogg1, a dna glycosylase/ap lyase, enhances seed longevity and abiotic stress tolerance in arabidopsis. repair of the ubiquitous mutagenic lesion 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxog) is initiated in eukaryotes by dna glycosylases/lyases, such as yeast ogg1, that do not share significant sequence identity with their prokaryotic counterparts, typified by escherichia coli mutm (fpg) protein. the unexpected presence of a functional mutm orthologue in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana has brought into question the existence of functional ogg1 orthologues in plants. we report here the cdna cloning, expression and functional characterization of atogg1, an arabidopsisthaliana gene widely expressed in different plant tissues which encodes a 40.3 kda protein with significant sequence identity to yeast and human ogg1 proteins. purified atogg1 enzyme specifically cleaves duplex dna containing an 8-oxog:c mispair, and the repair reaction proceeds through an imine intermediate characteristic of all bifunctional dna glycosylases/lyases. consistent with its in vitro activity, expression of atogg1 suppresses the mutator phenotype of an e. coli strain deficient in 8-oxog repair. our results suggest that atogg1 is an structural and functional homologue of ogg1 and establish the presence of two distinct 8-oxog repair enzymes in arabidopsis.
factors affecting 5- and 10-year survival of women with breast cancer: an analysis based on a public general hospital in barcelona. chemotherapy and hormone therapy prolong disease-free and overall survival for patients with breast cancer in the clinical-trial setting, but it is not clear if this translates into a benefit on a population basis. it is also not clear if surgical caseload has any influence on survival. we used cancer-registry data from 12,861 patients with breast cancer treated in yorkshire, uk, between 1979 and 1988, and found that patients of surgeons with higher rates of usage of chemotherapy and hormone therapy (regional mean usage 9.3%, range 0-46%) had prolonged survival. there was considerable variation in survival of breast cancer patients between surgeons, but their rate of use of chemotherapy and hormone therapy explained about 26% of this survival variation. had the practice of the surgeons with the better outcomes been used by all treating clinicians, 5-year survival would have increased by about 4-5%. examination of differences in survival as a function of consultant caseload demonstrated poorer results amongst those surgeons treating less than 30 new cases of breast cancer per year (risk ratio [95% ci] for treating > 30 compared with < 10 = 0.85 [0.77-0.93]). we recommend that patients with breast cancer be dealt with only by clinicians who see more than 30 new cases per year and who have a full range of treatment options available within a multidisciplinary setting.
verbal memory and visual perception in early alzheimer’s disease: contribution of new diagnostic tools for new classification criteria the free and cued selective reminding test (fcsrt) is a verbal episodic memory test used to identify patients with mild alzheimer's disease (ad). the present study investigates the relationships between performance on fcsrt and grey matter atrophy assessed with structural mri in patients with ad. three complementary mri-based analyses (vbm analysis, roi-based analysis, and three-dimensional hippocampal surface-based shape analysis) were performed in 35 patients with ad to analyze correlations between regional atrophy and their scores for episodic memory using the fcsrt. with vbm analysis, the total score on the fcsrt was correlated with left medial temporal lobe atrophy including the left hippocampus but also the thalami. in addition, using roi-based analysis, the total recall score on the fcsrt was correlated with the left hippocampal volume. with three-dimensional hippocampal surface-based shape analysis, both free recall and total recall scores were correlated with regions corresponding approximately to the ca1 field. no correlation was found with short term memory scores using any of these methods of analysis. in ad, the fcsrt may be considered as a useful clinical marker of memory disorders due to medial temporal damage, specially the ca1 field of the hippocampus.
adynamic bone decreases bone toughness during aging by affecting mineral and matrix backgroundbone mass, geometry, and tissue material properties contribute to bone structural integrity. thus, bone strength arises from both bone quantity and quality. bone quality encompasses the geometric and material factors that contribute to fracture resistance.questions/purposesthis review presents an overview of the methods for assessing bone quality across multiple length scales, their outcomes, and their relative advantages and disadvantages.methodsa pubmed search was conducted to identify methods related to bone mechanical testing, imaging, and compositional analysis. using various exclusion criteria, articles were selected for inclusion.resultsmethods for assessing mechanical properties include whole-bone, bulk tissue, microbeam, and micro- and nanoindentation testing techniques. outcomes include structural strength and material modulus. advantages include direct assessment of bone strength; disadvantages include specimen destruction during testing. methods for characterizing bone geometry and microarchitecture include quantitative ct, high-resolution peripheral quantitative ct, high-resolution mri, and micro-ct. outcomes include three-dimensional whole-bone geometry, trabecular morphology, and tissue mineral density. the primary advantage is the ability to image noninvasively; disadvantages include the lack of a direct measure of bone strength. methods for measuring tissue composition include scanning electron microscopy, vibrational spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, and chemical and physical analytical techniques. outcomes include mineral density and crystallinity, elemental composition, and collagen crosslink composition. advantages include the detailed material characterization; disadvantages include the need for a biopsy.conclusionsalthough no single method can completely characterize bone quality, current noninvasive imaging techniques can be combined with ex vivo mechanical and compositional techniques to provide a comprehensive understanding of bone quality.
magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound for uterine fibroids. one of the most recent additions to the methods for image-guided therapy is magnetic resonance (mr)-guided focused ultrasound. this method represents a unique closed-loop therapy, with planning, guidance, control, and direct feedback (called mr thermometry), which work together to ensure an effective therapy. the focused ultrasound induces focal tissue destruction by thermocoagulation in a noninvasive manner. mr also enables real-time thermometry to be performed during each and every sonication. these characteristics make mr-guided focused ultrasound an exciting new approach for treating fibroids. fibroids are diagnosed based on findings from the patient's physical examination supplemented by imaging results. mr imaging is preferred to other imaging modalities because it enables the fibroids and the entire pelvis to be fully examined. after individual fibroids are identified and the target area is defined by the radiologist, the target volume is analyzed in a three-dimensional assessment to ensure the patient's safety. the procedure begins with the delivery of low-power sonication, and the power is gradually increased until the therapeutic dose is reached. after the procedure, postcontrast images are acquired; these should demonstrate tissue necrosis. the results of clinical trials have shown that the treatment is safe, effective, and highly acceptable to patients.
a unique role of rgs9-2 in the striatum as a positive or negative regulator of opiate analgesia a subfamily of regulators of g protein signaling (rgs) proteins consisting of rgs6, -7, -9, and -11 is characterized by the presence of a unique ggamma-like domain through which they form obligatory dimers with the g protein subunit gbeta5 in vivo. in caenorhabditis elegans, orthologs of gbeta5.rgs dimers are implicated in regulating both galphai and galphaq signaling, and in cell-based assays these dimers regulate galphai/o- and galphaq/11-mediated pathways. however, initial studies with purified gbeta5.rgs6 or gbeta5.rgs7 showed that they only serve as gtpase activating proteins for galphao. pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation with these dimers failed to detect their binding to either galphao or galphaq, indicating that the interaction might require additional factors present in vivo. here, we asked if the rgs7.gbeta5 complex binds to galphaq using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (fret) in transiently transfected mammalian cells. rgs7, gbeta5, and galpha subunits were tagged with yellow variants of green fluorescent protein. first we confirmed the functional activity of the fusion proteins by co-immunoprecipitation and also their effect on signaling. second, we again demonstrate the interaction between rgs7 and gbeta5 using fret. finally, using both fret spectroscopy on cell suspensions and microscopy of individual cells, we showed fret between the yellow fluorescence protein-tagged rgs7.gbeta5 complex and cyan fluorescence protein-tagged galphaq, indicating a direct interaction between these molecules.
biphasic control logic of hamp domain signalling in the escherichia coli serine chemoreceptor regulation of the direction of flagellar rotation is central to the mechanism of bacterial chemotaxis. the transitions between counterclockwise and clockwise rotation are controlled by a "switch complex" composed of three proteins (flig, flim, and flin) and located at the base of the flagellar motor. the mechanism of function of the switch is unknown. here we demonstrate that the diffusible clockwise-signal molecule, the chey protein, binds to the switch, that the primary docking site is flim, that the extent of chey binding to flim is dependent upon the phosphorylation level of chey, and that it is unaffected by the other two switch proteins. this study provides a biochemical demonstration of binding of a signal molecule to the bacterial switch and demonstrates directly that phosphorylation regulates the activity of this molecule.
evaluation and analysis of data driven in expectation maximization segmentation through various initialization techniques in medical images an integration of a minimal spanning tree (mst) based graph-theoretic technique and expectation maximization (em) algorithm with rough set initialization is described for non-convex clustering. em provides the statistical model of the data and handles the associated uncertainties. rough set theory helps in faster convergence and avoidance of the local minima problem, thereby enhancing the performance of em. mst helps in determining non-convex clusters. since it is applied on gaussians rather than the original data points, time required is very low. these features are demonstrated on real life datasets. comparison with related methods is made in terms of a cluster quality measure and computation time.
precise regulation of gene expression dynamics favors complex promoter architectures information-carrying signals in the real world are often obscured by noise. a challenge for any system is to filter the signal from the corrupting noise. this task is particularly acute for the signal transduction network that mediates bacterial chemotaxis, because the signals are subtle, the noise arising from stochastic fluctuations is substantial, and the system is effectively acting as a differentiator which amplifies noise. here, we investigated the filtering properties of this biological system. through simulation, we first show that the cutoff frequency has a dramatic effect on the chemotactic efficiency of the cell. then, using a mathematical model to describe the signal, noise, and system, we formulated and solved an optimal filtering problem to determine the cutoff frequency that bests separates the low-frequency signal from the high-frequency noise. there was good agreement between the theory, simulations, and published experimental data. finally, we propose that an elegant implementation of the optimal filter in combination with a differentiator can be achieved via an integral control system. this paper furnishes a simple quantitative framework for interpreting many of the key notions about bacterial chemotaxis, and, more generally, it highlights the constraints on biological systems imposed by noise.
varicella zoster virus infection after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in children using a relatively short duration of acyclovir prophylaxis to evaluate the efficacy of long‐term prophylaxis with ultra‐low‐dose acyclovir against varicella‐zoster virus (vzv) reactivation, we analyzed the records of 242 japanese adult patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for the first time from 1995 to 2006 at our hospital. we started long‐term oral acyclovir at 200 mg/day in july 2001. acyclovir was continued until the end of immunosuppressive therapy and at least 1 year after transplantation. sixty‐six patients developed vzv reactivation at a median of 248 days after hsct, with a cumulative incidence of 34.7%. only one breakthrough reactivation occurred during long‐term acyclovir, which responded well to therapeutic dose of valacyclovir. the use of long‐term acyclovir was the only independent determinant that significantly decreased the overall incidence of vzv reactivation (20% vs. 50%, p < 0.0001). with this prophylaxis, visceral dissemination and serious complications other than post‐herpetic neuralgia was completely eliminated, and thereby need for hospitalization was significantly reduced (21% vs. 71%, p = 0.0034). fifteen of the 57 patients who discontinued acyclovir developed vzv reactivation, with a cumulative incidence of 32.1%. vzv reactivation following discontinuation tended to occur in patients who were receiving immunosuppressive therapy at the cessation of acyclovir. these findings suggested that long‐term prophylaxis of ultra‐low‐dose acyclovir resulted in a successful prevention of severe vzv‐related symptoms and death, with a significantly decreased overall incidence of vzv reactivation. prolongation of prophylactic acyclovir on profound immunosuppression might be important for thorough suppression of vzv reactivation. am. j. hematol., 2008. © 2008 wiley‐liss, inc.
nonstructural nipah virus c protein regulates both the early host proinflammatory response and viral virulence abstract we have generated a recombinant newcastle disease virus (ndv) that expresses the green fluorescence protein (gfp) in infected chicken embryo fibroblasts (cefs). this virus is interferon (ifn) sensitive, and pretreatment of cells with chicken alpha/beta ifn (ifn-α/β) completely blocks viral gfp expression. prior transfection of plasmid dna induces an ifn response in cefs and blocks ndv-gfp replication. however, transfection of known inhibitors of the ifn-α/β system, including the influenza a virus ns1 protein and the ebola virus vp35 protein, restores ndv-gfp replication. we therefore conclude that the ndv-gfp virus could be used to screen proteins expressed from plasmids for the ability to counteract the host cell ifn response. using this system, we show that expression of the ndv v protein or the nipah virus v, w, or c proteins rescues ndv-gfp replication in the face of the transfection-induced ifn response. the v and w proteins of nipah virus, a highly lethal pathogen in humans, also block activation of an ifn-inducible promoter in primate cells. interestingly, the amino-terminal region of the nipah virus v protein, which is identical to the amino terminus of nipah virus w, is sufficient to exert the ifn-antagonist activity. in contrast, the anti-ifn activity of the ndv v protein appears to be located in the carboxy-terminal region of the protein, a region implicated in the ifn-antagonist activity exhibited by the v proteins of mumps virus and human parainfluenza virus type 2.
role of nitric oxide mechanisms in control of pyloric motility and transpyloric flow of liquids in conscious dogs antropyloroduodenal motility was recorded in seven anesthetized dogs to assess the role of nitric oxide and l-arginine metabolites in nonadrenergic noncholinergic (nanc) mediation of pyloric relaxation. pyloric activity induced by duodenal field stimulation was inhibited by antral field stimulation and electrical vagal stimulation. intra-arterial ng-l-arginine-methyl-ester (l-name) reduced the inhibition from antral or vagal stimulation (p less than 0.05). intravenous infusion of l-name also blocked the inhibitory effect of vagal and antral stimulation but left the tetrodotoxin-insensitive action of intra-arterial vasoactive intestinal peptide (vip) and sodium nitroprusside unchanged. l-arginine reversed the effect of l-name whereas d-arginine did not. l-name enhanced pyloric contractions to intra-arterial acetylcholine. the nanc inhibition of the substance p-stimulated pyloric response in vitro was blocked by l-name and reversed by addition of l-arginine. sodium nitroprusside was effective as a relaxant in vitro but vip was not. these data suggest that metabolites of l-arginine mediate neural inhibition of canine pyloric motor activity.
wild bee nutritional ecology: predicting pollinator population dynamics, movement, and services from floral resources. global trends in pollinator-dependent crops have raised awareness of the need to support managed and wild bee populations to ensure sustainable crop production. provision of sufficient forage resources is a key element for promoting bee populations within human impacted landscapes, particularly those in agricultural lands where demand for pollination service is high and land use and management practices have reduced available flowering resources. recent government incentives in north america and europe support the planting of wildflowers to benefit pollinators; surprisingly, in north america there has been almost no rigorous testing of the performance of wildflower mixes, or their ability to support wild bee abundance and diversity. we tested different wildflower mixes in a spatially replicated, multiyear study in three regions of north america where production of pollinator-dependent crops is high: florida, michigan, and california. in each region, we quantified flowering among wildflower mixes composed of annual and perennial species, and with high and low relative diversity. we measured the abundance and species richness of wild bees, honey bees, and syrphid flies at each mix over two seasons. in each region, some but not all wildflower mixes provided significantly greater floral display area than unmanaged weedy control plots. mixes also attracted greater abundance and richness of wild bees, although the identity of best mixes varied among regions. by partitioning floral display size from mix identity we show the importance of display size for attracting abundant and diverse wild bees. season-long monitoring also revealed that designing mixes to provide continuous bloom throughout the growing season is critical to supporting the greatest pollinator species richness. contrary to expectation, perennials bloomed in their first season, and complementarity in attraction of pollinators among annuals and perennials suggests that inclusion of functionally diverse species may provide the greatest benefit. wildflower mixes may be particularly important for providing resources for some taxa, such as bumble bees, which are known to be in decline in several regions of north america. no mix consistently attained the full diversity that was planted. further study is needed on how to achieve the desired floral display and diversity from seed mixes.
molecular characterization of the trka/ngf receptor minimal enhancer reveals regulation by multiple cis elements to drive embryonic neuron expression. multipotential stem cells throughout the developing central nervous system have common properties. among these is expression of the intermediate filament protein nestin and the brain fatty acid binding protein (b-fabp). to determine if common mechanisms control transcription in cns stem cells, the regulatory elements of these two genes were mapped in transgenic mice. a 257 basepair enhancer of the rat nestin gene is sufficient for expression throughout the embryonic neuroepithelium. this enhancer contains two sites bound by the class iii pou proteins brn-1, brn-2, brn-4, and tst-1. only one of the two pou sites is required for cns expression. an adjacent hormone response element is necessary for expression in the dorsal midbrain and forebrain. the regulatory sites of the b-fabp gene are strikingly similar to those of the nestin gene. a hybrid pou/pbx binding site is recognized in vitro by pbx-1, brn-1 and brn-2. this site is essential for expression in most of the cns. in addition, a hormone response element is necessary for forebrain expression. both the nestin and b-fabp genes therefore depend on pou binding sites for general cns expression, with hormone response elements additionally required for activity in the anterior cns. these data indicate that regulation by pou proteins and hormone receptors is a general mechanism for cns stem cell-specific transcription.
a comparative study of orthotropic and isotropic bone adaptation in the femur in a companion paper, we presented a time‐dependent theory for bone modeling and remodeling in response to a daily loading history. this paper represents a preliminary attempt to use the theory to determine the distribution of bone density within the adult proximal femur under an assumed normal loading history. subsequent functional adaptation of the internal structure due to changes in the loading history are then determined. throughout this preliminary study, the external geometry of the proximal femur is considered to be fixed, i.e., changes in the external shape are neither stimulated nor allowed. linear and trilinear (dead‐zone nonlinearity) rate remodeling laws were compared. computer emulations using two‐dimensional finite element models were successful in creating a normal‐appearing distribution of bone tissue when remodeling was initiated from a solid structure of homogeneous bone density. subsequent reduction in the loading history caused regional bone atrophy. reinstatement of the normal loading history caused a generalized increase in bone mass but resulted in a slightly different bone distribution than was calculated for a constant loading history. these results demonstrate the utility of the remodeling theory and are consistent with the hypothesis that similar stress‐related phenomena are responsible for both normal morphogenesis and functional adaptiation in response to changes in the bone loading.
improved cross-section predictions for heavy charged higgs boson production at the lhc a bstractwe study the production of a higgs boson in association with bottom quarks in hadronic collisions, and present phenomenological predictions relevant to the 13 tev lhc. our results are accurate to the next-to-leading order in qcd, and matched to parton showers through the mc@nlo method; thus, they are fully differential and based on unweighted events, which we shower by using both herwig++ and pythia8. we perform the computation in both the four-flavour and the five-flavour schemes, whose results we compare extensively at the level of exclusive observables. in the case of the higgs transverse momentum, we also consider the analytically-resummed cross section up to the nnlo+nnll accuracy. in addition, we analyse at oαs3$$ \mathcal{o}\left({\alpha}_s^3\right) $$ the effects of the interference between the bb¯h$$ b\overline{b}h $$ and gluon-fusion production modes.
expression of cd81, sr‐bi and ldlr in lymphocytes and monocytes from patients with classic and occult hepatitis c virus infection hepatitis c virus (hcv) particles in serum associate with lipoproteins (lps), and the low-density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr) has been implicated in virus attachment and entry into cells. to clarify the basis of interactions between virus and lps, we determined whether hcv interacts with human lps via its envelope glycoprotein e2. the binding of serum-derived virus-like particles, hcv e2, and hcv e2-lp complexes to cd81 and ldlr was studied. incubation of hcv e2 protein with human and bovine lps (very low density, low density, and high density) enhanced the binding of both hcv e2 and lps to cd4+ lymphoblastoid (molt-4) cells, foreskin fibroblasts, and hepatocytes. the binding of hcv e2 to molt-4 cells was not enhanced when it was preincubated with lipid-free apoprotein b, which suggests that e2 interacts with the lipid moiety of human lipoproteins. the lp interaction was specific for hcv e2--incubation of hiv gp120 with lps did not enhance gp120 binding to molt-4 cells. the enhanced hcv e2 binding required expression of both human cd81 and ldlr. these data suggest that hcv e2 associates with ldl and that the resulting complex enhances binding of both ligands to cells, which may contribute to the finding that hcv-infected individuals have significantly lower levels of ldl than control subjects.
arachidonic acid-induced apoptosis in rat hepatoma as-30d cells is mediated by reactive oxygen species. arachidonic acid and, to a smaller extent, oleic acid at micromolar concentrations decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential within as-30d rat hepatoma cells cultivated in vitro and increased cell respiration. the uncoupling effect of both fatty acids on cell respiration was partly prevented by cyclosporin a, blocker of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. arachidonic acid increased the rate of reactive oxygen species (ros) production, while oleic acid decreased it. both fatty acids induced apoptotic cell death of as-30d cells, accompanied by the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol, activation of caspase-3 and association of proapoptotic bax protein with mitochondria; arachidonic acid being a more potent inducer than oleic acid. trolox, a potent antioxidant, prevented ros increase induced by arachidonic acid and protected the cells against apoptosis produced by this fatty acid. it is concluded that arachidonic and oleic acids induce apoptosis of as-30d hepatoma cells by the mitochondrial pathway but differ in the mechanism of their action: arachidonic acid induces apoptosis mainly by stimulating ros production, whereas oleic acid may contribute to programmed cell death by activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore.
identification of interlaminar fracture properties of a composite laminate using local full-field kinematic measurements and finite element simulations a new methodology is proposed to estimate displacement fields from pairs of images (reference and strained) that evaluates continuous displacement fields. this approach is specialized to a finite-element decomposition, therefore providing a natural interface with a numerical modeling of the mechanical behavior used for identification purposes. the method is illustrated with the analysis of portevin–le châtelier bands in an aluminum alloy sample subjected to a tensile test. a significant progress with respect to classical digital image correlation techniques is observed in terms of spatial resolution and uncertainty.
open treatment of femoroacetabular impingement is associated with clinical improvement and low complication rate at short-term followup background femoro-acetabular impingement has been associated with acetabular labral and/or articular cartilage damage that may ultimately result in osteoarthritis of the hip. surgical treatment of femoro-acetabular impingement is directed at restoring a more normal femoral head-neck offset to alleviate femoral abutment against the acetabular rim and treating associated labral and articular cartilage damage.   methods thirty hips with femoro-acetabular impingement (in twenty-nine patients) underwent débridement through a greater trochanteric flip osteotomy and anterior dislocation of the femoral head. there were sixteen male patients and thirteen female patients with a mean age of thirty-one years. cam (femoral based) impingement was noted in fourteen hips; pincer (acetabular based) impingement, in one hip; and combined cam and pincer impingement, in fifteen hips. the mean duration of clinical and radiographic follow-up was thirty-two months. all patients were followed according to a prospective protocol, with harris hip scores and plain radiographs obtained preoperatively and at six months, one year, and annually for a minimum of two years.   results the mean harris hip score improved from 70 points preoperatively to 87 points at the time of final follow-up (p < 0.0001). osteonecrosis did not develop in any hip, and there were no trochanteric nonunions. in eighteen hips, severe damage of the acetabular articular cartilage that had not been appreciated on preoperative plain radiographs or magnetic resonance arthrography was noted on arthrotomy. eight of these eighteen hips subsequently had radiographic evidence of progression of the osteoarthritis, and four of the eight hips required or were expected to soon require conversion to a total hip arthroplasty to treat progressive pain.   conclusions at the time of early follow-up, we found that surgical dislocation and débridement of the hip for the treatment of femoro-acetabular impingement in hips without substantial damage to the articular cartilage can reduce pain and improve function. this procedure has a low rate of complications. radiographic signs of progression of osteoarthritis and clinical failure requiring conversion to a total hip arthroplasty were seen only in patients with severe damage to the acetabular articular cartilage, a finding that emphasizes the need for better imaging methods to assess the extent of damage to the acetabular articular cartilage in patients with this disorder.
recurrence and quality of life following perineal proctectomy for rectal prolapse purpose: reports of outcome after surgery for rectal prolapse predominantly relate to single operative procedures. a single surgical operation is not appropriate for all patients with rectal prolapse. we describe a selective policy based on clinical criteria. methods: patients were offered surgery according to the following broad clinical protocol. those who were unfit for abdominal surgery had a perineal operation. the remainder had a suture abdominal rectopexy. a sigmoid resection was added for patients in whom incontinence was not a predominant symptom. results: surgery was performed in 159 patients. of these, 57 had a perineal operation, 65 had fixation rectopexy, and 37 had resection rectopexy. there were no in-hospital deaths, and major complications occurred in five patients (3.5 percent). minimum follow-up was 3 years. of the 143 patients with long-term follow-up, recurrence occurred in 7 (5 percent). constipation increased from 41 to 43 percent (59–61/143) and incontinence decreased from 43 to 19 percent (61 to 27/143). conclusions: a selective policy has improved outcome compared with reports of a single operation. future studies might consider an objective method of selecting the type of operation for rectal prolapse.
thiolase engineering for enhanced butanol production in clostridium acetobutylicum the primary alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase (coded by the aad gene) is responsible for butanol formation in clostridium acetobutylicum. we complemented the non-sporulating, non-solvent-producing c. acetobutylicum m5 strain (which has lost the psol1 megaplasmid containing aad and the acetone-formation genes) with aad expressed from the phosphotransbutyrylase promoter and restored butanol production to wild type levels. because no acetone was produced, no acids (acetate or butyrate) were re-assimilated leading to high butyrate but especially acetate levels. to counter acetate production, we examined thiolase overexpression in order reduce the acetyl-coa pool and enhance the butyryl-coa pool. we combined thiolase overexpression with aad overexpression aiming to also enhance butanol formation. while limiting the formation of acetate and ethanol, the butanol titers were not improved. we also generated acetate kinase (ak) and butyrate kinase (bk) knockout (ko) mutants of m5 using a modified protocol to increase the antibiotic-resistance gene expression. these strains exhibited greater than 60% reduction in acetate or butyrate formation, respectively. we complemented the akko m5 strain with aad overexpression, but could not successfully transform the bkko m5 strain. the akko m5 strain overexpressing aad produced less acetate, but also less butanol compared to the m5 aad overexpression strain. these data suggest that loss of the psol1 megaplasmid renders cells resistant to changes in the two acid-formation pathways, and especially so for butyrate formation. we argue that the difficulty in generating high butanol producers without acetone and acid production is hindered by the inability to control the electron flow, which appears to be affected by unknown psol1 genes.
toward understanding the dynamics of microbial communities in an estuarine system the metacommunity concept is an important way to think about linkages between different spatial scales in ecology. here we review current understanding about this concept. we first investigate issues related to its definition as a set of local communities that are linked by dispersal of multiple potentially interacting species. we then identify four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the species-sorting view, the mass effects view and the neutral view, that each emphasizes different processes of potential importance in metacommunities. these have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. we then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples. as ecologists strive to understand increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple scales of spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the metacommunity can provide important insights that frequently contrast with those that would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on local communities alone.
sulfated polysaccharide, curdlan sulfate, efficiently prevents entry/fusion and restricts antibody-dependent enhancement of dengue virus infection in vitro: a possible candidate for clinical application preclinical studies have shown that curdlan sulphate (crds), a sulphated 1-->3-beta-d glucan, inhibits plasmodium falciparum in vitro and down-modulates the immune response. a direct, non-specific effect on cytoadherence and rosetting may be predicted, as has been described with other sulphated polysaccharides, e.g. heparin. the anticoagulant effect of crds is 10-fold lower than heparin. curdlan sulphate has, therefore, emerged as a candidate for adjunct medication in the treatment of severe/cerebral malaria. two clinical studies were conducted using crds as adjunct medication to conventional therapy (artesunate) in patients with severe and severe/cerebral malaria. both studies were double-blind and placebo-controlled to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination. curdlan sulphate appeared to reduce the severity of the disease process, e.g. fever clearance time was shortened. due to the small number of patients, there was no difference in mortality. the two treatment arms in both studies showed similar results for all laboratory parameters. the only adverse event recorded during crds treatment was an increase in activated partial thromboplastin time. this can be monitored easily. it seems that the patients who may benefit most are severe/cerebral cases with no organ damage on admission.
why is my classifier discriminatory? algorithms are now regularly used to decide whether defendants awaiting trial are too dangerous to be released back into the community. in some cases, black defendants are substantially more likely than white defendants to be incorrectly classified as high risk. to mitigate such disparities, several techniques have recently been proposed to achieve algorithmic fairness. here we reformulate algorithmic fairness as constrained optimization: the objective is to maximize public safety while satisfying formal fairness constraints designed to reduce racial disparities. we show that for several past definitions of fairness, the optimal algorithms that result require detaining defendants above race-specific risk thresholds. we further show that the optimal unconstrained algorithm requires applying a single, uniform threshold to all defendants. the unconstrained algorithm thus maximizes public safety while also satisfying one important understanding of equality: that all individuals are held to the same standard, irrespective of race. because the optimal constrained and unconstrained algorithms generally differ, there is tension between improving public safety and satisfying prevailing notions of algorithmic fairness. by examining data from broward county, florida, we show that this trade-off can be large in practice. we focus on algorithms for pretrial release decisions, but the principles we discuss apply to other domains, and also to human decision makers carrying out structured decision rules.
persistence of fecal indicator bacteria in santa monica bay beach sediments. waters adjacent to the county of los angeles (ca) receive untreated runoff from a series of storm drains year round. many other coastal areas face a similar situation. to our knowledge, there has not been a large-scale epidemiologic study of persons who swim in marine waters subject to such runoff. we report here results of a cohort study conducted to investigate this issue. measures of exposure included distance from the storm drain, selected bacterial indicators (total and fecal coliforms, enterococci, and escherichia coli), and a direct measure of enteric viruses. we found higher risks of a broad range of symptoms, including both upper respiratory and gastrointestinal, for subjects swimming (a) closer to storm drains, (b) in water with high levels of single bacterial indicators and a low ratio of total to fecal coliforms, and (c) in water where enteric viruses were detected. the strength and consistency of the associations we observed across various measures of exposure imply that there may be an increased risk of adverse health outcomes associated with swimming in ocean water that is contaminated with untreated urban runoff.
humic acid decreases acute toxicity and ventilation frequency in eastern rainbowfish (melanotaenia splendida splendida) exposed to acid mine drainage. humic substances (hs) have been shown to decrease the toxicity of environmental stressors, but knowledge of their ability to influence the toxicity of multiple stressors such as metal mixtures and low ph associated with acid mine drainage (amd) is still limited. the present study investigated the ability of hs to decrease toxicity of amd to mayflies (atalophlebia spp.). the amd was collected from the mount morgan (mount morgan, queensland, australia) open pit. mayflies were exposed to concentrations of amd at 0%, 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4% in the presence of 0 mg/l, 10 mg/l, and 20 mg/l aldrich humic acid (aha). a u-shaped response was noted in all aha treatments, with higher rates of mortality recorded in the 2% and 3% dilutions compared with 4%. this result was linked with increased precipitates in the lower concentrations. a follow-up trial showed significantly higher concentrations of precipitates in the 2% and 3% amd dilutions in the 0 mg/l aha treatment and higher precipitates in the 2% amd, 10 mg/l and 20 mg/l aha, treatments. humic substances were shown to significantly increase survival of mayflies exposed to amd by up to 50% in the 20 mg/l aha treatment. humic substances may have led to increased survival after amd exposure through its ability to influence animal physiology and complex heavy metals. these results are valuable in understanding the ability of hs to influence the toxicity of multiple stressors.
gene‐by‐diet interactions influence calcium absorption and bone density in mice optimal intestinal calcium (ca) absorption is necessary for the protection of bone and the prevention of osteoporosis. ca absorption can be represented as the sum of a saturable pathway and a non-saturable pathway that is primarily dependent upon luminal ca concentration. while models have been proposed to describe these transport components, significant gaps still exist in our understanding of these processes. habitual low intake of ca up-regulates the saturable transport pathway, a process mediated by increased renal production of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin d (1,25(oh)2d). consistent with this, low vitamin d status as well as deletion/mutation of the vitamin d receptor (vdr) or 25 hydroxyvitamin d-1α hydroxylase (cyp27b1) genes limit ca absorption by reducing the saturable pathway. there is some evidence that non-saturable ca absorption in the ileum is also regulated by vitamin d status, but the mechanism is unclear. treatment with a number of hormones can regulate ca absorption in vivo (e.g. parathyroid hormone (pth), thyroid hormone, growth hormone (gh)/insulin-like growth factor i (igf-1), estrogen, testosterone). however, some of these actions are indirect (i.e. mediated through the regulation of vitamin d metabolism or signaling), whereas only a few (e.g. estrogen, igf-1) have been shown to persist in the absence of vitamin d signaling.
molecular differences between chronic and aggressive periodontitis jdr in recent years, molecular research has translated into remarkable changes for breast cancer diagnostics and therapeutics. molecular tests such as oncotype dx® and mammaprint® have revolutionized the predictive and prognostic tools in the clinic. by stratifying the risk of recurrence for patients, the tests are able to provide clinicians with more information on the treatment outcomes of using chemotherapy, endocrine therapy or combination therapies for patients with genetic expression patterns. however, it is still questionable for clinical applications as some areas remain unclear; the true benefit still needs prospective evaluation. in this paper, the limitation and the possibility to replace traditional histopathologic features of molecular tests are discussed. at the moment, it seems there are still limitations that prevent microarrays from replacing the microscope for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of early breast cancer. however, additional important clinical information is added to traditional histology and ihc determination of er, pr and her2 in terms of prognostic and predictive power.
the expression of lep, lepr, igf1 and il10 in obesity and the relationship with micrornas objectives: we investigated the effect of obesity on the serum levels of total and free igf-1 and their relationship to the circulating levels of insulin and igf binding proteins (igfbps) in age and sex-matched groups. subjects: the study included 43 obese subjects (ideal body weight; ibw>120%) and 45 controls (ibw<100%). all of the subjects were male. measurement: total igf-1, free igf-1, igfbp-1, igfbp-2, igfbp-3, and insulin were measured in obese subjects and normal control subjects. results: no significant differences in the circulating levels of total and igfbp-3 were observed between the obese and control groups. in contrast to total igf-1, free igf-1 in obese subjects was significantly increased compared to normal controls (p<0.05). serum total and free igf-1 were inversely correlated with age (r=−0.42, p=0.001, and −0.44, p=0.001). fasting serum insulin concentrations were elevated in all the obese subjects (p<0.05) and positively correlated with ibw (r=0.57, p=0.001). the levels of serum gh and igfbp-1 were suppressed in all the obese subjects (p<0.05). igfbp-1 was inversely correlated with ibw (r=−0.51, p=0.001) and serum insulin concentrations (r=minus;0.48, p=0.001). the igfbp-2 concentrations were also suppressed in obese subjects and inversely related to free igf-1 (r=−0.48, p=0.001). using multiple linear regression analysis, total igf-1 and insulin concentrations were positively correlated (r=0.58, p=0.001) and free igf-1 and igfbp-1 concentrations were negatively correlated (r=−0.57, p=0.001). conclusion: we confirmed that total igf-1 and igfbp-3 concentrations were not significantly different between the obese and control groups, despite gh hyposecretion in obesity. we also found that free igf-1 concentrations were higher in obese subjects than in normal controls. it seems likely that overnutrition and chronic hyperinsulinaemia in obesity may alter this regulated growth response by insulin stimulation of igf-1 production and suppression of hepatic igfbp-1 and igfbp-2 production, which may inhibit igf-1 bioactivity.
als-causing mutations significantly perturb the self-assembly and interaction with nucleic acid of the intrinsically disordered prion-like domain of tdp-43 glutamine/asparagine (q/n)-rich domains have a high propensity to form self-propagating amyloid fibrils. this phenomenon underlies both prion-based inheritance in yeast and aggregation of a number of proteins involved in human neurodegenerative diseases. to examine the prevalence of this phenomenon, complete proteomic sequences of 31 organisms and several incomplete proteomic sequences were examined for q/n-rich regions. we found that q/n-rich regions are essentially absent from the thermophilic bacterial and archaeal proteomes. moreover, the average q/n content of the proteins in these organisms is markedly lower than in mesophilic bacteria and eukaryotes. mesophilic bacterial proteomes contain a small number (0-4) of proteins with q/n-rich regions. remarkably, q/n-rich domains are found in a much larger number of eukaryotic proteins (107-472 per proteome) with diverse biochemical functions. analyses of these regions argue they have been evolutionarily selected perhaps as modular "polar zipper" protein-protein interaction domains. these data also provide a large pool of potential novel prion-forming proteins, two of which have recently been shown to behave as prions in yeast, thus suggesting that aggregation or prion-like regulation of protein function may be a normal regulatory process for many eukaryotic proteins with a wide variety of functions.
complete pathological response following neoadjuvant folfirinox in borderline resectable pancreatic cancer - a case report and review background pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (pda) has a very poor prognosis. treatment with folfirinox has been shown to improve outcomes, but can be associated with significant toxicity.   materials and methods a retrospective review was performed of all patients with locally advanced or metastatic pda treated with folfirinox at the royal marsden between november 2010 and november 2013. efficacy, tolerability, and potential prognostic factors were evaluated.   results twenty-seven patients with metastatic pda and 22 patients with locally advanced pda were treated with folfirinox. patients received a median of 9 cycles (range, 1-26) of folfirinox. the overall response rate was 41% (20 patients), and a further 17 patients (35%) had stable disease. thirty-five patients (71%) received folfirinox in the first-line setting, with a median progression-free survival and overall survival, respectively, of 12.9 months and 18.4 months for patients with locally advanced disease; and 8.4 months and 12.2 months for patients with metastatic disease. the most frequently occurring grade 3/4 toxicities were neutropenia (29%), fatigue (18%), febrile neutropenia (14%), thromboembolism (12%), and thrombocytopenia (10%). in a univariate analysis, reduction in ca 19-9 of >50% (p < .001), normalization of ca19-9 (p < .001), surgery after folfirinox (p = .004), and use of prophylactic pegfilgrastim (p = .005) were prognostic for overall survival.   conclusion the efficacy and tolerability of folfirinox for pda at our institution is similar to that reported in clinical trials. careful selection of patients and monitoring of response (according to ca19-9) and toxicities can help maximize advantage in this patient population.
reconsidering the income-illness relationship using distributional regression – an application to germany background. reliably mapping from generic or diseasespecific health status measures into health state utilities would assist health economists. existing studies mainly use ordinary least squares (ols) regression equations to predict utility values for particular health states. the authors examine an alternative approach tomap between 2 generic health status instruments, the sf-12 and the eq-5d. methods. multinomial logit regression is used to estimate the probability that a respondent will select a particular level of response to questions in the eq-5d, using individual question responses and summary scores from the sf-12 as predictors. monte carlo simulation methods are used to generate predicted eq-5d responses, and utility scores (tariffs) are then attached. results are comparedwithanalternativeapproach based on direct mapping to utility scores using ols. data. the authors estimate equations using 12,967 adult survey responses-from the 2000 us medical expenditure panel survey. they report mean squared error (mse) andmean absolute error (mae) of their predicted utilitieswithin this sample, and out-of-sample using 13,304 adults from the 1996 health survey for england. results. the authors obtain an in-sample and out-of-sample mse of 0.03, compared with 0.02 for the ols approach. their mae of 0.11 is similar to ols results. the authors’ method predicts groupmean utility scores and differentiates between groups with or without known existing illness. conclusions. the authors’ approach has higher mse than the direct ols approach but givesmore descriptive data on domains of health effects. further outofsample prediction work will help test the validity of these methods.
transformation of pollen embryo-derived explants by agrobacterium tumefaciens in hyoscyamus niger this work describes a new method to obtain transgenic somatic embryos fromagrobacterium-infected immature zygotic embryos ofdatura innoxia. it has several advantages over previous transformation methods such as the absence of a callus phase, an average transformation rate of 76% and a high regeneration frequency. critical steps for optimal transformation were the embryo stage and a short preculture treatment. the marker gene β-glucuronidase and light microscopy were used to identify the competent embryogenic cells which, after transformation, passed through the classical stages of embryo development. the transgenes were transmitted to the progeny in a mendelian fashion. the plants regenerated via direct somatic embryogenesis were cytologically and morphologically uniform. we also observed that: (1) wounding or wound-induced divisions were not required for zygotic embryo transformation; (2) epidermal cells were competent for both transformation and regeneration; and (3) competency foragrobacterium infection was developmental stage-specific. this new method should facilitate the development of new strategies to routinely transform recalcitrant plant species.
acute but not chronic stimulation of glial cells in rat spinal cord by systemic injection of lipopolysaccharide is associated with hyperalgesia the most characteristic feature of microglial cells is their rapid activation in response to even minor pathological changes in the cns. microglia activation is a key factor in the defence of the neural parenchyma against infectious diseases, inflammation, trauma, ischaemia, brain tumours and neurodegeneration. microglia activation occurs as a graded response in vivo. the transformation of microglia into potentially cytotoxic cells is under strict control and occurs mainly in response to neuronal or terminal degeneration, or both. activated microglia are mainly scavenger cells but also perform various other functions in tissue repair and neural regeneration. they form a network of immune alert resident macrophages with a capacity for immune surveillance and control. activated microglia can destroy invading micro-organisms, remove potentially deleterious debris, promote tissue repair by secreting growth factors and thus facilitate the return to tissue homeostasis. an understanding of intercellular signalling pathways for microglia proliferation and activation could form a rational basis for targeted intervention on glial reactions to injuries in the cns.
an empirical study of learning from imbalanced data we present a comprehensive suite of experimentation on the subject of learning from imbalanced data. when classes are imbalanced, many learning algorithms can suffer from the perspective of reduced performance. can data sampling be used to improve the performance of learners built from imbalanced data? is the effectiveness of sampling related to the type of learner? do the results change if the objective is to optimize different performance metrics? we address these and other issues in this work, showing that sampling in many cases will improve classifier performance.
proline‐rich acidic protein 1 (prap1) is a novel interacting partner of mad1 and has a suppressive role in mitotic checkpoint signalling in hepatocellular carcinoma motivation genes are often characterized dichotomously as either housekeeping or single-tissue specific. we conjectured that crucial functional information resides in genes with midrange profiles of expression.   results to obtain such novel information genome-wide, we have determined the mrna expression levels for one of the largest hitherto analyzed set of 62 839 probesets in 12 representative normal human tissues. indeed, when using a newly defined graded tissue specificity index tau, valued between 0 for housekeeping genes and 1 for tissue-specific genes, genes with midrange profiles having 0.15< tau<0.85 were found to constitute >50% of all expression patterns. we developed a binary classification, indicating for every gene the i(b) tissues in which it is overly expressed, and the 12-i(b) tissues in which it shows low expression. the 85 dominant midrange patterns with i(b)=2-11 were found to be bimodally distributed, and to contribute most significantly to the definition of tissue specification dendrograms. our analyses provide a novel route to infer expression profiles for presumed ancestral nodes in the tissue dendrogram. such definition has uncovered an unsuspected correlation, whereby de novo enhancement and diminution of gene expression go hand in hand. these findings highlight the importance of gene suppression events, with implications to the course of tissue specification in ontogeny and phylogeny.   availability all data and analyses are publically available at the genenote website, http://genecards.weizmann.ac.il/genenote/ and, geo accession gse803.   contact doron.lancet@weizmann.ac.il   supplementary information four tables available at the above site.
arbuscular mycorrhizal infection in two morphological root types of araucaria araucana (molina) k. koch. summaryroots of 76 plant species collected in west spitsbergen (svalbard), in the middle-northern arctic zone, were examined for mycorrhiza and root-associated fungi. dryas octopetala, pedicularis dasyantha and salix polaris were ectomycorrhizal and cassiope tetragona and empetrum hermaphroditum ericoid mycorrhizal. pedicularis dasyantha was only slightly infected. structures resembling vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (vam) fungi were not found in the roots, and soil samples screened for vam fungi contained only one spore. root endophytic fungi commonly occurred in spits-bergen, but only olpidium brassicae, pleospora herbarum, papulaspora, microdochium bolleyi and rhizoctonia solani were identified with reasonable certainty. a sterile endophytic dark-septate fungus (dsf) was in 39.5% of the flowering-plant species examined, especially in the brassicaceae, caryophyllaceae, saxifragaceae and poaceae. dsf were categorized into four slightly overlapping groups. sterile endophytic hyaline septate fungi were rare. in the literature it is suggested that at least some of the dsf species or the hyaline septate fungi are functionally mutualistic rather than saprophytic or pathogenic. the literature on ectomycorrhizal fungi and plants in spitsbergen is reviewed, including about 50 species, mainly of the genera cortinarius, hebeloma, inocybe, laccaria, lactarius and russula. these are symbiotic with the above-mentioned ectomycorrhizal plants. four further ectomycorrhizal plants (betula nana, salix spp.) are very rare in the area.
budding yeast cdc6p induces re-replication in fission yeast by inhibition of scfpop-mediated proteolysis p25rum1 from the fission yeast s. pombe is shown to act as a specific in vitro inhibitor of the p34cdc2/p56cdc13 mitotic kinase. it is also shown that early g1 cells contain p25rum1, which associates with and inhibits the mitotic kinase, and maintains p56cdc13 mitotic b cyclin at a low level, ensuring that these cells do not undergo a premature lethal entry into mitosis. a high level of p25rum1 in g2 cells inhibits the p34cdc2/p56cdc13 kinase that removes the block preventing a further s phase and leads to repeated rounds of dna replication. thus, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p25rum1, acting on the p34cdc2 mitotic kinase, plays an important role in ensuring the correct sequence of s phase and mitosis during the cell cycle.
weekly screening supports terminating nosocomial transmissions of vancomycin-resistant enterococci on an oncologic ward – a retrospective analysis abstract infections attributable to vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) strains have become increasingly prevalent over the past decade. prompt identification of colonized patients combined with effective multifaceted infection control practices can reduce the transmission of vre and aid in the prevention of hospital-acquired infections (hais). increasingly, the clinical microbiology laboratory is being asked to support infection control efforts through the early identification of potential patient or environmental reservoirs. this review discusses the factors that contribute to the rise of vre as an important health care-associated pathogen, the utility of laboratory screening and various infection control strategies, and the available laboratory methods to identify vre in clinical specimens.
predictors of health worker performance after integrated management of childhood illness training in benin: a cohort study objectives to prepare for the implementation of integrated management of childhood illness (imci) in benin, we studied the management of ill children younger than 5 years at outpatient health facilities.   methods we observed a representative sample of consultations; after each consultation, we interviewed caregivers and reexamined children. health workers' performance was evaluated against imci guidelines. to identify determinants of performance, statistical modeling was performed and 6 focus groups with health workers were conducted to solicit their opinions.   results altogether, 584 children were enrolled and 101 health workers were observed; 130 health workers participated in focus group discussions. many serious deficiencies were found: incomplete assessment of children's signs and symptoms, incorrect diagnosis and treatment of potentially life-threatening illnesses, inappropriate prescription of dangerous sedatives, missed opportunities to vaccinate, and failure to refer severely ill children for hospitalization. quantitative and qualitative analyses showed various health facility-, health worker-, caregiver-, and child-related factors as possible determinants of health worker performance.   conclusions action is urgently needed. our results suggest that to improve health care delivery, interventions should target both the health system and the community level.
on reconfigurable tiled multi-core programming: processing cores evaluation parallel computing teaching has an important difficulty, there are few tools to directly learn the behavior of the parallel algorithms and the parallel architectures. normally the student is formed to think in sequential algorithms running in sequential machines. we present psee, a tool to reduce the gap between the basic concepts and its utilization. psee is an integrated and interactive graphic environment which allows to simulate and evaluate the performance of parallel algorithms in parallel architectures. psee permits to manage the main characteristic parameters involved in the system in order to show the tuning grade of the algorithm/architecture couple. psee includes a graphic editor for algorithms and architectures in modelled form, an interactive simulator to run (simulate) the algorithm on the architecture and a performance evaluation instrument.
effect of exogenous lysine on the expression of early cephamycin c biosynthetic genes and antibiotic production in nocardia lactamdurans ma4213 abstractl-lysine is known to stimulate production of β-lactam antibiotics bystreptomyces clavuligerus via provision of the lysine breakdown product,l-α-aminoadipic acid, which is a limiting precursor. previous investigations utilized levels of 10–20 mml-lysine as an addition to chemically-defined media resulting in 50–100% improvement in antibiotic production. we were surprised to note that as the concentration was further increased, the organism responded by producing even higher titers of antibiotics. the optimum concentration of 100 mml-lysine yielded an approximate 500% increase in production with only minor effects on growth.dl- andd-lysine also exerted enhancements suggesting the presence of a lysine racemase or some other route fromd-lysine tol-α-aminoadipate in this organism;d-lysine was considerably less potent thandl- orl-lysine.
is there diurnal variation of the vestibulosympathetic reflex: implications for orthostatic hypotension. melatonin has been reported to decrease nerve activity of medial vestibular nuclei in the rat and is associated with attenuated muscle sympathetic nerve activity (msna) responses to baroreceptor unloading in humans. the purpose of this study was to determine if melatonin alters the vestibulosympathetic reflex (vsr) and vestibulocollic reflex (vcr) in humans. in study 1, msna, arterial blood pressure, and heart rate were measured in 12 healthy subjects (28 ± 1 yr; 6 men, 6 women) during head-down rotation (hdr) before and 45 min after ingestion of either melatonin (3 mg) or placebo (sucrose). subjects returned at least 2 days later at the same time of day to repeat the trial after ingesting the opposite treatment (melatonin or placebo). melatonin significantly attenuated msna responses during hdr compared with placebo (burst frequency δ 4 ± 1 vs. δ 7 ± 1 bursts/min, and total msna δ 51 ± 20 and δ 96 ± 15%, respectively; p < 0.02). in study 2, vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (vemp) were measured in 10 healthy subjects (26 ± 1 yr; 4 men and 6 women) before and after ingestion of 3 mg melatonin. melatonin did not alter the timing of the p13 and n23 peaks (pre-melatonin 13.2 ± 0.4 and 21.3 ± 0.6 ms vs. post-melatonin 13.5 ± 0.4 and 21.4 ± 0.7 ms, respectively) or the p13-n23 interpeak amplitudes [pre-melatonin 22.5 ± 4.6 arbitrary units (au) and post-melatonin 22.7 ± 4.6 au]. in summary, melatonin attenuates the vsr and supports the concept that melatonin negatively affects orthostatic tolerance. however, melatonin does not alter the vcr in humans suggesting melatonin's effect on the vsr appears to be mediated by the utricles.
degree of conversion of nano-hybrid resin-based composites with novel and conventional matrix formulation objective the objective of this study was to compare the microstructures of teeth, natural opals, and opal dental enamel porcelains to examine the mechanisms that cause opalescence.   method and materials four dental porcelains, a natural opal mineral, and a human tooth were examined. replicas were assessed in transmission electron microscopy for features that would cause opalescence. enamel dental porcelains denoted as "light" were selected for the study. x-ray diffraction and color analyses of the porcelains were also performed.   results all the materials were opalescent, to varying degrees. the porcelains with fewer microscopic features were less opalescent. the presence of dispersed particles or a phase-separated glass was found to cause opalescence in dental porcelains.   conclusion a phase-separated glass in one enamel porcelain best resembled the microstructure of natural opal mineral and teeth, and this was the most "opalescent" material.
endospore surface properties of commonly used bacillus anthracis surrogates vary in aqueous solution this study was designed to elucidate the influence of spore properties such as the presence of an exosporium, on their ability to adhere to materials. this analysis was performed on 17 strains belonging to the b. cereus group and to less related bacillus species. we first demonstrated that spores of the b. cereus group, surrounded by an exosporium, differed in their morphological features such as exosporium size, number of appendages or hair-like nap length. we also found that the saccharidic composition of exosporium differed among strains, e.g. concerning a newly identified rhamnose derivative: the 2,4-o-dimethyl-rhamnose. conversely, spores of distant bacillus species shared morphological and physico-chemical properties with b. cereus spores. some external features were also observed on these spores, such as a thin loose-fitting layer, whose nature is still to be determined, or a thick saccharidic layer (mainly composed of rhamnose and quinovose). the ability of spores to adhere to stainless steel varied among strains, those belonging to the b. cereus group generally being the most adherent. however, the presence of an exosporium is not sufficient to explain the ability of spores to adhere to inanimate surfaces. indeed, when the 17 strains were compared, hydrophobicity and the number of appendages were the only significant adhesion parameters. furthermore, the differences in spore adhesion observed within the b. cereus group were related to differences in the number of appendages, the exosporium length and to a lesser extent, the zeta potential.
nitric oxide and cyclic gmp induce vesicle release at drosophila neuromuscular junction. nitric oxide is generated by a ca2+/calmodulin‐stimulated nitric oxide synthase and activates soluble guanylyl cyclase. using nadph diaphorase (nadphd) staining as a marker for the enzyme nitric oxide synthase and an antiserum against cgmp, we investigated the cellular organization of nitric oxide donor and target cells in olfactory pathways of the brain of the locust (schistocerca gregaria). a small subset of neuronal and glial cells expressed cgmp immunoreactivity after incubation of tissue in a nitric oxide donor. nitric oxide‐induced increases in cgmp immunoreactivity were quantified in a tissue preparation of the antennal lobe and in primary mushroom body cell cultures. the mushroom body neuropil is a potential target of a transcellular nitric oxide/ cgmp messenger system since it is innervated by extrinsic nadphd‐positive neurons. the mushroom body‐intrinsic kenyon cells do not stain for nadphd but can be induced to express cgmp immunoreactivity. the colocalization of nadphd and cgmp immunoreactivity in a cluster of interneurons of the antennal lobe, the principal olfactory neuropil of the insect brain, suggests a role of the nitric oxide/cgmp system in olfactory sensory processing. colocalization of nadphd staining and cgmp immunoreactivity was also found in certain glial cells. the cellular organization of the nitric oxide/cgmp system in neurons and glia raises the possibility that nitric oxide acts not only as an intercellular but also as an intracellular messenger molecule in the insect brain.
visual tracking using an insect vision embedded particle filter recent years have seen greater interest in the use of discriminative classifiers in tracking systems, owing to their success in object detection. they are trained online with samples collected during tracking. unfortunately, the potentially large number of samples becomes a computational burden, which directly conflicts with real-time requirements. on the other hand, limiting the samples may sacrifice performance.    interestingly, we observed that, as we add more and more samples, the problem acquires circulant structure. using the well-established theory of circulant matrices, we provide a link to fourier analysis that opens up the possibility of extremely fast learning and detection with the fast fourier transform. this can be done in the dual space of kernel machines as fast as with linear classifiers. we derive closed-form solutions for training and detection with several types of kernels, including the popular gaussian and polynomial kernels. the resulting tracker achieves performance competitive with the state-of-the-art, can be implemented with only a few lines of code and runs at hundreds of frames-per-second. matlab code is provided in the paper (see algorithm 1).
running head : guessing in change detection 1 informed guessing in change detection here we examine a new task to assess working memory for visual arrays in which the participant must judge how many items changed from a studied array to a test array. as a clue to processing, on some trials in the first 2 experiments, participants carried out a metamemory judgment in which they were to decide how many items were in working memory. trial-to-trial fluctuations in these working memory storage judgments correlated with performance fluctuations within an individual, indicating a need to include trial-to-trial variation within capacity models (through either capacity fluctuation or some other attention parameter). mathematical modeling of the results achieved a good fit to a complex pattern of results, suggesting that working memory capacity limits can apply even to judgments that involve an entire array rather than just a single item that may have changed, thus providing the expected conscious access to at least some of the contents of working memory.
supporting aspartate biosynthesis is an essential function of respiration in proliferating cells reprogramming of cellular metabolism is an emerging hallmark of neoplastic transformation. however, it is not known how the expression of metabolic genes in tumors differs from that in normal tissues, or whether different tumor types exhibit similar metabolic changes. here we compare expression patterns of metabolic genes across 22 diverse types of human tumors. overall, the metabolic gene expression program in tumors is similar to that in the corresponding normal tissues. although expression changes of some metabolic pathways (e.g., upregulation of nucleotide biosynthesis and glycolysis) are frequently observed across tumors, expression changes of other pathways (e.g., oxidative phosphorylation) are very heterogeneous. our analysis also suggests that the expression changes of some metabolic genes (e.g., isocitrate dehydrogenase and fumarate hydratase) may enhance or mimic the effects of recurrent mutations in tumors. on the level of individual biochemical reactions, many hundreds of metabolic isoenzymes show significant and tumor-specific expression changes. these isoenzymes are potential targets for anticancer therapy.
social experience in 10-year-old children born with a cleft: exploring psychosocial resilience the objective of this study was to determine whether variation in psychological adjustment to physically disfiguring conditions is related to organisation of the content of appearance-related information in the self-concept. a cross-sectional design was employed, using 70 participants with a range of appearance problems recruited from support groups and the nhs. a postal paper and pencil task was completed by participants which assessed the level of their adjustment using the derriford appearance scale, and measured the three self-concept variables – differential importance, compartmentalisation and complexity. regression analyses showed that poor adjustment to disfigurement is related to greater differential importance of appearance-related self-aspects, greater compartmentalisation of appearance-related information and greater self-concept complexity. no moderating effects were found between these independent variables. the results have implications for psychological treatment strategies, particularly cognitive behavioural therapeutic interventions.
evidence for peroxynitrite as a signaling molecule in flow-dependent activation of c-jun nh2-terminal kinase. shear stress differentially regulates production of many vasoactive factors at the level of gene expression in endothelial cells that may be mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinases, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) and n-terminal jun kinase (jnk). here we show, using bovine aortic endothelial cells (baec), that shear stress differentially regulates erk and jnk by mechanisms involving gi2 and pertussis toxin (ptx)-insensitive g-protein-dependent pathways, respectively. shear activated erk with a rapid, biphasic time course (maximum by 5 min and basal by 30-min shear exposure) and force dependence (minimum and maximum at 1 and 10 dyn/cm2 shear stress, respectively). ptx treatment prevented shear-dependent activation of erk1/2, consistent with a gi-dependent mechanism. in contrast, jnk activity was maximally turned on by a threshold level of shear force (0.5 dyn/cm2 or higher) with a much slower and prolonged time course (requiring at least 30 min to 4 h) than that of erk. also, ptx had no effect on shear-dependent activation of jnk. to further define the shear-sensitive erk and jnk pathways, vectors expressing hemagglutinin epitope-tagged erk (ha-erk) or ha-jnk were co-transfected with other vectors by using adenovirus-polylysine in baec. expression of the mutant αi2(g203), antisense gαi2 and a dominant negative ras (n17ras) prevented shear-dependent activation of ha-erk, while that of αi2(g204) and antisense αi3 did not. expression of a gβ/γ scavenger, the carboxyl terminus of β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βark-ct), and n17ras inhibited shear-dependent activation of ha-jnk. treatment of baec with genistein prevented shear-dependent activation of erk and jnk, indicating the essential role of tyrosine kinase(s) in both erk and jnk pathways. these results provide evidence that 1) gi2-protein, ras, and tyrosine kinase(s) are upstream regulators of shear-dependent activation of erk and 2) that shear-dependent activation of jnk is regulated by mechanisms involving gβ/γ, ras, and tyrosine kinase(s).
the role of macrophages in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative pathways of alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis: pathogenetic cellular effectors and potential therapeutic targets pu.1 is a member of the ets family of transcription factors and is expressed exclusively in cells of the hematopoietic lineage. mice homozygous for a disruption in the pu.1 dna binding domain are born alive but die of severe septicemia within 48 h. the analysis of these neonates revealed a lack of mature macrophages, neutrophils, b cells and t cells, although erythrocytes and megakaryocytes were present. the absence of lymphoid commitment and development in null mice was not absolute, since mice maintained on antibiotics began to develop normal appearing t cells 3–5 days after birth. in contrast, mature b cells remained undetectable in these older mice. within the myeloid lineage, despite a lack of macrophages in the older antibiotic‐treated animals, a few cells with the characteristics of neutrophils began to appear by day 3. while the pu.1 protein appears not to be essential for myeloid and lymphoid lineage commitment, it is absolutely required for the normal differentiation of b cells and macrophages.
review of bortezomib treatment of antibody-mediated rejection in renal transplantation. plasma cells provide humoral immunity. they have traditionally been viewed mainly as short-lived end-stage products of b-cell differentiation that deserve little interest. this view is changing, however, because we now know that plasma cells can survive for long periods in the appropriate survival niches and that they are an independent cellular component of immunological memory. studies of the biology of plasma cells reveal a mechanism of intriguing simplicity and elegance that focuses memory provided by plasma cells on recently encountered pathogens while minimizing the 'fading' of memory for pathogens encountered in the distant past. this mechanism is based on competition for survival niches between newly generated plasmablasts and older plasma cells.
active contextual entropy search contextual policy search is a reinforcement learning approach for multi-task learning in the context of robot control learning. it can be used to learn versatilely applicable skills that generalize over a range of tasks specified by a context vector. in this work, we combine contextual policy search with ideas from active learning for selecting the task in which the next trial will be performed. moreover, we use active training set selection for reducing detrimental effects of exploration in the sampling policy. a core challenge in this approach is that the distribution of the obtained rewards may not be directly comparable between different tasks. we propose the novel approach pubsve for estimating a reward baseline and investigate empirically on benchmark problems and simulated robotic tasks to which extent this method can remedy the issue of non-comparable reward.
gaussian multiple-access relay channels with non-causal side information at the transmitters we extend shannon's result on the capacity of channels with state information to multiple user channels. more specifically, we characterize the capacity (region) of degraded broadcast channels and physically degraded relay channels where the channel state information is causally available at the transmitters. we also obtain inner and outer bounds on the capacity region for multiple access channels with causal state information at the transmitters
relationship between circulating syndecan-1 levels (cd138s) and serum free light chains in monoclonal gammopathies significance exosome-mediated intercellular transfer of proteins and nucleic acids has attracted considerable attention as exosomes may promote the development of cancer and other pathological conditions; however, the mechanism of exosome uptake by target cells and how this may be inhibited remain as important questions. we provide evidence that heparan sulfate proteoglycans (hspgs) function as receptors of cancer cell-derived exosomes. importantly, our data indicate that the hspg-dependent uptake route is highly relevant for the biological activity of exosomes, and thus a potential target for inhibition of exosome-mediated tumor development. given that several viruses have previously been shown to enter cells through hspgs, our data implicate hspg as a convergence point during cellular uptake of endogenous vesicles and virus particles. extracellular vesicle (ev)-mediated intercellular transfer of signaling proteins and nucleic acids has recently been implicated in the development of cancer and other pathological conditions; however, the mechanism of ev uptake and how this may be targeted remain as important questions. here, we provide evidence that heparan sulfate (hs) proteoglycans (pgs; hspgs) function as internalizing receptors of cancer cell-derived evs with exosome-like characteristics. internalized exosomes colocalized with cell-surface hspgs of the syndecan and glypican type, and exosome uptake was specifically inhibited by free hs chains, whereas closely related chondroitin sulfate had no effect. by using several cell mutants, we provide genetic evidence of a receptor function of hspg in exosome uptake, which was dependent on intact hs, specifically on the 2-o and n-sulfation groups. further, enzymatic depletion of cell-surface hspg or pharmacological inhibition of endogenous pg biosynthesis by xyloside significantly attenuated exosome uptake. we provide biochemical evidence that hspgs are sorted to and associate with exosomes; however, exosome-associated hspgs appear to have no direct role in exosome internalization. on a functional level, exosome-induced erk1/2 signaling activation was attenuated in pg-deficient mutant cells as well as in wt cells treated with xyloside. importantly, exosome-mediated stimulation of cancer cell migration was significantly reduced in pg-deficient mutant cells, or by treatment of wt cells with heparin or xyloside. we conclude that cancer cell-derived exosomes use hspgs for their internalization and functional activity, which significantly extends the emerging role of hspgs as key receptors of macromolecular cargo.
influence of zearalenone on selected biochemical parameters in juvenile rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss). bisphenol a (bpa), an estrogenic environmental contaminant is also known for oxidative stress-inducing effect. malnutrition is recognized as a confounding factor in oxidative stress. however, little is known about effect of malnutrition on oxidative stress induced by bpa or other endocrine disrupting chemicals (edcs). we studied effect of malnutrition (iron deficiency) in rats chronically exposed to low levels of bpa taking into consideration the oxidative stress and antioxidant status in liver, kidney and gonads. iron deficiency significantly elevated level of lipid peroxidation in bpa-exposed rats. similarly, decrease in reduced glutathione level was more significant in rats maintained on iron deficient diet compared to those maintained on normal diet. iron deficiency also significantly modulated activities of vital antioxidant enzymes in all the tissues. female rats showed more vulnerability than males to iron-deficiency modulated effects of bpa on the above parameters. this study demonstrated that malnutrition, especially iron deficiency, might act as a confounding factor in edc-induced oxidative stress. however, more studies may be needed to confirm effect of nutritional factors on estrogenic activity of bpa or other edcs.
analysis of hoxd-13 and hoxd-11 misexpression in chick limb buds reveals that hox genes affect both bone condensation and growth. replication-competent avian retroviruses, capable of transducing and expressing up to 2 kb of nonviral sequences, are now available to effect widespread gene transfer in chicken (chick) embryos (s. h. hughes, j. j. greenhouse, c. j. petropoulos, and p. sutrave, j. virol. 61:3004-3012, 1987). we have constructed novel avian retroviral vectors that encode human placental alkaline phosphatase as a marker whose expression can be histochemically monitored. these vectors have been tested for expression by introducing them into the embryonic chick nervous system. they have revealed that the expression of retrovirally transduced genes can be spatially and temporally limited without the need for tissue-specific promoters. by varying the site and time of infection, targeted gene transfer can be confined to selected populations of neural cells over the course of several days, a time window that is sufficient for many key developmental processes. the capability of differentially infecting specific target populations may avoid confounding variables such as detrimental effects of a transduced gene on processes unrelated to the cells or tissue of interest. these vectors and methods thus should be useful in studies of the effect of transduced genes on the development of various organs and tissues during avian embryogenesis. in addition, the vectors will facilitate studies aimed at an understanding of viral infection and expression patterns.
environmental pcb exposure and risk of endometriosis. 17 beta-estradiol (e2) induces cathepsin d mrna levels and intracellular levels of immunoreactive protein in mcf-7 human breast cancer cells. 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (tcdd) alone does not affect cathepsin d gene expression in this cell line; however, in cells cotreated with tcdd and e2, tcdd inhibited e2-induced cathepsin d mrna levels, the rate of gene transcription, and levels of immunoreactive protein. the inhibitory responses were observed within 30 to 120 min after the cells were treated with tcdd. tcdd also inhibited e2-induced secreted alkaline phosphatase activity in aryl hydrocarbon (ah)-responsive mcf-7 and wild-type mouse hepa 1c1c7 cells cotransfected with the human estrogen receptor (her) and the pbc12/s1/pac plasmid, which contains the 5' promoter region (-296/+57) of the cathepsin d gene and an alkaline phosphatase reporter gene. the e2-responsive er/sp1 sequence (-199 to -165) in the cathepsin d 5' region contains an imperfect gtgcgtg (-175/-181) xenobiotic responsive element (xre); the role of this sequence in ah responsiveness was investigated in gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays and with plasmid constructs containing a wild-type er/sp1 oligonucleotide or a mutant er/sp1-"xre" oligonucleotide containing two c-->a mutations in the xre sequence (antisense strand). in plasmid constructs which contained a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene and the wild-type er/sp1 promoter sequence, e2-induced chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity and mrna levels were inhibited by tcdd whereas no inhibition was observed with the mutant er/sp1-"xre" plasmids. electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the nuclear or transformed cytosolic ah receptor complex blocked formation of the er-sp1 complex with the wild-type but not the er/sp1 mutant oligonucleotide. moreover, incubation of the wild-type bromodeoxyuridine-substituted er/sp1 oligonucleotide with the nuclear ah receptor complex gave a specifically bound cross-linked 200-kda band. these data demonstrate that ah receptor-mediated inhibition of e2-induced cathepsin d gene expression is due to disruption of the er-sp1 complex by targeted interaction with an overlapping xre.
synchronous contralateral adrenal metastasis of colorectal cancer: case report integrated fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (pet)-computed tomography (ct) for adrenal gland imaging in cancer patients allows early detection and accurate localization of adrenal lesions and differentiation of metastatic nodules from benign lesions, thereby facilitating treatment planning. however, false-positive findings are encountered at integrated pet-ct in approximately 5% of adrenal lesions identified as positive at pet, including adrenal adenomas, adrenal endothelial cysts, and inflammatory and infectious lesions. moreover, false-negative findings may be seen in adrenal metastatic lesions with hemorrhage or necrosis, small-sized (<10-mm) metastatic nodules, and metastases from pulmonary bronchioloalveolar carcinoma or carcinoid tumors. an awareness of the potential pitfalls of integrated pet-ct enhances the diagnostic efficacy of this modality by allowing differentiation of metastatic adrenal lesions from other abnormalities.
cancer-specific perk signaling drives invasion and metastasis through creb3l1 oasis is a transcription factor similar to atf6 that is activated by endoplasmic reticulum stress. in this study we investigated the expression of oasis in human glioma cell lines and the effect of oasis knock-down on the er stress response and cell migration. oasis mrna was detected in three distinct glioma cell lines (u373, a172 and u87) and expression levels were increased upon treatment with er stress-inducing compounds in the u373 and u87 lines. oasis protein, which is glycosylated on asn-513, was detected in the u373 and u87 glioma lines at low levels in control cells and protein expression was induced by er stress. knock-down of oasis in human glioma cell lines resulted in an attenuated unfolded protein response to er stress (reduced grp78/bip and grp94 induction) and decreased expression of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan extracellular matrix proteins, but induction of the collagen gene col1a1 was unaffected. cells in which oasis was knocked-down exhibited altered cell morphology and reduced cell migration. these results suggest that oasis is important for the er stress response and maintenance of some extracellular matrix proteins in human glioma cells.
poly-victimization and its association with protective and vulnerability variables in adolescence: the mediating role of self-esteem youths who have been maltreated often experience symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd), and this special population has received increased attention from researchers. pathways toward maladaptive effects of maltreatment and ptsd are remarkably similar and reflect specific biological diatheses and psychological vulnerabilities that produce wide-ranging self-regulation deficits. developmental models of effects of maltreatment and of ptsd are thus increasingly intertwined and have begun to inform specialized assessment and treatment strategies for this population. this review covers key aspects of posttraumatic stress disorder in maltreated youth, including epidemiology, symptomatology, outcome, and risk factors as well as assessment and treatment strategies and challenges for these youths.
hepatocyte dusp14 maintains metabolic homeostasis and suppresses inflammation in the liver dusps (dual-specificity phosphatases) are a heterogeneous group of protein phosphatases that can dephosphorylate both phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/phosphothreonine residues within the one substrate. dusps have been implicated as major modulators of critical signalling pathways that are dysregulated in various diseases. dusps can be divided into six subgroups on the basis of sequence similarity that include slingshots, prls (phosphatases of regenerating liver), cdc14 phosphatases (cdc is cell division cycle), ptens (phosphatase and tensin homologues deleted on chromosome 10), myotubularins, mkps (mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases) and atypical dusps. of these subgroups, a great deal of research has focused on the characterization of the mkps. as their name suggests, mkps dephosphorylate mapk (mitogen-activated protein kinase) proteins erk (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase), jnk (c-jun n-terminal kinase) and p38 with specificity distinct from that of individual mkp proteins. atypical dusps are mostly of low-molecular-mass and lack the n-terminal ch2 (cdc25 homology 2) domain common to mkps. the discovery of most atypical dusps has occurred in the last 6 years, which has initiated a large amount of interest in their role and regulation. in the past, atypical dusps have generally been grouped together with the mkps and characterized for their role in mapk signalling cascades. indeed, some have been shown to dephosphorylate mapks. the current literature hints at the potential of the atypical dusps as important signalling regulators, but is crowded with conflicting reports. the present review provides an overview of the dusp family before focusing on atypical dusps, emerging as a group of proteins with vastly diverse substrate specificity and function.
mental capital and wellbeing : making the most of ourselves in the 21 st century stakeholder engagement background the present study examined associations between alcohol involvement in early to middle adolescence and neuropsychological (np) functioning.   methods alcohol-dependent adolescents (n = 33) with over 100 lifetime alcohol episodes and without dependence on other substances were recruited from alcohol/drug abuse treatment facilities. comparison (n = 24) adolescents had no histories of alcohol or drug problems and were matched to alcohol-dependent participants on age (15 to 16 years), gender, socioeconomic status, education, and family history of alcohol dependence. np tests and psychosocial measures were administered to alcohol-dependent participants following 3 weeks of detoxification.   results alcohol-dependent and comparison adolescents demonstrated significant differences on several np scores. protracted alcohol use was associated with poorer performance on verbal and nonverbal retention in the context of intact learning and recognition discriminability. recent alcohol withdrawal among adolescents was associated with poor visuospatial functioning, whereas lifetime alcohol withdrawal was associated with poorer retrieval of verbal and nonverbal information.   conclusions deficits in retrieval of verbal and nonverbal information and in visuospatial functioning were evident in youths with histories of heavy drinking during early and middle adolescence.
parents' talk about letters with their young children. two studies were performed to determine whether children's experiences with their own names boost their knowledge about the components of the name, the letters. the children in study one showed a significant superiority for the initial letter of their own first name in tests of letter-name, but not letter-sound, knowledge. this pattern was found for australian first graders (mean age 5 years, 5 months), u.s. kindergartners (mean age 5 years, 8 months), and u.s. preschoolers (mean age 4 years, 10 months). study two, with u.s. preschoolers (mean age 4 years, 11 months), again revealed an advantage for the initial letter of a child's first name in knowledge of letter names but not knowledge of letter sounds. moreover, the children were better at printing the initial letter of their own first name than other letters. the results show that different factors are involved in the learning of letter names and letter sounds. they further suggest that children use letter-based strategies with their own names at a time when they are often considered to be "logographic" readers.
integrated role of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis supplementation in gut microbiota, immunity, and metabolism of infant rhesus monkeys exposure to a strong t-helper 2 (th2)-like environment during fetal development may promote allergy development. increased cord blood (cb) levels of the th2-associated chemokine ccl22 were associated with allergy development during the first 2 y of life. the aim of the present study was to determine whether cb th1- and th2-associated chemokine levels are associated with allergy development during the first 6 y of life, allowing assessment of respiratory allergic symptoms usually developing in this period. the cb levels of cytokines, chemokines, and total ige were determined in 56 children of 20 women with allergic symptoms and 36 women without allergic symptoms. total ige and allergen-specific ige antibody levels were quantified at 6, 12, 24 mo, and 6 y of age. increased cb ccl22 levels were associated with development of allergic sensitization and asthma and increased ccl17 levels with development of allergic symptoms, including asthma. sensitized children with allergic symptoms showed higher cb ccl17 and ccl22 levels and higher ratios between these th2-associated chemokines and the th1-associated chemokine cxcl10 than nonsensitized children without allergic symptoms. a pronounced th2 deviation at birth, reflected by increased cb ccl17 and ccl22 levels, and increased ccl22/cxcl10 and ccl17/cxcl10 ratios might promote allergy development later in life.
spatial behavior: the impact of global and local geometry exploration in a dark open field undergoes three progressive changes: (i) an initial phase of spending equal amounts of time in various zones of the arena changes to staying in the corners, and ultimately spending most of the time in one corner; (ii) travel paths are first circular and scattered all over the arena, but gradually become anchored to one corner at which they start and end; (iii) traveled distance gradually decreases to that of the initial level seen in a lit open field. altogether, rodents shift from a 'looping' exploration mechanism with feeble coupling with the environment, to 'home base' exploration which is firmly anchored to the environment. this shift also involves switching from momentary and sporadic to repeated returns to a specific, presumably familiar place, to which the animal navigates back from various other places. we suggest that this switching illustrates navigation first by directional and then by positional environmental cues, as hypothesized in the 'parallel map theory'. we also suggest that the transition from looping to home base behavior is part of a hierarchal construction of space representation via three modes of spatial information processing: (i) piloting--sequential processing, based on moving from one landmark to the next; (ii) orienting--parallel processing, based on moving from one point to the next, with the same starting and ending point; (iii) navigating--continuous processing, based on continuously updating the position in relation to several locations in the environment (map navigation).
temporal viral genome-protein interactions define distinct stages of productive herpesviral infection herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) infects over half the human population. much of the infectious cycle occurs in the nucleus of cells where the virus has evolved mechanisms to manipulate host processes for the production of virus. the genome of hsv-1 is coordinately expressed, maintained, and replicated such that progeny virions are produced within 4–6 hours post infection. in this study, we selectively purify hsv-1 replication forks and associated proteins from virus-infected cells and identify select viral and cellular replication, repair, and transcription factors that associate with viral replication forks. pulse chase analyses and imaging studies reveal temporal and spatial dynamics between viral replication forks and associated proteins and demonstrate that several dna repair complexes and key transcription factors are recruited to or near replication forks. consistent with these observations we show that the initiation of viral dna replication is sufficient to license late gene transcription. these data provide insight into mechanisms that couple hsv-1 dna replication with transcription and repair for the coordinated expression and maintenance of the viral genome.
laser-supported partial laparoscopic nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma without ischaemia time objectives the extirpation of peripherally seated renal tumors by partial nephrectomy is an established method. to decrease the disadvantages of vascular hilar clamping, we proved the use of a laser for partial nephrectomy. to date, this laser application has only been described in the animal model.   methods with an exophytic position of the renal tumor, we successfully performed nephron-sparing surgery without clamping of the renal vessels in 5 patients.   results regular ultrasound monitoring showed no evidence of postoperative hemorrhage. the serum creatinine, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were nearly unaltered before and after surgery.   conclusions the results of our study have shown that laser-supported partial nephrectomy without clamping of the renal vessels, particular in carefully selected patients, is a safe alternative to classic partial nephrectomy.
opposite effects of weak transcranial direct current stimulation on different phases of short interval intracortical inhibition (sici) short-interval intracortical inhibition (sici) is a widely used method to study cortical inhibition, and abnormalities have been found in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. previous studies suggested that sici involves two phases and the first phase may be explained by axonal refractoriness. our objectives are to further investigate the mechanisms of the two phases of sici. sici was studied in 11 normal volunteers by a paired transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms) paradigm applied to the left motor cortex with a subthreshold conditioning stimulus (80% resting motor threshold for rest condition and 95% active motor threshold for active condition) followed by a suprathreshold test stimulus at interstimulus intervals (isis) of 1–4.5 ms in steps of 0.5 ms. motor-evoked potentials (meps) were recorded from the right first dorsal interosseous muscle. three different test stimulus intensities adjusted to produce 0.2, 1 and 4 mv meps at rest were studied with the target muscle relaxed and during 20% maximum contraction. maximum inhibition was observed at isis of 1 ms and 2.5 ms for the rest condition and the difference among isis was reduced with voluntary contraction. sici increased with larger test mep amplitude and decreased with voluntary contraction. at test mep of 0.2 mv, some subjects showed facilitation and this is likely related to short-interval intracortical facilitation. for rest sici, the correlation between adjacent isis was much higher from 3 to 4.5 ms than from 1 to 2.5 ms or between 1 and 2.5 ms. there was no correlation between sici at different test mep amplitudes. we conclude that maximum sici at isis of 1 and 2.5 ms are mediated by different mechanisms. sici at 1 ms cannot be fully explained by axonal refractoriness and synaptic inhibition may be involved. sici is a complex phenomenon and inhibition at different isis may be mediated by different inhibitory circuits.
magnetic resonance imaging of shoulder arthroplasty total shoulder arthroplasty, originally used by pean in 1893 to treat tuberculous arthritis1 and subsequently modernized by neer et al. in the 1950s for the treatment of three and four-part proximal humeral fractures2, has demonstrated clinical efficacy when used for the treatment of primary and secondary degenerative conditions of the shoulder. the overall number of shoulder replacements has increased in parallel to the total number of total joint arthroplasties. approximately 7000 total shoulder replacements were performed annually in the united states from 1996 through 2002. this represents a 40% increase compared with the 5000 arthroplasties per year performed from 1990 through 19923-11. despite the increase in the annual volume of shoulder arthroplasties, data have suggested that nearly three-fourths of the operations are performed by surgeons who do two or fewer procedures a year12,13. the favorability of the clinical outcomes of total shoulder arthroplasty as well as the decision to proceed with a total shoulder replacement instead of a hemiarthroplasty have been shown to depend on surgeon experience and hospital volume12-16. patient readmission rates, complication rates, and lengths of hospital stays have all been shown to …
prospective evaluation of the learning curve of fertiloscopy with and without ovarian drilling. study objective to prospectively analyze the learning curve of laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (lavh) in a surgical team and evaluate if length of surgery can be reduced safely.   design prospective observational study (canadian task force classification ii-2).   setting department of obstetrics and gynecology in a university-affiliated hospital.   patients one hundred and sixty consecutive women undergoing lavh performed between january 1, 1998 and april 30, 2001.   intervention lavh (aagl classification system for laparoscopic hysterectomy iii-b-3).   measurements and main results the primary parameter evaluated was length of surgery. patients were grouped in cohorts of 10, in order to perform a time curve that would assist us in evaluation of the learning process. once the plateau was reached, we evaluated the process before and after this plateau (groups 1 [learning stage] and 2 [second stage], respectively). average length of surgery was 126 minutes (range, 60-260). length of surgery was 138 minutes (range, 75-260) in the learning stage (first 80 cases) and 112 minutes (range, 60-225) in the second stage (p <.0001). total rate of complications was 11.6%. there were three major complications, and they occurred before the plateau. there were 15 minor complications (9.67%), 8 during the first stage and 7 in the second stage, (p =.9; ns). a second learning curve excluding lavh with associated surgeries was obtained. the average length of surgery for the first stage was 133 minutes (range, 75-205) and 102 minutes for the second stage (range, 60-130) (p >.0001).   conclusion analysis of the learning curve demonstrated that the length of surgery in lavh could be reduced without increasing the number of complications.
connexins are mechanosensitive. gap junction channels are formed by members of the connexin gene family and mediate direct intercellular communication through linked hemichannels (connexons) from each of two adjacent cells. while for most connexins, the hemichannels appear to require an apposing hemichannel to open, macroscopic currents obtained from xenopus oocytes expressing rat cx46 suggested that some hemichannels can be readily opened by membrane depolarization [paul, d. l., ebihara, l., takemoto, l. j., swenson, k. i. & goodenough, d. a. (1991), j. cell biol. 115, 1077-1089]. here we demonstrate by single channel recording that hemichannels comprised of rat cx46 exhibit complex voltage gating consistent with there being two distinct gating mechanisms. one mechanism partially closes cx46 hemichannels from a fully open state, gammaopen, to a substate, gammasub, about one-third of the conductance of gammaopen; these transitions occur when the cell is depolarized to inside positive voltages, consistent with gating by transjunctional voltage in cx46 gap junctions. the other gating mechanism closes cx46 hemichannels to a fully closed state, gammaclosed, on hyperpolarization to inside negative voltages and has unusual characteristics; transitions between gammaclosed and gammaopen appear slow (10-20 ms), often involving several transient substates distinct from gammasub. the polarity of activation and kinetics of this latter form of gating indicate that it is the mechanism by which these hemichannels open in the cell surface membrane when unapposed by another hemichannel. cx46 hemichannels display a substantial preference for cations over anions, yet have a large unitary conductance (approximately 300 ps) and a relatively large pore as inferred from permeability to tetraethylammonium (approximately 8.5 angstroms diameter). these hemichannels open at physiological voltages and could induce substantial cation fluxes in cells expressing cx46.
the risk of monozygotic twins after assisted reproductive technology: a systematic review and meta-analysis. objective the purpose of our study is to compare the occurrence of monozygotic twinning (mzt) from blastocyst transfer (bt) in our program between an earlier and more recent time period.   design retrospective.   setting academic ivf practice.   patient(s) all pregnancies conceived between march 2002 and december 2005 (n = 932) in our program were compared to pregnancies conceived before march 2002 (n = 554), which were the subject of a previous study.   intervention(s) none.   main outcome measure(s) the incidence of mzt with day 3 embryo transfer and bt were compared between the study and control groups.   result(s) during the study period, the rate of mzt was not significantly different for bt at 2.3% (9/385) compared to day 3 embryo transfer at 1.8% (10/547). this rate of 2.3% for bt was significantly lower than the rate of 5.6% (11/197) reported at our institution for bt before march 2002.   conclusion(s) our study suggests that the risk of mzt with bt is significantly lower in the more recent time period and is in the range of what is seen with cleavage stage transfer. it is likely that improvements in culture systems as experience is gained with bt played a role.
the rab7 gtpase controls the maturation of salmonella typhimurium‐containing vacuoles in hela cells rab gtpases belong to the ras gtpase superfamily and are key regulators of membrane traffic. among them, rab7 has been localized on late endosomes of nrk cells but its function remains unknown. in order to investigate its role, we generated stable hela cell lines that express either wild type or a gtpase-defective mutant of rab7 in an inducible manner. a morphological analysis of the intracellular localization of these proteins was performed by confocal laser microscopy. here we show that, in hela cells, rab7 is present on a vesicular compartment that extends from the perinuclear area to the cell periphery and shows only a partial colocalization with the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor, a marker for late endosomes. the topology of this compartment is dependent on the microtubule network since nocodazole treatment results in its scattering throughout the cytoplasm. in addition, we observed that, in contrast to the wild-type protein, a rab7 mutant with a reduced gtpase activity is in part associated with lysosomal membranes. this observation was confirmed by subcellular fractionation in a percoll gradient. our data implicate rab7 as the first gtpase functioning on terminal endocytic structures in mammalian cells.
microbial community structure at different fermentation stages of kutajarista, a herbal formulation abstract bombyx mori l. (lepidoptera: bombycidae) have been domesticated and widely used for silk production. it feeds on mulberry leaves. mulberry leaves are mainly composed of pectin, xylan, cellulose and starch. some of the digestive enzymes that degrade these carbohydrates might be produced by gut bacteria. eleven isolates were obtained from the digestive tract of b. mori, including the gram positive bacillus circulans and gram negative proteus vulgaris, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, serratia liquefaciens, enterobacter sp., pseudomonas fluorescens, p. aeruginosa, aeromonas sp., and erwinia sp.. three of these isolates, p. vulgaris, k. pneumoniae, c. freundii, were cellulolytic and xylanolytic, p. fluorescens and erwinia sp., were pectinolytic and k. pneumoniae degraded starch. aeromonas sp. was able to utilize the cmcellulose and xylan. s. liquefaciens was able to utilize three polysaccharides including cmcellulose, xylan and pectin. b. circulans was able to utilize all four polysaccharides with different efficacy. the gut of b. mori has an alkaline ph and all of the isolated bacterial strains were found to grow and degrade polysaccharides at alkaline ph. the number of cellulolytic bacteria increases with each instar.
use of weekly assessment data to enhance evaluation of a subjective wellbeing intervention the timing (spacing) of assessments is an important component of longitudinal research. the purpose of the present study is to determine methods of timing the collection of longitudinal data that provide better parameter recovery in mixed effects nonlinear growth modeling. a simulation study was conducted, varying function type, as well as the number of measurement occasions, in order to examine the effect of timing on the accuracy and efficiency of parameter estimates. the number of measurement occasions was associated with greater efficiency for all functional forms and was associated with greater accuracy for the intrinsically nonlinear functions. in general, concentrating measurement occasions toward the left or at the extremes was associated with increased efficiency when estimating the intercepts of intrinsically linear functions, and concentrating values where the curvature of the function was greatest generally resulted in the best recovery for intrinsically nonlinear functions. results from this study can be used in conjunction with theory to improve the design of longitudinal research studies. in addition, an r program is provided for researchers to run customized simulations to identify optimal sampling schedules for their own research.
nonlinear contractions and semigroups in complete fuzzy metric spaces where \p is some function defined on the closure of the range of p. in [3], rakotch proved that if \p(t) =ct(t)t, where a is decreasing and a(t) <1 for i>0, then a mapping satisfying (3) has a unique fixed point x0. it is an easy exercise to show that if \p(t) =a(t)t, where a is increasing, and a(/)<l for t^o, then the conclusion of banach's theorem still holds. we shall show that one need only assume that ip(t) <t for ¿>0, together with a semicontinuity condition on \[/. for a metrically convex space, even this latter condition may be dropped. a number of examples are given to show that the results do in fact improve upon those mentioned above. we wish to thank the referee for suggesting the improved version of theorem 1 which is presented in this paper. we begin with some preliminary results on metrically convex spaces. definition 1 [l, p. 41]. a metric space x is said to be metrically convex if for each x, yex, there is a z^x, y for which p(x, y) =p(x, z) +p(z, y)-
monocyte tissue factor-dependent activation of coagulation in hypercholesterolemic mice and monkeys is inhibited by simvastatin. objective—anti-inflammatory effects of statins contribute to their clinical benefit. molecular mechanisms underlying these effects have not been well explored. because statins attenuate lipopolysaccharide (lps) responsiveness, we hypothesized that part of the pleiotropic effects are mediated through innate immunity. methods and results—toll-like receptor (tlr) 4 expression and downstream signaling in cd14+ monocytes after incubation with simvastatin and atorvastatin were quantified via flow-cytometry, quantitative rt-pcr, kinase assay, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. incubation with intermediates/ inhibitors of the mevalonate pathway was used to identify the mode of statin action. statin incubation resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of tlr4 expression (53±7.6% reduction compared with untreated monocytes; p<0.005), transcript levels (68±6.3%; p<0.002), decreased irak phosphorylation (37±8.3%; p<0.05), and lps-induced il-6, il-12, tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-&agr;, and b7-1 expression (p<0.05). four weeks of treatment with atorvastatin significantly reduced tlr4 expression on circulating cd14+ monocytes by 36.2±4.2% (p<0.05). effects of statins were reversed by mevalonate (p=0.57). incubation with specific inhibitors of geranylgeranyltransferase (54±4.3%), farnesyltransferase (57±5.1%), or with clostridium-difficile toxin b (58±6.1%, p<0.01) imitated the statin effects. whereas wortmannin and ly294002 inhibited the statin effect (p=0.27), incubation with a specific rhoa kinase inhibitor had no effect (p=0.57). conclusions—statins influence tlr4 expression and signaling via inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation and farnesylation. these observations imply interactions with innate immunity as one pleiotropic mechanism.
effects of electrical stimulation on meat quality of lamb and goat meat our study examined high and low voltage electrical stimulation and postmortem storage as strategies to improve tenderness and lean color in cabrito carcasses. boer cross (n=60) kids were assigned to either high (550 v), low (20 v), or no electrical stimulation treatments. no differences in muscle temperature were observed between treatments at any time measured. muscle ph declined fastest in high voltage treated carcasses. high voltage electrical stimulation slightly increased (p<0.05) b (∗) and a (∗) in the m. gluteus medius and tended to increase l (∗) and b (∗) (p=0.06 and 0.11, respectively) values in the m. longissimus thoracis. electrical stimulation had no effect on myofibril fragmentation at 1-, 3-, or 14-d postmortem or sarcomere length. high voltage electrical stimulation increased (p<0.05) tenderness at 1- and 3-d postmortem, but not at 14-d postmortem. aging for 3 d did not affect tenderness regardless of stimulation treatment, but aging time for 14 d improved (p<0.05) tenderness. these data indicate that high voltage electrical stimulation and 14 d aging were effective in improving the tenderness of meat from cabrito carcasses.
a preliminary near-infrared spectroscopy study in adolescent and adult patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms near-infrared spectroscopy (nirs) is an optical imaging method, which allows non-invasive in vivo measurements of changes in the concentration of oxygenated (o2hb) and deoxygenated (hhb) haemoglobin in cortical tissue. for the present study, we examined 13 adult adhd patients and 13 age- and gender-matched healthy controls by means of multi-channel nirs (optical topography; etg-100, hitachi medical co., japan) during performance of a working memory (n-back) paradigm. compared to the healthy control group, adhd patients showed reduced task-related increases in the concentration of o2hb in nirs channels located over the ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex, indicating reduced activation during performance of the n-back task in this part of the brain. this finding was particularly apparent for the task condition with high working memory load (2-back), and was accompanied by a statistical trend towards an increased number of omission errors in the patient group. the data confirm previous findings of working memory deficits and prefrontal cortex dysfunction in patients suffering from adhd, and are discussed in the light of imaging findings and theoretical models of working memory function.
linear discriminant analysis achieves high classification accuracy for the bold fmri response to naturalistic movie stimuli pattern recognition methods have shown that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) data can reveal significant information about brain activity. for example, in the debate of how object categories are represented in the brain, multivariate analysis has been used to provide evidence of a distributed encoding scheme [science 293:5539 (2001) 2425-2430]. many follow-up studies have employed different methods to analyze human fmri data with varying degrees of success [nature reviews 7:7 (2006) 523-534]. in this study, we compare four popular pattern recognition methods: correlation analysis, support-vector machines (svm), linear discriminant analysis (lda) and gaussian naïve bayes (gnb), using data collected at high field (7 tesla) with higher resolution than usual fmri studies. we investigate prediction performance on single trials and for averages across varying numbers of stimulus presentations. the performance of the various algorithms depends on the nature of the brain activity being categorized: for several tasks, many of the methods work well, whereas for others, no method performs above chance level. an important factor in overall classification performance is careful preprocessing of the data, including dimensionality reduction, voxel selection and outlier elimination.
synergistic therapeutic effects of a tumor targeting antibody fragment, fused to interleukin 12 and to tumor necrosis factor alpha. the potential of specifically targeting antineoplastic drugs and toxins to tumors with the use of monoclonal antibodies (moabs) reactive with tumor-associated antigens is currently being examined. n-acetyl-melphalan-moab (n-acmel-moab) conjugates have previously been shown to have greater antitumor activity than n-acmel, melphalan, or moab alone against both subcutaneous and ascites murine thymomas in mice (1). although this conjugate is also a highly selective tumor inhibitor in vitro, it may not reach all the tumor cells in a high concentration, and consequently larger tumors (greater than 0.4 cm2) cannot be eradicated. this conjugate is representative of many drug-moab conjugates in that they are unable to gain adequate access to the tumor site to exert their cytotoxic effect. to potentiate the antitumor effect of the n-acmel-moab conjugate, studies were undertaken to analyze its action in combination with recombinant human tumor necrosis factor alpha (rtnf-alpha), a monokine, capable of causing acute necrosis of syngeneic tumor transplants in mice. treatment of mice with murine thymomas (0.4 to 0.6 cm2 in size) demonstrated that 30% of the tumors in mice receiving conjugate and rtnf-alpha partially or completely regressed, while no regressions were observed in the tumors of mice receiving n-acmel-anti-ly-2.1 conjugate or rtnf-alpha alone. this and other experiments indicated that the antitumor effect and tumor localization of n-acmel-moab conjugates can be enhanced in vivo by rtnf-alpha, thereby enabling successful eradication of larger established subcutaneous murine tumors.
pharmacological and genetic accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α enhances excitatory synaptic transmission in hippocampal neurons through the production of vascular endothelial growth factor in addition to its potent effects on vasculature, it has become clear that vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) has effects on both neurons and glia, and recent studies suggest that it can be neuroprotective. to determine potential mechanisms underlying this neuroprotection, recombinant human vegf was bath applied to adult rat hippocampal slices, and both extracellular and intracellular recordings were used to examine intrinsic properties and synaptic responses of hippocampal principal neurons. initial studies in area ca1 showed that vegf significantly reduced the amplitude of responses elicited by schaffer collateral stimulation, without influencing membrane properties. similar effects occurred in ca3 pyramidal cells and dentate gyrus granule cells when their major glutamatergic afferents were stimulated. because vegf expression is increased after seizures, effects of vegf were also examined in rats with recurrent spontaneous seizures. vegf reduced spontaneous discharges in slices from these rats but had surprisingly little effect on epileptiform discharges produced by disinhibition of slices from control rats. these results demonstrate a previously unknown effect of vegf on neuronal activity and also demonstrate a remarkable potency in the epileptic brain. based on this, we suggest that vegf or vegf-related targets could provide useful endpoints to direct novel therapeutic strategies for epilepsy.
functional and quantitative mri mapping of somatomotor representations of human supralaryngeal vocal tract the sensory projections from the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx are crucial in assuring safe deglutition, coughing, breathing, and voice production/speaking. although several studies using neuroimaging techniques have demonstrated cortical activation related to pharyngeal and laryngeal functions, little is known regarding sensory projections from the laryngeal area to the somatosensory cortex. the purpose of this study was to establish the cortical activity evoked by somatic air-puff stimulation at the laryngeal mucosa using magnetoencephalography. twelve healthy volunteers were trained to inhibit swallowing in response to air stimuli delivered to the larynx. minimum norm estimates was performed on the laryngeal somatosensory evoked fields (lsefs) to best differentiate the target activations from non-task-related activations. evoked magnetic fields were recorded with acceptable reproducibility in the left hemisphere, with a peak latency of approximately 100ms in 10 subjects. peak activation was estimated at the caudolateral region of the primary somatosensory area (s1). these results establish the ability to detect lsefs with an acceptable reproducibility within a single subject and among subjects. these results also suggest the existence of laryngeal somatic afferent input to the caudolateral region of s1 in human. our findings indicate that further investigation in this area is needed, and should focus on laryngeal lateralization, swallowing, and speech processing.
usefulness of plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin concentration for predicting the severity and mortality of patients with community-acquired pneumonia. purposeto study the impact of inflammation/sepsis on the concentrations of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (ngal) in plasma and urine in adult intensive care unit (icu) patients and to estimate the predictive properties of ngal in plasma and urine for early detection of acute kidney injury (aki) in patients with septic shock.methodssixty-five patients admitted to the general icu at the karolinska university hospital solna, sweden, with normal plasma creatinine were assessed for eligibility. twenty-seven patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (sirs), severe sepsis, or septic shock without aki and 18 patients with septic shock and concomitant aki were included in the final analysis. plasma and urine were analyzed twice daily for plasma ngal (pngal), c-reactive protein (crp), procalcitonin, myeloperoxidase, plasma cystatin c, plasma creatinine, urine ngal (ungal), urine cystatin c, and urine α1-microglobulin.resultsof the 45 patients, 40 had elevated peak levels of pngal. peak levels of pngal were not significantly different between septic shock patients with and without aki. peak levels of ungal were below the upper reference limit in all but four patients without aki. ungal was a good predictor (area under roc 0.86) whereas pngal was a poor predictor (area under roc 0.67) for aki within the next 12 h in patients with septic shock.conclusionspngal is raised in patients with sirs, severe sepsis, and septic shock and should be used with caution as a marker of aki in icu patients with septic shock. ungal is more useful in predicting aki as the levels are not elevated in septic patients without aki.
three-dimensional histological specimen preparation for accurate imaging and spatial reconstruction of the middle and inner ear abstract conclusion: candidates for hearing preservation cochlear implant (ci) surgery can be divided into: those who benefit from electrical complement (ec) to remaining hearing and don't require additional amplification, those using a combined electric-acoustic stimulation (eas) and those with the least amount of residual hearing who benefit from electric-only stimulation (es) provided via medium length electrode. objectives: patients with a borderline level of residual hearing may benefit from a hybrid electric stimulation and acoustic amplification (eas) after a cochlear implantation procedure aimed at hearing preservation. however, there is another group of individuals who possess substantial low-frequency residual hearing that is still functional. these partially deaf patients present a ‘cliff-like’ audiogram and have difficulty in comfortable listening, especially in noisy conditions and are deprived of the full enjoyment of music. methods: eleven adults and seven children were implanted via round window with insertion depth intentionally limited to 18–22 mm. none of them could benefit from hearing aids before surgery and they were considered for ec to their residual hearing. results: pure tone audiograms and discrimination scores show benefit from either ec to conserved natural acoustic hearing or eas. one patient with a loss of functional residual hearing benefited from electrical stimulation (es) and a standard ci coding strategy.
pseudorabies virus infection alters neuronal activity and connectivity in vitro we provide physiological, pharmacological, and structural evidence that axons of hippocampal principal cells are electrically coupled, with prepotentials or spikelets forming the physiological substrate of electrical coupling as observed in cell somata. antidromic activation of neighboring axons induced somatic spikelet potentials in neurons of ca3, ca1, and dentate gyrus areas of rat hippocampal slices. somatic invasion by these spikelets was dependent on the activation of fast na(+) channels in the postjunctional neuron. antidromically elicited spikelets were suppressed by gap junction blockers and low intracellular ph. paired axo-somatic and somato-dendritic recordings revealed that the coupling potentials appeared in the axon before invading the soma and the dendrite. using confocal laser scanning microscopy we found that putative axons of principal cells were dye coupled. our data thus suggest that hippocampal neurons are coupled by axo-axonal junctions, providing a novel mechanism for very fast electrical communication.
chromosomal microarray analysis of consecutive individuals with autism spectrum disorders using an ultra-high resolution chromosomal microarray optimized for neurodevelopmental disorders copy number variants (cnvs) as detected by chromosomal microarray analysis (cma) significantly contribute to the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as developmental delay (dd), intellectual disability (id), and autism spectrum disorder (asd). this study summarizes the results of 3.5 years of cma testing by a clia-certified clinical testing laboratory 5487 patients with neurodevelopmental conditions were clinically evaluated for rare copy number variants using a 2.8-million probe custom cma optimized for the detection of cnvs associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. we report an overall detection rate of 29.4% in our neurodevelopmental cohort, which rises to nearly 33% when cases with dd/id and/or mca only are considered. the detection rate for the asd cohort is also significant, at 25%. additionally, we find that detection rate and pathogenic yield of cma vary significantly depending on the primary indications for testing, the age of the individuals tested, and the specialty of the ordering doctor. we also report a significant difference between the detection rate on the ultrahigh resolution optimized array in comparison to the array from which it originated. this increase in detection can significantly contribute to the efficient and effective medical management of neurodevelopmental conditions in the clinic.
schomburg distance-dependent knowledge-based potential prediction of protein thermostability with a direction-and p < we have developed a method to both predict the geometry and the relative stability of point mutants that may be used for arbitrary mutations. the geometry optimization procedure was first tested on a new benchmark of 2141 ordered pairs of x‐ray crystal structures of proteins that differ by a single point mutation, the largest data set to date. an empirical energy function, which includes terms representing the energy contributions of the folded and denatured proteins and uses the predicted mutant side chain conformation, was fit to a training set consisting of half of a diverse set of 1816 experimental stability values for single point mutations in 81 different proteins. the data included a substantial number of small to large residue mutations not considered by previous prediction studies. after removing 22 (≈2%) outliers, the stability calculation gave a standard deviation of 1.08 kcal/mol with a correlation coefficient of 0.82. the prediction method was then tested on the remaining half of the experimental data, giving a standard deviation of 1.10 kcal/mol and covariance of 0.66 for 97% of the test set. a regression fit of the energy function to a subset of 137 mutants, for which both native and mutant structures were available, gave a prediction error comparable to that for the complete training set with predicted side chain conformations. we found that about half of the variation is due to conformation‐independent residue contributions. finally, a fit to the experimental stability data using these residue parameters exclusively suggests guidelines for improving protein stability in the absence of detailed structure information. proteins 2004. © 2004 wiley‐liss, inc.
nitric oxide activates an nrf2/sulfiredoxin antioxidant pathway in macrophages. neutrophils and other phagocytes manufacture o(2)(-) (superoxide) by the one-electron reduction of oxygen at the expense of nadph. most of the o(2)(-) reacts with itself to form h(2)o(2) (hydrogen peroxide). from these agents a large number of highly reactive microbicidal oxidants are formed, including hocl (hypochlorous acid), which is produced by the myeloperoxidase-catalyzed oxidation of cl(-) by h(2)o(2); oh(*) (hydroxyl radical), produced by the reduction of h(2)o(2) by fe(++) or cu(+); onoo(-) (peroxynitrite), formed by the reaction between o(2)(-) and no(*); and many others. these reactive oxidants are manufactured for the purpose of killing invading microorganisms, but they also inflict damage on nearby tissues, and are thought to be of pathogenic significance in a large number of diseases. included among these are emphysema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, atherosclerosis, reperfusion injury, malignancy and rheumatoid arthritis.
enhanced expression of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases in aniline-induced cell proliferation in rat spleen. cell cycle progression and cell division are driven by the sequential activation of a group of serine-threonine kinases called cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks). multiple cdks control the cell cycle in mammals and have been long considered essential for normal proliferation, development and homeostasis. the importance of the cdk-cyclin complexes in cell proliferation is underscored by the fact that deregulation of the cdk activity is found in virtually the whole spectrum of human tumors. advances in the cell cycle proteins in the last 25 years, since the discovery of cyclins, have been discussed and have shed even more light on this essential life sustaining process. recent information from different models for the various cyclins and cdks have made some of the generally accepted concepts of cell cycle regulation to be revised and new and exciting questions to be investigated. there is also increasing evidence that suggests that cdks such as cdc2 are also commonly targeted by viral proteins, which modulate host cell cycle machinery to benefit viral survival or replication. this review, describes some of the most recent and important us patents related to cell cycle regulation and those on viral proteins involved in cell cycle modulation particularly the g2/m phase transition and cancer therapy.
reverse projection retrieval in edge illumination x-ray phase contrast computed tomography x-ray phase contrast imaging is probably the most relevant among emerging x-ray imaging techniques, and it has the proven potential of revolutionizing the field of diagnostic radiology. impressive images of a wide range of samples have been obtained, mostly at synchrotron radiation facilities. the necessity of relying on synchrotron radiation has prevented to a large extent a widespread diffusion of phase contrast imaging, thus precluding its transfer to clinical practice. a new technique, based on the use of coded apertures, was recently developed at ucl. this technique was demonstrated to provide intense phase contrast signals with conventional x-ray sources and detectors. unlike other attempts at making phase contrast imaging feasible with conventional sources, the coded-aperture approach does not impose substantial limitations and/or filtering of the radiation beam, and it therefore allows, for the first time, exposures compatible with clinical practice. the technique has been thoroughly modelled, and this paper describes the technique in detail by going through the different steps of the modelling. all the main factors influencing image quality are discussed, alongside the viability of realizing a prototype suitable for clinical use. the model has been experimentally validated and a section of the paper shows the comparison between simulated and experimental results.
pitx3 dna methylation is an independent predictor of overall survival in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma gene amplification, a common mechanism for oncogene activation in cancer, has been used as a tag for the identification of novel oncogenes. dna amplification is frequently observed in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc) and potential oncogenes have already been reported. we applied restriction landmark genome scanning (rlgs) to study gene amplifications and low-level copy number changes in hnscc in order to locate previously uncharacterized regions with copy number gains in primary tumor samples. a total of 63 enhanced rlgs fragments, indicative of dna copy number changes, including gains of single alleles, were scored. enhanced sequences were identified from 33 different chromosomal regions including those previously reported (e.g. 3q26.3 and 11q13.3) as well as novel regions (e.g. 3q29, 8q13.1, 8q22.3, 9q32, 10q24.32, 14q32.32, 17q25.1 and 20q13.33). furthermore, our data suggest that amplicons 11q13.3 and 3q26.3–q29 may be divided into possibly two and three independent amplicons, respectively, an observation supported by published microarray expression data.
herbicide injury induces dna methylome alterations in arabidopsis glyphosate is a systemic, nonselective and most widely used herbicide in the world. the introduction of glyphosate-resistant crops in the mid-1990s resulted in a dramatic increase in the use of glyphosate herbicide making it most widely used herbicide in the world. the average maize yield loss in the field caused by pests is around 20 % but in many regions it is much higher. it is now clear that glyphosate causes broader range of physiological alterations than previously assumed and some plants gain higher level of resistance to glyphosate without the need to use genetic engineering methods. to understand the mechanisms of such heightened resistance we must first know the processes mediating the plants’ death in response to glyphosate treatment. here, we show that 12 mirnas, belonging to mir167, mir396, mir159, mir156, mir169, mir444 and mir827 families, are significantly upregulated, and one, mir166, downregulated following glyphosate treatment. these mirnas have been previously shown to be involved in abiotic stress responses and implicated in senescence. strikingly, two of the induced mirnas, mir444 and mir827, have been shown to regulate phosphate transport pathways, which seem to be common for pi and glyphosate uptake.
overexpression of npr1 in brassica juncea confers broad spectrum resistance to fungal pathogens the key regulator of salicylic acid (sa)-mediated resistance, npr1, is functionally conserved in diverse plant species, including rice (oryza sativa l.). investigation in depth is needed to provide an understanding of npr1-mediated resistance and a practical strategy for the improvement of disease resistance in the model crop rice. the rice genome contains five npr1-like genes. in our study, three rice homologous genes, osnpr1/nh1, osnpr2/nh2 and osnpr3, were found to be induced by rice bacterial blight xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and rice blast magnaporthe grisea, and the defence molecules benzothiadiazole, methyl jasmonate and ethylene. we confirmed that osnpr1 is the rice orthologue by complementing the arabidopsis npr1 mutant. over-expression of osnpr1 conferred disease resistance to bacterial blight, but also enhanced herbivore susceptibility in transgenic plants. the osnpr1-green fluorescent protein (gfp) fusion protein was localized in the cytoplasm and moved into the nucleus after redox change. mutations in its conserved cysteine residues led to the constitutive localization of osnpr1(2ca)-gfp in the nucleus and also abolished herbivore hypersensitivity in transgenic rice. different subcellular localizations of osnpr1 antagonistically regulated sa- and jasmonic acid (ja)-responsive genes, but not sa and ja levels, indicating that osnpr1 might mediate antagonistic cross-talk between the sa- and ja-dependent pathways in rice. this study demonstrates that rice has evolved an sa-mediated systemic acquired resistance similar to that in arabidopsis, and also provides a practical approach for the improvement of disease resistance without the penalty of decreased herbivore resistance in rice.
characterization of four defense-related genes up-regulated in root nodules of casuarina glauca plant peroxidases (class iii peroxidases) are present in all land plants. they are members of a large multigenic family. probably due to this high number of isoforms, and to a very heterogeneous regulation of their expression, plant peroxidases are involved in a broad range of physiological processes all along the plant life cycle. due to two possible catalytic cycles, peroxidative and hydroxylic, peroxidases can generate reactive oxygen species (ros) (•oh, hoo•), polymerise cell wall compounds, and regulate h2o2 levels. by modulating their activity and expression following internal and external stimuli, peroxidases are prevalent at every stage of plant growth, including the demands that the plant meets in stressful conditions. these multifunctional enzymes can build a rigid wall or produce ros to make it more flexible; they can prevent biological and chemical attacks by raising physical barriers or by counterattacking with a large production of ros; they can be involved in a more peaceful symbiosis. they are finally present from the first hours of a plant’s life until its last moments. although some functions look paradoxical, the whole process is probably regulated by a fine-tuning that has yet to be elucidated. this review will discuss the factors that can influence this delicate balance.
photochemical transformation of benzotriazole, relevant to sunlit surface waters: assessing the possible role of triplet-sensitised processes. the occurrence and removal of 58 pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors, corrosion inhibitors, biocides, and pesticides, were assessed in the wastewater treatment plant (wwtp) of the city of lausanne, switzerland, as well as in the effluent-receiving water body, the vidy bay of lake geneva. an analytical screening method to simultaneously measure all of the 58 micropollutants was developed based on ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to a tandem mass spectrometer (uplc-ms/ms). the selection of pharmaceuticals was primarily based on a prioritization study, which designated them as environmentally relevant for the lake geneva region. except for the endocrine disruptor 17alpha-ethinylestradiol, all substances were detected in 24-h composite samples of wastewater entering the wwtp or in the treated effluent. of these compounds, 40% were also detected in raw drinking water, pumped from the lake 3 km downstream of the wwtp. the contributions of dilution and degradation to micropollutant elimination between the wwtp outlet and the raw drinking water intake were established in different model scenarios using hypothetical residence times of the wastewater in vidy bay of 1, 4, or 90 d. concentration decrease due to processes other than dilution was observed for diclofenac, beta-blockers, several antibiotics, corrosion inhibitors, and pesticides. measured environmental concentrations (mecs) of pharmaceuticals were compared to the predicted environmental concentrations (pecs) determined in the prioritization study and agreed within one order of magnitude, but mecs were typically greater than the corresponding pecs. predicted no-effect concentrations of the analgesic paracetamol, and the two antibiotics ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole, were exceeded in raw drinking water samples and therefore present a potential risk to the ecosystem.
effect of planar cuts' orientation on the perceived surface layout and object's shape. most existing computational models of the visual perception of three-dimensional shape from texture are based on assumed constraints about how texture is distributed on visible surfaces. the research described in the present article was designed to investigate how violations of these assumptions influence human perception. observers were presented with images of smoothly curved surfaces depicted with different types of texture, whose distribution of surface markings could be both anisotropic and inhomogeneous. observers judged the pattern of ordinal depth on each object by marking local maxima and minima along designated scan lines. they also judged the apparent magnitudes of relative depth between designated probe points on the surface. the results revealed a high degree of accuracy and reliability in all conditions, except for a systematic underestimation of the overall magnitude of surface relief. these findings suggest that human perception of three-dimensional shape from texture is much more robust than would be reasonable to expect based on current computational models of this phenomenon.
enhancing the effects of extinction on attention-maintained behavior through noncontingent delivery of attention or stimuli identified via a competing stimulus assessment. we present one method for distinguishing between extinction and punishment effects. the proportion of responses that produced a consequence (blocking) was varied while hand mouthing was treated in a man diagnosed with profound mental retardation. response patterns across the schedule changes suggested that the blocking procedure functioned as a punishing event.

kaposiform hemangioendothelioma of the spleen in an adult: an initial case report we report the clinical and pathological features of nine distinctive, but relatively unknown, vascular tumors of infancy and childhood presenting as soft tissue masses often associated with locally aggressive disease, lymphangiomatosis and kasabach-merritt syndrome. the patients, four males and five females, were all in their first decade of life except for two (median, 2 years; range, 5 months to 19 years). these tumors involved deep soft tissues of the upper extremity (four cases), retroperitoneum (two cases), chest wall, scalp, and neck (one case each). four patients also had kasabach-merritt syndrome, and three patients had lymphangiomatosis. lymphangiomatosis consisted of diffusely infiltrating lymphangioma of soft tissue (three cases) and in two by the additional presence of bone lesions. in one of these three cases, lymphangiomatosis antedated the diagnosis of the vascular tumor, and in the remainder they were concurrently diagnosed. tumors were characterized by infiltrating, interconnecting sheets or irregular nodules of slender endothelial cells lining crescentic or slit-like vessels and, less commonly, rounded capillary-type vessels. within some tumors, nests of epithelioid endothelial cells with prominent eosinophilic cytoplasm containing finely granular hemosiderin, hyaline droplets, and cytoplasmic vacuoles were identified. smaller amounts of hemosiderin were observed within the spindled endothelial cells and microthrombi could be seen occasionally within the tiny lumina. nuclear atypia was minimal within these tumors and mitotic figures were infrequent, averaging 2 to 3/10 high-power fields (hpf) (range 0-7/10 hpf). larger, well-formed feeding vessels were present at the periphery of the tumor. the endothelium of these vessels expressed factor viii-ag, cd34, and bound ulex europaeus, and muscle- specific actin. in contrast, the spindled tumor cells expressed only cd34. human papilloma virus (hpv)-16- like dna transcripts, which have been identified in cases of kaposi's sarcoma, were not detected by polymerase chain reaction in two cases. follow-up information revealed that four patients were alive without disease after wide excision, multiple excision(s), or amputation (one case); three were alive with disease; and two died, one from lymphangiomatosis with respiratory compromise and the other from hemorrhage complicating kasabach-merritt syndrome. it appears that treatment should consist of wide local excision and supportive therapy for associated symptoms.
integrative genomic analysis in k562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells reveals that proximal ncor1 binding positively regulates genes that govern erythroid differentiation and imatinib sensitivity lysine-specific demethylase 1 (lsd1, kdm1a) functions as a transcriptional corepressor through demethylation of histone 3 lysine 4 (h3k4) but has a coactivator function on some genes through mechanisms that are unclear. we show that lsd1, interacting with corest, associates with and coactivates androgen receptor (ar) on a large fraction of androgen-stimulated genes. a subset of these ar/lsd1-associated enhancer sites have histone 3 threonine 6 phosphorylation (h3t6ph), and these sites are further enriched for androgen-stimulated genes. significantly, despite its coactivator activity, lsd1 still mediates h3k4me2 demethylation at these androgen-stimulated enhancers. foxa1 is also associated with lsd1 at ar-regulated enhancer sites, and a foxa1 interaction with lsd1 enhances binding of both proteins at these sites. these findings show that lsd1 functions broadly as a regulator of ar function, that it maintains a transcriptional repression function at ar-regulated enhancers through h3k4 demethylation, and that it has a distinct ar-linked coactivator function mediated by demethylation of other substrates.
pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic modelling of antipsychotic drugs in patients with schizophrenia: part ii: the use of subscales of the panss score background to develop a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (pk-pd) model using individual-level data of positive and negative syndrome scale (panss) total score to characterize the antipsychotic drug effect taking into account the placebo effect and dropout rate. in addition, a clinical utility (cu) criterion that describes the usefulness of a drug therapy was calculated using the efficacy of the drug and dropout rates.   methods data from 12 clinical trials in schizophrenia patients was used to quantify the effects of the antipsychotic drugs (aps), namely, haloperidol, risperidone, olanzapine, ziprasidone and paliperidone. compartmental pk models were used to describe the time course of plasma drug concentrations. the combination of an emax and the weibull model was used to describe the drug and placebo effects. the steady-state drug concentrations were assumed to be the drivers of the exposure-response relationship. an exponential model was utilized to identify the predictors of probability of dropout. simulations were performed to check the predictability of the model, and to calculate the cu of the drugs based on panss scores and dropout rates.   results the maximal drug effect (e(max)) was highest for olanzapine whilst it was lowest for ziprasidone. higher observed panss scores resulted in a greater likelihood of dropout. taking into account the efficacy and the drop-out rate, all aps possessed a comparable cu at the therapeutic doses. the resulting pk-pd model parameters were used to compute the effective concentration and dose required to produce a clinically meaningful 30% drop in panss score from the baseline.   conclusions the developed pk-pd model and the associated cu score allow the evaluation of the time course of the panss scores of the different aps and a proper comparison of their clinically relevant treatments effects.
aryl hydrocarbon receptor is required for optimal b‐cell proliferation recent advances in genomics and proteomics, combined with the facilitated generation and analysis of transgenic and gene-knockout animals, have revealed new complexities in classical biological systems, including the b-cell compartment. studies on an 'old', but poorly characterized, b-cell subset — the naive, marginal-zone (mz) b-cell subset — over the past two years have spawned an avalanche of data that encompass the generation and function of these cells. now that the initial 'infatuation' is over, it is time to reconsider these data and generate some conclusions that can be incorporated into a working model of the b-cell system.
influence of 24-hour sleep deprivation on respiration in lambs variations in heart rate and respiration rate were found to be responsive to total sleep deprivation, particularly under experimental conditions more realistic to everyday life.
maternal protein restriction before pregnancy reduces offspring early body mass and affects glucose metabolism in c57bl/6jbom mice. epidemiological studies have indicated that susceptibility of human adults to hypertension and cardiovascular disease may result from intrauterine growth restriction and low birth weight induced by maternal undernutrition. although the 'foetal origins of adult disease' hypothesis has significant relevance to preventative healthcare, the origin and biological mechanisms of foetal programming are largely unknown. here, we investigate the origin, embryonic phenotype and potential maternal mechanisms of programming within an established rat model. maternal low protein diet (lpd) fed during only the preimplantation period of development (0-4.25 days after mating), before return to control diet for the remainder of gestation, induced programming of altered birthweight, postnatal growth rate, hypertension and organ/body-weight ratios in either male or female offspring at up to 12 weeks of age. preimplantation embryos collected from dams after 0-4.25 days of maternal lpd displayed significantly reduced cell numbers, first within the inner cell mass (icm; early blastocyst), and later within both icm and trophectoderm lineages (mid/late blastocyst), apparently induced by a slower rate of cellular proliferation rather than by increased apoptosis. the lpd regimen significantly reduced insulin and essential amino acid levels, and increased glucose levels within maternal serum by day 4 of development. our data indicate that long-term programming of postnatal growth and physiology can be induced irreversibly during the preimplantation period of development by maternal protein undernutrition. further, we propose that the mildly hyperglycaemic and amino acid-depleted maternal environment generated by undernutrition may act as an early mechanism of programming and initiate conditions of 'metabolic stress', restricting early embryonic proliferation and the generation of appropriately sized stem-cell lineages.
response properties underlying selectivity for the rate of frequency modulated sweeps in the auditory cortex of the mouse the auditory nerve isoelectric thresholds, in response to tone pigs ranging from 5 to 20 khz, are similar in the young c57bl/6 and cba/j mice, although the latter genotype has somewhat more sensitive responses from 30 to 80 khz. but their behavioral audiograms, obtained by the classical conditioning technique of ehret, are very discrepant. even though the behavioral audiogram of the cba/j mouse can be predicted by measurements from its auditory nerve, the behavioral thresholds of the young c57bl/6 mouse are approximately 40 db less sensitive than its electrophysiological measurements. cochlear hair cell loss was not evident in young mice of either genotype. as the cba/j approaches the end of its predicted life span, its auditory anatomy, physiology and behavior are not significantly altered; but those rare individuals, who exceed their predicted life span by 40% finally develop hearing loss of a mixed nature. by contrast, the c57bl/6 mouse shows a relatively rapid decline of hearing as it ages. by 200 days of age, its auditory nerve responses are 30 db less sensitive at 5 khz, and 55 db less sensitive at 30 khz, than similar measures taken at adolescence. over this same age span, its behavioral sensitivity has only declined by 15 and 25 db at these two frequencies. hair cell counts correlated poorly with both behavioral and electrophysiological auditory measures in the c57bl/6 mouse.
cancer and fertility preservation: barcelona consensus meeting several lines of evidence demonstrate that the biology, genetics and environment of childhood solid tumours (csts) sets them apart from adult solid tumours. the nature of the progenitor cells from which these tumours arise, and their immature tissue environment, allows csts to develop with fewer defects in cell regulatory processes than adult cancers. these differences could explain why csts are more susceptible to therapeutic intervention than adult tumours. how does the aetiology of these cancers differ from those occurring in adults and how might this affect the development of more effective therapies?
trends in the use of natural antioxidants in active food packaging: a review this research was aimed at evaluating the inhibition of oxidative changes of beef patties packaged in modified atmosphere (70% o(2)+20% co(2)+10% n(2)) by natural antioxidants: ascorbic acid (500 ppm), taurine (50 mm), carnosine (50 mm), rosemary powder (1000 ppm) and their combinations with the first. beef patties stored at 2±1°c for 20 days were evaluated for colour (l*, a*, b*, c* and h*), tbars, metmyoglobin formation (% of total myoglobin), psychrotrophic microbial counts and sensory odour and discolouration. rosemary, either alone or with ascorbic acid, was highly effective in inhibiting both metmyoglobin formation and lipid oxidation; sensory analysis was in agreement with these results. ascorbic acid, ascorbic acid+taurine and ascorbic acid+carnosine treatments showed a limited inhibitory effect of myoglobin oxidation, while carnosine and carnosine+ascorbic acid were effective in inhibiting lipid oxidation. taurine alone failed to exert any antioxidant effect. principal components analysis confirmed these results.
a stage for social comparison - the value of information in virtual communities hypotheses involving mediation are common in the behavioral sciences. mediation exists when a predictor affects a dependent variable indirectly through at least one intervening variable, or mediator. methods to assess mediation involving multiple simultaneous mediators have received little attention in the methodological literature despite a clear need. we provide an overview of simple and multiple mediation and explore three approaches that can be used to investigate indirect processes, as well as methods for contrasting two or more mediators within a single model. we present an illustrative example, assessing and contrasting potential mediators of the relationship between the helpfulness of socialization agents and job satisfaction. we also provide sas and spss macros, as well as mplus and lisrel syntax, to facilitate the use of these methods in applications.
histone deacetylases 1 and 2 are required for brain development. histone deacetylases (hdacs) modulate chromatin structure and transcription, but little is known about their function in mammalian development. hdac1 was implicated previously in the repression of genes required for cell proliferation and differentiation. here we show that targeted disruption of both hdac1 alleles results in embryonic lethality before e10.5 due to severe proliferation defects and retardation in development. hdac1‐deficient embryonic stem cells show reduced proliferation rates, which correlate with decreased cyclin‐associated kinase activities and elevated levels of the cyclin‐dependent kinase inhibitors p21waf1/cip1 and p27kip1. similarly, expression of p21 and p27 is up‐regulated in hdac1‐null embryos. in addition, loss of hdac1 leads to significantly reduced overall deacetylase activity, hyperacetylation of a subset of histones h3 and h4 and concomitant changes in other histone modifications. the expression of hdac2 and hdac3 is induced in hdac1‐deficient cells, but cannot compensate for loss of the enzyme, suggesting a unique function for hdac1. our study provides the first evidence that a histone deacetylase is essential for unrestricted cell proliferation by repressing the expression of selective cell cycle inhibitors.
spiroindolines identify the vesicular acetylcholine transporter as a novel target for insecticide action the past 30 years have witnessed a period of significant expansion in the use of halogenated compounds in the field of agrochemical research and development. the introduction of halogens into active ingredients has become an important concept in the quest for a modern agrochemical with optimal efficacy, environmental safety, user friendliness and economic viability. outstanding progress has been made, especially in synthetic methods for particular halogen-substituted key intermediates that were previously prohibitively expensive. interestingly, there has been a rise in the number of commercial products containing 'mixed' halogens, e.g. one or more fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine atoms in addition to one or more further halogen atoms. extrapolation of the current trend indicates that a definite growth is to be expected in fluorine-substituted agrochemicals throughout the twenty-first century. a number of these recently developed agrochemical candidates containing halogen substituents represent novel classes of chemical compounds with new modes of action. however, the complex structure-activity relationships associated with biologically active molecules mean that the introduction of halogens can lead to either an increase or a decrease in the efficacy of a compound, depending on its changed mode of action, physicochemical properties, target interaction or metabolic susceptibility and transformation. in spite of modern design concepts, it is still difficult to predict the sites in a molecule at which halogen substitution will result in optimal desired effects. this review describes comprehensively the successful utilisation of halogens and their unique role in the design of modern agrochemicals, exemplified by various commercial products from bayer cropscience coming from different agrochemical areas.
a ubiquitin-binding protein, faap20, links rnf8-mediated ubiquitination to the fanconi anemia dna repair network. cells from fanconi anemia (fa) patients are extremely sensitive to dna interstrand crosslinking (icl) agents, but the molecular basis of the hypersensitivity remains to be explored. fancm (fa complementation group m), and its binding partner, faap24, anchor the multisubunit fa core complex to chromatin after dna damage and may contribute to icl-specific cellular response. here we show that the fancm/faap24 complex is specifically required for the recruitment of replication protein a (rpa) to icl-stalled replication forks. icl-induced rpa foci formation requires the dna-binding activity of faap24 but not the dna translocase activity of fancm. furthermore, fancm/faap24-dependent rpa foci formation is required for efficient atr-mediated checkpoint activation in response to icl. therefore, we propose that fancm/faap24 plays a role in icl-induced checkpoint activation through regulating rpa recruiment at icl-stalled replication forks.
rickettsial outer‐membrane protein b (rompb) mediates bacterial invasion through ku70 in an actin, c‐cbl, clathrin and caveolin 2‐dependent manner increasing evidence indicates that pathogens have evolved highly efficient strategies to induce their internalization within host cells. viruses and bacteria express and expose on their surface, molecules that mimic endogenous ligands to cell receptors, thereby inducing specific intracellular signalling cascades. more recently it has become clear that, as most viruses, bacteria can enter cells via the clathrin‐mediated pathway, indicating a key role for endocytosis in pathogens entry into cells. here we review the pathways followed by listeria monocytogenes to enter into non‐phagocytic cells, as a model for the subversion of cellular functions to induce pathogens internalization.
for whom and under what circumstances do school-based energy balance behavior interventions work? systematic review on moderators specific interventions included in the review studies that assessed policy or environmental interventions to promote physical activity and/or good nutrition were eligible for inclusion. studies had to describe the intervention to be included. the environment was defined as 'anything and everything outside the person', while environmental strategies were defined as those that involved changing the physical, social-cultural, economic or organisational systems to promote behaviour change. studies that assessed educational strategies at the individual level but focused mainly on environmental strategies were eligible for inclusion. to be included in the review, studies had to report tests of interaction or moderation between the intervention studied and a second independent variable. studies on the effects of media campaigns, determinants research, or individual-level interventions were excluded.
dynamic x-ray diffraction imaging of the ferroelectric response in bismuth ferrite using in situ high-resolution synchrotron x-ray scattering, the curie temperature tc has been determined for ultrathin c-axis epitaxial pbtio3 films on conducting substrates (srruo3 on srtio3), with surfaces exposed to a controlled vapor environment. the suppression of tc was relatively small, even for the thinnest film (1.2 nm). we observe that 180 degrees stripe domains do not form, indicating that the depolarizing field is compensated by free charge at both interfaces. this is confirmed by ab initio calculations that find polar ground states in the presence of ionic adsorbates.
astrocytic probdnf and tonic gaba distinguish active versus reactive astrocytes in hippocampus activity-dependent secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) is thought to enhance synaptic plasticity, but the mechanisms controlling extracellular availability and clearance of secreted bdnf are poorly understood. we show that bdnf is secreted in its precursor form (pro-bdnf) and is then cleared from the extracellular space through rapid uptake by nearby astrocytes after θ-burst stimulation in layer ii/iii of cortical slices, a paradigm resulting in long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission. internalization of pro-bdnf occurs via the formation of a complex with the pan-neurotrophin receptor p75 and subsequent clathrin-dependent endocytosis. fluorescence-tagged pro-bdnf and real-time total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy in cultured astrocytes is used to monitor single endocytic vesicles in response to the neurotransmitter glutamate. we find that endocytosed pro-bdnf is routed into a fast recycling pathway for subsequent soluble nsf attachment protein receptor–dependent secretion. thus, astrocytes contain an endocytic compartment competent for pro-bdnf recycling, suggesting a specialized form of bidirectional communication between neurons and glia.
randomized trial of different intraabdominal pressures and acid–base balance alterations during laparoscopic cholecystectomy controversy has been raised about the effects of systemic carbon dioxide accumulation versus the intra-abdominal pressure on hemodynamics during laparoscopy. we compared the acid-base and hemodynamic changes during pneumoperitoneum in a randomized cross-over study between co2 and nitrogen gases to test the hypothesis that the co2 absorbed during laparoscopy, rather than the 15 mmhg intra-abdominal pressure created, accounted for these changes. eight adult pigs were anesthetized and ventilated with a fixed minute ventilation. metabolic function was measured from analysis of expired flow by a metabolic measurement cart. after baseline periods, animals were randomized into two groups, for 2 hr of either co2 or nitrogen pneumoperitoneum at 15 mmhg intra-abdominal pressure, followed by 1 hr of recovery. after at least a 48-hr recovery period, the experiment was repeated with the other gas. metabolic data revealed that there was a significant absorption of co2 gas across the peritoneal epithelium during co2 pneumoperitoneum. animals insufflated with co2 gas experienced a 75% increase in pulmonary co2 excretion, with significant acidemia and hypercapnia, whereas there were no acid-base disturbances in those with nitrogen insufflation. oxygen consumption remained essentially unchanged in both groups, even during pneumoperitoneum. co2 pneumoperitoneum was also associated with systemic and pulmonary arterial hypertension and a reduction in stroke volume of up to 15%. pneumoperitoneum alone did not compromise hemodynamics. pneumoperitoneum using co2 gas during laparoscopy resulted in systemic co2 absorption across the peritoneum. this led to acidemia, hypercapnea, and depressed hemodynamics. the intra-abdominal pressure routinely used during laparoscopic surgery did not affect metabolic function, acid-base balance, or hemodynamics in the experimental model.
antioxidant activities, phenols and flavonoid contents of curcuma longa l. and curcuma caesia roxb. found in manipur plant phenolic compounds such as flavonoids and lignin precursors are important constituents of the human diet. these dietary phytophenolics have been recognized largely as beneficial antioxidants that can scavenge harmful active oxygen species including o(2)(.-), h(2)o(2), .oh, and (1)o(2). here we review our current understanding of the antioxidant and prooxidant actions of phenolics in plant cells. in plant systems, phytophenolics can act as antioxidants by donating electrons to guaiacol-type peroxidases (gupxs) for the detoxification of h(2)o(2) produced under stress conditions. as a result of such enzymatic as well as non-enzymatic antioxidant reactions, phenoxyl radicals are formed as the primary oxidized products. until recently, phenoxyl radicals had been difficult to detect by static electron spin resonance (esr) because they rapidly change to non-radical products. application of zn exerts spin-stabilizing effects on phenoxyl radicals that enables us to analyze the formation and decay kinetics of the radicals. the esr signals of phenoxyl radicals are eliminated by monodehydroascorbate radical (mda) reductase, suggesting that phenoxyl radicals, like the ascorbate radical, are enzymatically recycled to parent phenolics. thus, phenolics in plant cells can form an antioxidant system equivalent to that of ascorbate. in contrast to their antioxidant activity, phytophenolics also have the potential to act as prooxidants under certain conditions. for example, flavonoids and dihydroxycinnamic acids can nick dna via the production of radicals in the presence of cu and o(2). phenoxyl radicals can also initiate lipid peroxidation. recently, al, zn, ca, mg and cd have been found to stimulate phenoxyl radical-induced lipid peroxidation. we discuss the mechanism of phenoxyl radical prooxidant activity in terms of lifetime prolongation by spin-stabilizing agents.
protein phosphatase 2a forms a molecular complex with shc and regulates shc tyrosine phosphorylation and downstream mitogenic signaling we have reported that inhibition of protein phosphatase 2a (pp2a) by expression of sv40 small t stimulates the mitogenic map kinase cascade. here, we show that sv40 small t can substitute for tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) or serum and stimulate atypical protein kinase c zeta (pkc zeta) activity, resulting in mek activation, cell proliferation and nf-kappab-dependent gene transcriptional activation in cv-1 and nih 3t3 cells. these effects were abrogated by co-expression of kinase-deficient pkc zeta and inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85alpha-p110 by wortmannin, ly294002 and a dominant-negative mutant of p85alpha. in contrast, expression of kinase-inactive erk2 inhibited small t-dependent cell growth but was unable to abolish small t-induced nf-kappab transactivation. our results provide the first in vivo evidence for a critical regulatory role of pp2a in bifunctional pkc zeta signaling pathways controlled by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. constitutive activation of pkc zeta and nf-kappab following inhibition of pp2a supports new mechanisms by which sv40 small t promotes cell growth and transformation. by establishing pp2a as a key player in the response of cells to growth factors and stress signals like tnf-alpha, our findings could explain why pp2a is a primary target utilized during sv40 infection to alter cellular behavior.
using ancestry matching to combine family-based and unrelated samples for genome-wide association studies. association studies using diseased cases and their parents avoid biases due to population stratification, and the transmission/disequilibrium test (tdt) is a popular method of analysis. sample size and power calculations for the tdt method have been reported, but often for the special situation of multiplicative effects of alleles on the genotype relative risks. furthermore, some of the proposed calculations ignore the dependence of transmitted alleles from a pair of heterozygous parents when the effects are not multiplicative, which can lead to erroneous sample size calculations. we demonstrate how to calculate sample size and power for the tdt method for general genotype relative risks. as an alternative to the tdt method, we present likelihood methods for a variety of genotype relative risk models. exact likelihood methods are presented to allow for accurate small‐sample analyses. we demonstrate by numerical comparisons: (1) that the tdt method is inefficient for recessive patterns of relative risks, (2) for alleles that are not rare, falsely assuming a multiplicative model can lead to gross underestimation of the required sample size for the tdt statistic, and (3) for common alleles, if the true genotype relative risks have an approximately dominant pattern, then the tdt method can be grossly inefficient compared to likelihood methods. an alternative likelihood ratio statistic, based on two degrees of freedom, tends to be robust for a wide range of genotype relative risk models. finally, we discuss how to use standard software for conditional logistic regression to accurately assess effects of alleles as well as genotype‐environment interaction. genet. epidemiol. 16:250–260, 1999. © 1999 wiley‐liss, inc.
trafficking-deficient g572r-herg and e637k-herg activate stress and clearance pathways in endoplasmic reticulum a variety of quality control mechanisms operate in the endoplasmic reticulum and in downstream compartments of the secretory pathway to ensure the fidelity and regulation of protein expression during cell life and differentiation. as a rule, only proteins that pass a stringent selection process are transported to their target organelles and compartments. if proper maturation fails, the aberrant products are degraded. quality control improves folding efficiency by retaining proteins in the special folding environment of the endoplasmic reticulum, and it prevents harmful effects that could be caused by the deployment of incompletely folded or assembled proteins.
identification of a novel myosin-va mutation in an ataxic mutant rat, dilute-opisthotonus the mouse dilute (d) locus encodes unconventional myosin-va (myova). mice carrying null alleles of dilute have a lightened coat color and die from a neurological disorder resembling ataxia and opisthotonus within three weeks of birth. immunological and ultrastructural studies suggest that myova is involved in the transport of melanosomes in melanocytes and smooth endoplasmic reticulum in cerebellar purkinje cells. in studies described here, we have used an rt-pcr-based sequencing approach to identify the mutations responsible for 17 viable dilute alleles that vary in their effects on coat color and the nervous system. seven of these mutations mapped to the myova motor domain and are reported here. crystallographic modeling and mutant expression studies were used to predict how these mutations might affect motor domain function and to attempt to correlate these effects with the mutant phenotype.
indirect effects of wnt3a/β-catenin signalling support mouse spermatogonial stem cells in vitro the maintenance of spermatogonial stem cells (sscs) provides the foundation for life-long spermatogenesis. although glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor and fibroblast growth factor 2 are crucial for self-renewal of sscs, recent studies have suggested that other growth factors have important roles in controlling ssc fate. because β-catenin-dependent wnt signaling promotes self-renewal of various stem cell types, we hypothesized that this pathway contributes to ssc maintenance. using transgenic reporter mice for β-catenin-dependent signaling, we found that this signaling was not active in sscs in vitro and in most spermatogonia in vivo. nonetheless, a pan-wnt antagonist significantly reduced ssc activity in vitro, suggesting that some wnt molecules exist in our serum-free culture system and contribute to ssc maintenance. here, we report that wnt5a promotes ssc activity. we found that wnt5a-expressing fibroblasts supported ssc activity better than those not expressing wnt5a in culture, and that recombinant wnt5a stimulated ssc maintenance. furthermore, wnt5a promoted ssc survival in the absence of feeder cells, and this effect was abolished by inhibiting the jun n-terminal kinase cascade. in addition, wnt5a blocked β-catenin-dependent signaling. we detected the expression of wnt5a and potential wnt5a receptors in sertoli cells and stem/progenitor spermatogonia, respectively. these results indicate that wnt5a is a cell-extrinsic factor that supports ssc self-renewal through β-catenin-independent mechanisms.
modified apolipoprotein (apo) a-i by artificial sweetener causes severe premature cellular senescence and atherosclerosis with impairment of functional and structural properties of apoa-i in lipid-free and lipid-bound state non-enzymatic glycation of serum apolipoproteins is a main feature of diabetes mellitus under hyperglycemia. advanced glycation end products are implicated in the development of aging and metabolic syndrome, including premature atherosclerosis in diabetic subjects. apoa-i is the principal protein constituent of hdl. in this study, glycated human apoa-i (ga-i) by fructation was characterized on functional and structural correlations in lipid-free and lipid-bound states. the ga-i showed more spontaneous multimeric band formation up to pentamer and exhibited slower elution profile with more degraded fragments from fast protein liquid chromatography. the ga-i showed modified secondary structure from fluorescence and circular dichroism analysis. reconstituted high-density lipoprotein (rhdl) containing the ga-i had less content of phospholipid with a much smaller particle size than those of rhdl-containing na-i (na-i-rhdl). the rhdl containing ga-i (ga-i-rhdl) consisted of less molecular number of apoa-i than na-i-rhdl with decreased alpha-helical content. treatment of the ga-i-rhdl induced more atherogenic process in macrophage cell and premature senescence in human dermal fibroblast cell. conclusively, fructose-mediated apoa-i glycation resulted in severe loss of several beneficial functions of apoa-i and hdl regarding anti-senescence and anti-atherosclerosis activities due to a lack of anti-oxidant activity with increased susceptibility of protein degradation and structural modification.
bronchial reactivity to histamine is correlated with airway remodeling in adults with moderate to severe asthma airway inflammation, airflow obstruction, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness are characteristic phenotypic features of asthma. clinically, airflow obstruction in asthma often is not fully reversible, and many asthmatic subjects experience an accelerated and progressive loss of lung function over time. histopathologic studies of the asthmatic airway have demonstrated stereotypic changes that might explain the loss of lung function that many patients with asthma experience. the notion of airway remodeling in asthma postulates that the alteration of the structure and function of key airway constituents, including airway smooth muscle, epithelium, blood vessels, and mucus glands, might explain, at least in part, the progressive loss of lung function that is observed clinically. inflammation driven by cd4(+) lymphocytes and mediated by effector cells, particularly the eosinophil, appears to modulate the function of mesenchymal cells, including fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, changing the composition of the airway wall matrix. changes in the airway epithelium might alter the function of the underlying smooth muscle and the composition of the matrix and could drive inflammation. alterations in the structure and function of airway smooth muscle change the mechanical properties of the airway wall and might also affect the function of other airway constituents. a variety of experimental models have identified candidate mechanisms and mediators for these observed changes, which are thus potential therapeutic targets. however, clinical studies to date have been disappointing, and it remains to be seen whether targeted therapies will prevent the progressive loss of lung function seen in asthma.
prominent crista terminalis and eustachian ridge in the right atrium: two dimensional (2d) and three dimensional (3d) imaging. we evaluated the diagnostic use of a real-time 3-dimensional (3d) echocardiographic system in 106 patients referred for echocardiography during a 4-month period. real-time 3d echocardiography was performed and recorded in parallel with a routine, comprehensive 2-dimensional (2d) study. the diagnoses were exclusively on the basis of 2d findings. the 3d volumes were sliced offline in the 3 dimensions to selectively display specific cardiac structures and reviewed independent of the 2d findings. the 3d studies were graded as: a, new finding not on 2d studies; b, useful anatomic perspective; c, equivalent to 2d studies; or d, missed 2d findings. compared with 2d echocardiography, 3d echocardiography was graded a in 7 (7%), b in 19 (18%), c in 65 (61%), and d in 15 (14%) cases. in the 26 grade-a and grade-b studies, mitral valve disease and congenital heart disease accounted for 16 (61%) cases. suboptimal image quality was present in 7 (47%) of the 15 grade-d studies. thus, real-time 3d echocardiography yields anatomic information comparable with conventional 2d echocardiography in the majority of patients. it can provide new and useful anatomic insight, particularly in patients with mitral valve disease and congenital heart disease. suboptimal image quality remains a problem for real-time 3d echocardiography in some patients.

evidence for peroxynitrite as a signaling molecule in flow-dependent activation of c-jun nh2-terminal kinase. shear stress differentially regulates production of many vasoactive factors at the level of gene expression in endothelial cells that may be mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinases, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) and n-terminal jun kinase (jnk). here we show, using bovine aortic endothelial cells (baec), that shear stress differentially regulates erk and jnk by mechanisms involving gi2 and pertussis toxin (ptx)-insensitive g-protein-dependent pathways, respectively. shear activated erk with a rapid, biphasic time course (maximum by 5 min and basal by 30-min shear exposure) and force dependence (minimum and maximum at 1 and 10 dyn/cm2 shear stress, respectively). ptx treatment prevented shear-dependent activation of erk1/2, consistent with a gi-dependent mechanism. in contrast, jnk activity was maximally turned on by a threshold level of shear force (0.5 dyn/cm2 or higher) with a much slower and prolonged time course (requiring at least 30 min to 4 h) than that of erk. also, ptx had no effect on shear-dependent activation of jnk. to further define the shear-sensitive erk and jnk pathways, vectors expressing hemagglutinin epitope-tagged erk (ha-erk) or ha-jnk were co-transfected with other vectors by using adenovirus-polylysine in baec. expression of the mutant αi2(g203), antisense gαi2 and a dominant negative ras (n17ras) prevented shear-dependent activation of ha-erk, while that of αi2(g204) and antisense αi3 did not. expression of a gβ/γ scavenger, the carboxyl terminus of β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βark-ct), and n17ras inhibited shear-dependent activation of ha-jnk. treatment of baec with genistein prevented shear-dependent activation of erk and jnk, indicating the essential role of tyrosine kinase(s) in both erk and jnk pathways. these results provide evidence that 1) gi2-protein, ras, and tyrosine kinase(s) are upstream regulators of shear-dependent activation of erk and 2) that shear-dependent activation of jnk is regulated by mechanisms involving gβ/γ, ras, and tyrosine kinase(s).
can translocated native fishes retain their trophic niche when confronted with a resident invasive background stable isotope analysis is increasingly being utilised across broad areas of ecology and biology. key to much of this work is the use of mixing models to estimate the proportion of sources contributing to a mixture such as in diet estimation. methodology by accurately reflecting natural variation and uncertainty to generate robust probability estimates of source proportions, the application of bayesian methods to stable isotope mixing models promises to enable researchers to address an array of new questions, and approach current questions with greater insight and honesty. conclusions we outline a framework that builds on recently published bayesian isotopic mixing models and present a new open source r package, siar. the formulation in r will allow for continued and rapid development of this core model into an all-encompassing single analysis suite for stable isotope research.
provision of breast cancer care and survival in germany – results from a population-based high resolution study from saarland evidence suggests that compared to younger women, older women are less likely to receive standard management for breast cancer. whether this disparity persists once differences in tumour characteristics have been adjusted for has not been investigated in the uk. a retrospective cohort study involving case note review was undertaken, based on the north western cancer registry database of women aged ⩾65 years, resident in greater manchester with invasive breast cancer registered over a 1-year period (n=480). adjusting for tumour characteristics associated with age by logistic regression analyses, older women were less likely to receive standard management than younger women for all indicators investigated. compared to women aged 65–69 years, women aged ⩾80 years with operable (stage 1–3a) breast cancer have increased odds of not receiving triple assessment (or=5.5, 95% confidence interval (ci): 2.1–14.5), not receiving primary surgery (or=43.0, 95% ci: 9.7–191.3), not undergoing axillary node surgery (or=27.6, 95% ci: 5.6–135.9) and not undergoing tests for steroid receptors (or=3.0, 95% ci: 1.7–5.5). women aged 75–79 years have increased odds of not receiving radiotherapy following breast-conserving surgery compared to women aged 65–69 years (or=11.0, 95% ci: 2.0–61.6). these results demonstrate that older women in the uk are less likely to receive standard management for breast cancer, compared to younger women and this disparity cannot be explained by differences in tumour characteristics.
discovery of dual-action membrane-anchored modulators of incretin receptors g-protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs) represent the largest constellation of validated drug targets. crystal structures of class a gpcrs have facilitated major advances in understanding the principles underlying gpcr activation. by contrast, relatively little is known about class b gpcrs, a family of receptors for a variety of therapeutically relevant peptide hormones. encouraging progress has recently been made through the structural elucidation of several extracellular hormone-binding domains of class b gpcrs in complex with their natural ligands or synthetic analogues. the structures reveal similar modes of ligand binding, with concomitant alpha-helical structuring of the ligand. the latter suggests an attractive mechanical model for class b gpcr activation.
cholinergic modulation of synaptic transmission and postsynaptic excitability in the rat gracilis dorsal column nucleus the functional properties, ionic basis, and possible convergence and interaction of postsynaptic actions mediated by muscarinic and alpha 1- adrenergic receptors were examined in cat and guinea pig dorsal lateral geniculate (lgnd) neurons maintained in thalamic slices in vitro. the possible involvement of gtp-binding proteins was also examined. extracellular recordings from cat lgnd revealed the presence of two subpopulations of neurons. the most prevalent generated rhythmic high- frequency (300–500 hz) bursts of two to six action potentials each, with an interburst frequency of 1–3 hz. intracellular recordings revealed that this activity is typical of thalamocortical relay cells in the apparent absence of neuromodulatory input. application of ach or noradrenaline (na) to rhythmically oscillating neurons in the cat lgnd resulted in cessation of this activity followed by the appearance of single spike firing. intracellular recordings revealed that this change in firing mode was associated with a depolarization of the neuron out of the range of intrinsic rhythmic oscillation and into or near the single spike firing mode. the voltage characteristics of the current underlying the cholinergic and noradrenergic slow depolarization were investigated in guinea pig lgnd neurons. application of the muscarinic agonist acetyl-beta-methylcholine (mch) to presumed relay neurons resulted in a hyperpolarization due to the activation of an outward k+ current. this response was followed by a slow depolarization due to reduction of a relatively non-voltage-dependent potassium current distinct from im and iahp. application of na resulted in a slow depolarization that was also associated with reduction of this relatively linear k+ current. the mch- and na-induced slow depolarizations displayed the property of occlusion, indicating convergence of action. however, these responses were mediated by pharmacologically distinct receptors since the mch-induced reduction in k+ current was blocked by scopolamine while that induced by na was blocked by the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin. intracellular diffusion of gtp-gamma-s resulted in the inward current responses to na and mch being irreversible, suggesting the possible involvement of a g- protein. prior exposure to pertussis toxin did not affect the inward current response to na and mch, while the outward k+ current responses induced by application of mch or the gabab agonist baclofen were blocked. these results reveal that activation of muscarinic or alpha 1- adrenergic postsynaptic receptors in the lgnd result in a shift in firing mode from rhythmic oscillation to tonic single spike activity through a decrease in a relatively linear k+ current mediated through a pertussis toxin-insensitive g-protein.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
alterations in somatostatin mrna expression in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. background markers of gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba) neurotransmission seem to be altered in the prefrontal cortex (pfc) of subjects with schizophrenia. we sought to determine whether the expression of the messenger rna (mrna) for the synthesizing enzyme of gaba, glutamic acid decarboxylase67 (gad67), is decreased in the pfc of subjects with schizophrenia, whether this change is present in all or only some gaba neurons, and whether long-term treatment with haloperidol decanoate contributes to altered gad67 mrna expression.   methods tissue sections from 10 pairs of subjects with schizophrenia and control subjects and 4 pairs of haloperidol-treated and control monkeys were processed for in situ hybridization histochemical analysis with sulfur-35-labeled oligonucleotide probes for gad67 mrna and exposed to nuclear emulsion. within each layer of pfc area 9, neurons expressing a detectable level of gad67 mrna were quantified for cell density and the relative level of mrna expression per cell (grain density per neuron).   results in subjects with schizophrenia, the density of labeled neurons was significantly (p<.05) decreased by 25% to 35% in cortical layers 3 to 5. in contrast, the mean grain density per labeled neuron did not differ across subject groups. similar analyses in monkeys revealed no effect of long-term haloperidol treatment on either the density of the labeled neurons or the grain density per labeled neuron.   conclusions these findings indicate that in subjects with schizophrenia, gad67 mrna expression is relatively unaltered in most pfc gaba neurons but is reduced below a detectable level in a subset of gaba neurons. altered gaba neurotransmission in this subset may contribute to pfc dysfunction in subjects with schizophrenia.
nonsynonymous polymorphisms of the pdlim5 gene association with the occurrence of both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia single-point mutation in genome, for example, single-nucleotide polymorphism (snp) or rare genetic mutation, is the change of a single nucleotide for another in the genome sequence. some of them will produce an amino acid substitution in the corresponding protein sequence (missense mutations); others will not. this paper focuses on genetic mutations resulting in a change in the amino acid sequence of the corresponding protein and how to assess their effects on protein wild-type characteristics. the existing methods and approaches for predicting the effects of mutation on protein stability, structure, and dynamics are outlined and discussed with respect to their underlying principles. available resources, either as stand-alone applications or webservers, are pointed out as well. it is emphasized that understanding the molecular mechanisms behind these effects due to these missense mutations is of critical importance for detecting disease-causing mutations. the paper provides several examples of the application of 3d structure-based methods to model the effects of protein stability and protein-protein interactions caused by missense mutations as well.
a global perspective on last glacial maximum to holocene climate change a sediment core from the western tropical atlantic covering the last 21,000 yr has been analysed for centennial scale reconstruction of sea surface temperature (sst) and ice volume-corrected oxygen isotopic composition of sea water (delta(18)o(ivc-sw)) using mg/ca and delta(18)o of the shallow dwelling planktonic foraminifer globigerinoides ruber (white). at a period between 15.5 and 17.5 kyrbp, the mg/ca sstand delta(18)o(ivc-sw), a proxy for sea surface salinity (sss), reveals a warming of around 2.5 degrees c along with all increase in salinity. a second period of pronounced warming and sss increase occurred between 11.6 and 13.5 kyr bp. within age model uncertainties, both warming intervals were synchronous with air temperature increase over antarctica and ice retreat in the southern south atlantic and terminated with abrupt centennial scale sss decrease and slight sst cooling in conjunction with interglacial reactivation of the meridional overturning circulation (moc). we suggest that during these warm intervals, production of saline and warm water of the north brazil current resulted in pronounced heat and salt accumulation, and was associated with warming in the southern atlantic, southward displacement of the intertropical convergence zone and weakened moc. at the termination of the younger dryas and heinrich event 1, intensification of cross-equatorial heat and salt transport caused centennial scale cooling and freshening of the western tropical atlantic surface water. this study shows that the western tropical atlantic served as a heat and salt reservoir during deglaciation. the sudden release of accumulated heat and salt at the end of younger drays and heinrich event 1 may have contributed to the rapid reinvigoration of the atlantic moc.

precision and reliability in animal navigation many animals regularly return to particular locations such as hives, nests, wintering grounds or cache sites. this ability clearly implies that animals possess information that allows them to find a route from their current location to their goal. however, the nature of this information is, in many cases, unknown. one particularly important issue is whether this information encodes at least some of the geometric relationships among real-world objects, which would meet a strict definition of a cognitive map. are animals sensitive to such geometric relationships? although there is clear evidence that animals can learn vectors that represent a goal location in terms of absolute distance and direction to a landmark, there is little evidence of any ability to extract abstract geometric rules. here we report data demonstrating that the corvid clark's nutcracker (nucifraga columbiana) can learn to find the point halfway between two landmarks that vary in the distance that separates them. this learning is based on a general principle, as the birds correctly find the halfway point when the landmarks are presented with new distances between them. this demonstrates the ability to find a point defined not by the relationship between a goal and a landmark but by the relationship between landmarks. further experiments demonstrate that there were two distinct processes involved in locating the halfway point, the use of directional bearings to find the (hypothetical) line connecting the landmarks and finding the correct place along that line.
recent progress on computable bounds and the simple slice sampler a new approach to monte carlo simulations is presented, giving a highly efficient method of simulation for large systems near criticality. the algorithm violates dynamic universality at second-order phase transitions, producing unusually small values of the dynamical critical exponent.
global assessment of host cell functions involved in the intracellular survival and replication of chlamydia using rna interference in human cells glucocorticoid-induced tnfr (gitr) has been implicated as an essential regulator of immune responses to self tissues and pathogens. we have recently shown that gitr-induced cellular events promote survival of naive t cells, but are insufficient to protect against activation-induced cell death. however, the molecular mechanisms of gitr-induced signal transduction that influence physiologic and pathologic immune responses are not well understood. tnfr-associated factors (trafs) are pivotal adapter proteins involved in signal transduction pathways of tnfr-related proteins. yeast two-hybrid assays and studies in hek293 cells and primary lymphocytes indicated interactions between traf2 and gitr mediated by acidic residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. gitr-induced activation of nf-κb is blocked by a20, an nf-κb-inducible protein that interacts with trafs and functions in a negative feedback mechanism downstream of other tnfrs. interestingly, in contrast with its effects on signaling triggered by other tnfrs, our functional studies revealed that traf2 plays a novel inhibitory role in gitr-triggered nf-κb activation.
learning and memory deficits consequent to reduction of the fragile x mental retardation protein result from metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated inhibition of camp signaling in drosophila this study was designed to further assess cognitive and affective functioning in a mouse model of fragile x syndrome (fxs), the fmr1(tm1cgr) or fmr1 "knockout" (ko) mouse. male ko mice and wild-type littermate controls were tested on learning set and reversal learning tasks. the ko mice were not impaired in associative learning, transfer of learning, or reversal learning, based on measures of learning rate. analyses of videotapes of the reversal learning task revealed that both groups of mice exhibited higher levels of activity and wall-climbing during the initial sessions of the task than during the final sessions, a pattern also seen for trials following an error relative to those following a correct response. notably, the increase in both behavioral measures seen early in the task was significantly more pronounced for the ko mice than for controls, as was the error-induced increase in activity level. this pattern of effects suggests that the ko mice reacted more strongly than controls to the reversal of contingencies and pronounced drop in reinforcement rate, and to errors in general. this pattern of effects is consistent with the heightened emotional reactivity frequently described for humans with fxs.

feasibility and relevance of level i substation node counts in oropharyngeal carcinoma a retrospective review of 333 previously untreated patients from 1965 to 1986, with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx or hypopharynx, was undertaken to ascertain the prevalence of neck node metastases by neck level. the 333 patients underwent 344 classical radical neck dissections. patients were grouped by clinical neck status at the time of neck dissection: elective dissection in the no neck (n = 71), and immediate therapeutic dissection in the n+ neck (n = 259). detailed analysis was performed for each group based on the specific primary site. this revealed a predominance of neck node metastases in levels ii, iii, and iv for both oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal primaries. isolated “skip” metastases outside of levels ii, iii, or iv occurred in only 1 patient (0.3%). otherwise, level i or v involvement was always associated with nodal metastases at other levels (ie, n2 disease). these data support the trend toward selective limited neck dissection (anterior modified) in no patients. furthermore, they provide the foundation for planning of future prospective trials to assess the efficacy of modifications in the extent of neck dissection for carcinomas of the oropharynx or hypopharynx.
solute sorting in grass leaves: the transpiration stream the concentrations of vacuolar solutes in different cells of the upper epidermis of the third leaf of barley (hordeum vulgare l.) were studied in leaves of different ages grown under different irradiances (120 or 400 μmol photons·m−2·s−1). vacuolar saps were extracted from individual cells located at various positions between adjacent veins and were analysed for their osmolality and the concentrations of k+, ca2+, cl−, no3− and malate. each ion showed a cell-specific distribution within the epidermis that was both quantitatively and qualitatively dependent on the leaf developmental stage and on the light level. during leaf ageing, ca2+ accumulated preferentially in interstomatal cells (i.e. those located between longitudinally adjacent stomata) at concentrations up to 180 mm. under low light conditions, this was accompanied by a more or less equal decrease in k+ concentration. epidermal malate was found only in plants grown continuously or transiently under the high irradiance and reached highest concentrations in trough and interstomatal cells (60 to 150mm). chloride concentration was highest in cells overlying the veins (designated as ridge cells) and lowest in cells located between the veins (trough cells), while no3− exhibited the reverse distribution, although the precise patterns were age-dependent. epidermal osmolality increased with age, but the intercellular differences in the osmolalities were small compared to differences in vacuolar solute composition. a cell-to-cell analysis of the region surrounding the stomata showed that the steepest changes in the vacuolar solute composition of epidermal cells occurred at the boundary between ridge or trough cells and the adjacent near-stomatal cells.
orientation and direction selectivity of synaptic inputs in visual cortical neurons a diversity of combinations produces spike tuning stimulus-specific response properties, such as direction or orientation selectivity, were studied intracellularly in cells recorded from area 17 of the cat. in all 5 direction selective complex cells and one orientation selective simple cell successfully studied, visually evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (epsps) were tuned to the preferred direction or orientation. visually evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (ipsps) were also tuned to the preferred direction/orientation of stimulus. ipsps evoked by the non-preferred stimulus when present were smaller than those evoked by the preferred stimulus. ipsps were undetected in two of the 5 cells tested. these results suggest that directionally/orientationally tuned epsps make a major contribution to stimulus specificity in visual cortical neurons but ipsps evoked by a stimulus with null-direction/orientation may sharpen the stimulus specificity.
new insulin glargine 300 u/ml versus glargine 100 u/ml in japanese adults with type 1 diabetes using basal and mealtime insulin: glucose control and hypoglycaemia in a randomized controlled trial (edition jp 1) objective insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes still provides suboptimal outcomes. insulin glargine 300 units/ml (gla-300), with a flatter pharmacodynamic profile compared with insulin glargine 100 units/ml (gla-100), is an approach to this problem. research design and methods people with type 1 diabetes, using a mealtime and basal insulin regimen, were randomized open-label to gla-300 or gla-100 and to morning or evening injection, continuing the mealtime analog, and followed for 6 months. results participants (n = 549) were a mean age of 47 years and had a mean duration of diabetes of 21 years and bmi of 27.6 kg/m2. the change in hba1c (primary end point; baseline 8.1%) was equivalent in the two treatment groups (difference, 0.04% [95% ci −0.10 to 0.19]) (0.4 mmol/mol [−1.1 to 2.1]), and gla-300 was thus noninferior. similar results with wider 95% cis were found for morning and evening injection times and for prebreakfast self-measured plasma glucose (smpg) overall. results were also similar for gla-300 when morning and evening injection time was compared, including overlapping 8-point smpg profiles. hypoglycemia did not differ, except for the first 8 weeks of the study, when nocturnal confirmed or severe hypoglycemia was lower with gla-300 (rate ratio 0.69 [95% ci 0.53–0.91]). hypoglycemia with gla-300 did not differ by time of injection. the basal insulin dose was somewhat higher at 6 months for gla-300. the adverse event profile did not differ and was independent of the gla-300 time of injection. weight gain was lower with gla-300. conclusions in long-duration type 1 diabetes, gla-300 provides similar glucose control to gla-100, with a lower risk of hypoglycemia after transfer from other insulins, independent of time of injection, and less weight gain.
silibinin inhibits colorectal cancer growth by inhibiting tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis. endothelium-derived relaxing factor (edrf) is a labile humoral agent which mediates the action of some vasodilators. nitrovasodi-lators, which may act by releasing nitric oxide (no), mimic the effect of edrf and it has recently been suggested by furchgott1 that edrf may be no. we have examined this suggestion by studying the release of edrf and no from endothelial cells in culture. no was determined as the chemiluminescent product of its reaction with ozone2. the biological activity of edrf and of no was measured by bioassay3. the relaxation of the bioassay tissues induced by edrf was indistinguishable from that induced by no. both substances were equally unstable. bradykinin caused concentration-dependent release of no from the cells in amounts sufficient to account for the biological activity of edrf. the relaxations induced by edrf and no were inhibited by haemoglobin and enhanced by superoxide dismutase to a similar degree. thus no released from endothelial cells is indistinguishable from edrf in terms of biological activity, stability, and susceptibility to an inhibitor and to a potentiator. we suggest that edrf and no are identical.
cross-channel co-occurrence matrices for robust characterization of surface disruptions in 21/2d rail image analysis we present an approach to high-resolution rail surface analysis combining 2d image texture classification and 21/2d analysis of surface disruptions. detailed analysis of images of rail surfaces is used to observe the condition of rails and, as a precaution, to avoid rail breaks and further damage. single rails are observed by a color line scan camera at high resolution of approximately 0.2 millimeters and under special illumination in order to enable 21/2d image analysis. gabor filter banks are used for 2d texture description and classes are modeled by gaussian mixtures. a bayesian classifier, which also incorporates background knowledge, is used to differentiate between surface texture classes. classes which can be related to surface disruptions are derived from the analysis of the anti-correlation properties between two color channels. images are illuminated by two light sources mounted at different position and operating at different wavelengths. results for data gathered in the vienna metro system are presented.
the efficacy of colour cues in facilitating adaptation to opposing visuomotor rotations the relationship between implicit and explicit processes during motor learning, and for visuomotor adaptation in particular, is poorly understood. we set up a conflict between implicit and explicit processes by instructing subjects to counter a visuomotor rotation using a cognitive strategy in a pointing task. specifically, they were told the exact nature of the directional perturbation, a rotation that directed them 45° counterclockwise from the desired target, and they were instructed to counter it by aiming for the neighboring clockwise target, 45° away. subjects were initially successful in completely negating the rotation with this strategy. surprisingly, however, they were unable to sustain explicit control and made increasingly large errors to the desired target. the cognitive strategy failed because subjects simultaneously adapted unconsciously to the rotation to the neighboring target. notably, the rate of implicit adaptation to the neighboring target was not significantly different from rotation adaptation in the absence of an opposing explicit strategy. these results indicate that explicit strategies cannot substitute for implicit adaptation to a visuomotor rotation and are in fact overridden by the motor planning system. this suggests that the motor system requires that planned and executed trajectories remain congruous in visual space, and enforces this correspondence even at the expense of an opposing explicit task goal.
are ticks venomous animals? the tick, ornithodoros savignyi has been implicated in inducing paralysis and tampan toxicosis. in this study, a basic toxin (tsgp4) was identified and the presence of an acidic toxin (tsgp2) was confirmed. both basic and acidic toxins were more lethal than previously described, with tsgp4 (34microg) and tsgp2 (24microg) causing mortality of adult mice within 30min. pathological effects on the cardiac system, notably of salivary gland extract on an isolated rat heart perfusion system and of purified toxins on mouse electrocardiogram patterns could be observed. tsgp4 caused mobitz type ventricular block, while tsgp2 induced ventricular tachycardia. conversely, fractions from reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography preparations caused paralysis-like symptoms of the limbs after only 48h. the toxins also differ from previously described tick paralysis toxins in terms of molecular behavior and properties. these results indicate that tampan toxicoses and tick paralysis are unrelated pathogenic phenomena.
the methodological quality of systematic reviews comparing temporomandibular joint disorder surgical and non-surgical treatment in permanent temporomandibular disc displacement (tmj-dd) outcome studies many authors claim positive effects of arthroscopic surgery, arthrocentesis and physical therapy. this literature review was undertaken to analyse whether the claimed effects are based on acceptable methodology. the recorded papers were analysed by two independent observers according to (1) method of investigation, (2) therapeutic intervention studied, (3) therapeutic outcome variables used, and (4) claimed effectiveness of the intervention. agreement between observers was calculated. twenty-four papers were found in which therapeutic outcome of interventions on temporomandibular disorders were studied. six studies applied a true experimental design. each of these six studies compared a different set of interventions. twenty-two papers used maximal mouth opening (mmo) as an outcome variable, nine studied pain intensity on a visual analogue scale, one paper assessed the mandibular function impairment questionnaire. kappa for overall agreement concerning the reviewing criteria was 0.82 (p < or = 0.001). no distinguishing effects on mmo, pain or function impairment were reported between arthroscopic surgery, arthrocentesis and physical therapy. results of methodological sound outcome studies evaluating the effects of arthroscopic surgery, arthrocentesis and physical therapy are needed.
constitutive activation of mitogen-activated protein (map) kinases in human renal cell carcinoma. an explosion of new information linking activation of cell surface signal initiators to changes in gene expression has recently emerged. the focus of much of this information has centered around the agonist-dependent activation of the mitogen-activated protein (map) kinases. although this intracellular signal transduction pathway is extremely complex, conservation of many of its components has been observed in yeast, nematodes, drosophila, and mammals. thus, these signaling proteins may participate in the regulation of a variety of cellular processes.
wild type mesenchymal cells contribute to the lung pathology of lymphangioleiomyomatosis the green fluorescence protein (gfp) from the ubi‐gfp/bl6 transgenic line was bred into c57bl/6j‐scid and c.b‐17‐scid mice for investigating host‐tumor cell interactions. these mice express high levels of gfp under the control of the ubiquitin promoter in virtually all cells examined. in tumor tissue generated by implanting tumor cells in the gfp transgenic scid mice, the tumor cells and tumor‐associated murine host cells were clearly distinguished by gfp expression. a population of cells expressing the endothelial cell marker vegfr‐2/flk‐1, and the progenitor markers c‐kit and sca‐1, were incorporated into tumor tissue. the majority of the flk‐1‐positive cells were hematopoietic‐derived cells that coexpressed cd45. to investigate the contribution of bone marrow‐derived cells to the formation of tumor vessels and stroma, tumor cells were implanted in nontransgenic scid mice that received a bone marrow transplant from gfp‐expressing scid mice. although gfp‐positive cells were readily detected by histology in tumors taken from bone marrow transplanted animals, they were spatially isolated and lacked organization. in contrast, if tumors were implanted in nontransgenic scid mice adjacent to a patch of transplanted gfp‐expressing skin, these tumors recruited gfp‐positive cells that organized into tumor vessels. the results demonstrate that hematopoietic‐derived cells, including flk‐1+/ cd45+ cells, readily colonized the tumor stroma but were minimally incorporated in the tumor vasculature. the majority of the tumor vessels were instead recruited from tissue adjacent to the tumor. the expression of flk‐1 on nonendothelial, tumor‐associated host cells raises the possibility that vegf antagonists, such as avastin, could inhibit tumor growth by a mechanism involving hematopoietic‐derived cd45+/flk‐1+ cells, in addition to direct suppression of endothelial cell function.—udagawa, t., puder, m., wood, m., schaefer, b. c., d'amato, r. j. analysis of tumor‐associated stromal cells using scid gfp transgenic mice: contribution of local and bone marrow‐derived host cells. faseb j. 20, 95–102 (2006)
bdnf boosts spike fidelity in chaotic neural oscillations. carbachol, a muscarinic receptor agonist, produced three distinct spontaneous oscillations in the ca3 region of rat hippocampal slices. carbachol concentrations in the 4–13 μm range produced regular synchronized ca3 discharges at 0.5–2 hz (carbachol‐delta). higher concentrations (13–60 μm) produced short episodes of 5–10 hz (carbachol‐theta) oscillations separated by nonsynchronous activity. concentrations of carbachol ranging from 8–25 μm also produced irregular episodes of high‐frequency discharges (carbachol‐gamma, 35–70 hz), in isolation or mixed with carbachol‐theta and carbachol‐delta. at carbachol concentrations sufficient to induce carbachol‐theta, low concentrations of apv reversibly transformed carbachol‐theta into carbachol‐delta. higher concentrations of d,l‐2‐amino‐5‐phosphonopentanoic acid (apv) reversibly and completely blocked carbachol‐theta. a systematic study of the effects of carbachol shows that the frequency of spontaneous oscillations depended nonlinearly on the level of muscarinic activation. field and intracellular recordings from ca1 and ca3 pyramidal cells and interneurons during carbachol‐induced rhythms revealed that the hippocampal circuitry preserved in the slice was capable of spontaneous activity over the range of frequencies observed in vivo and suggests that the presence of these rhythms could be under neuromodulatory control. hippocampus 10:187–197, 2000 © 2000 wiley‐liss, inc.
immunohistochemical characterization and quantification of lymphocytes infiltrating bovine lungs in east coast fever there is strong evidence that class i mhc-restricted parasite-specific cd8+ ctl protect cattle against the protozoan parasite theileria parva. as part of an effort to develop a subunit vaccine for the induction of these responses, we have investigated the factors involved in the generation of t. parva-specific ctl in cattle. purified populations of bovine immune and naive cd8+ t cells were cocultured with autologous t. parva-infected lymphoblasts (tpl) in the presence or absence of immune cd4+ t cells or cytokine preparations. neither population developed ctl activity when cultured with tpl alone, whereas incorporation of immune cd4+ t cells in the cultures supported the generation of parasite-specific ctl from both immune and naive cd8+ precursors. the helper function of parasite-specific cd4+ t cells for immune, but not naive, ctl precursors could be replaced by cd4+ t cells responding to an unrelated ag or by the addition of t cell growth factors or recombinant bovine il-2. in experiments with two-chamber culture plates, in which cocultures of cd4+ and cd8+ t cells with tpl were separated by a semipermeable membrane, ctl activity was observed to develop only in immune precursor populations. hence, although bovine t. parva-specific cd8+ memory t cells need no helper signals other than il-2 for activation, their naive counterparts require close contact with responding parasite-specific cd4+ t cells. this may reflect essential receptor-ligand interactions, or alternatively, a requirement for more stringent microenvironmental cytokine conditions.
age-associated alterations of hippocampal place cells are subregion specific aged rats perform poorly on spatial learning tasks, a cognitive impairment which has been linked to the failure of hippocampal networks to fully encode changes in the external environment [barnes ca, suster ms, shen j, mcnaughton bl. multistability of cognitive maps in the hippocampus of old rats. nature 1997;388(6639):272-5; wilson ia, ikonen s, gureviciene i, mcmahan rw, gallagher m, eichenbaum h, et al. cognitive aging and the hippocampus: how old rats represent new environments. j neurosci 2004;24(15):3870-8]. to examine whether the impairment in hippocampal processing extends to conditions in which self-motion provides the cues for environmental change, we have analyzed spatial firing patterns of hippocampal pyramidal neurons in young and aged rats, as well as in young rats with selective cholinergic lesions, another model of cognitive aging. the rats walked between two visually identical environments, pitting self-motion cues that indicated environmental change against visual inputs that indicated no differences between environments. our results indicated that place cells in both aged and cholinergic-lesioned rats were equally likely as those of young rats to create new spatial representations in the second compartment. these findings suggest that the hippocampal network of aged rats is able to process changes in internally generated cues without rigidity, but that incomplete processing of external landmark cues may lead to impaired spatial learning.
translation attenuation through eif2alpha phosphorylation prevents oxidative stress and maintains the differentiated state in beta cells. evidence for the physiological functions of ucp2 and ucp3 is critically reviewed. they do not mediate adaptive thermogenesis, but they may be significantly thermogenic under specific pharmacological conditions. there is strong evidence that the mild regulated uncoupling they cause attenuates mitochondrial ros production, protects against cellular damage, and diminishes insulin secretion. evidence that they export fatty acids physiologically is weak. ucp2 and ucp3 are important potential targets for treatment of aging, degenerative diseases, diabetes, and perhaps obesity.
cryptanalysis of grindahl we introduce vsh, very smooth hash, a new s-bit hash function that is provably collision-resistant assuming the hardness of finding nontrivial modular square roots of very smooth numbers modulo an s-bit composite. by very smooth, we mean that the smoothness bound is some fixed polynomial function of s. we argue that finding collisions for vsh has the same asymptotic complexity as factoring using the number field sieve factoring algorithm, i.e., subexponential in s.    vsh is theoretically pleasing because it requires just a single multiplication modulo the s-bit composite per ω(s) message-bits (as opposed to o(logs) message-bits for previous provably secure hashes). it is relatively practical. a preliminary implementation on a 1ghz pentium iii processor that achieves collision resistance at least equivalent to the difficulty of factoring a 1024-bit rsa modulus, runs at 1.1 megabyte per second, with a moderate slowdown to 0.7mb/s for 2048-bit rsa security.    vsh can be used to build a fast, provably secure randomised trapdoor hash function, which can be applied to speed up provably secure signature schemes (such as cramer-shoup) and designated-verifier signatures.
control of rna stability by nrrf, an iron-regulated small rna in neisseria gonorrhoeae. the mtrr transcriptional-regulatory protein is known to repress transcription of the mtrcde operon, which encodes a multidrug efflux pump possessed by neisseria gonorrhoeae that is important in the ability of gonococci to resist certain hydrophobic antibiotics, detergents, dyes, and host-derived antimicrobials. in order to determine whether mtrr can exert regulatory action on other gonococcal genes, we performed a whole-genome microarray analysis using total rna extracted from actively growing broth cultures of isogenic mtrr-positive and mtrr-negative gonococci. we determined that, at a minimum, 69 genes are directly or indirectly subject to mtrr control, with 47 being mtrr repressed and 22 being mtrr activated. rpoh, which encodes the general stress response sigma factor rpoh (sigma 32), was found by dna-binding studies to be directly repressed by mtrr, as it was found to bind to a dna sequence upstream of rpoh that included sites within the rpoh promoter. mtrr also repressed the expression of certain rpoh-regulated genes, but this regulation was likely indirect and a reflection of mtrr control of rpoh expression. inducible expression of mtrr was found to repress rpoh expression and to increase gonococcal susceptibility to hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) and an antibiotic (erythromycin) recognized by the mtrc-mtrd-mtre efflux pump system. we propose that, apart from its ability to control the expression of the mtrcde-encoded efflux pump operon and, as a consequence, levels of gonococcal resistance to host antimicrobials (e.g., antimicrobial peptides) recognized by the efflux pump, the ability of mtrr to regulate the expression levels of rpoh and rpoh-regulated genes also modulates levels of gonococcal susceptibility to h(2)o(2).
antigen 43, the major phase-variable protein of the escherichia coli outer membrane, can exist as a family of proteins encoded by multiple alleles. antigen 43 (ag43) is a prominent hetero-oligomeric protein complex in the outer membrane of escherichia coli. it is composed of two subunits. alpha 43 (m(r) 60, 000) and beta 43 (m(r) 53, 000) in 1:1 stoichiometry. alpha 43 is surface expressed, extends beyond the o-side chains of smooth lipopolysaccharide and is bound to the cell surface through an interaction with beta 43, itself an integral outer membrane protein, alpha 43 shows limited sequence homology with some enterobacterial adhesins. expression of ag43 is subject to reversible phase variation, the rates of variation from the ag43+ve to ag43-ve states in liquid minimal medium being approximately 2.2 x 10(-3), the corresponding rates from ag43-ve to ag43+ve states being approximately 1 x 10(-3). phase switching of genes encoding ag43 are transcriptionally regulated by dna methylation (deoxyadenosine methylase [dam] mutants being "locked off") and by oxyr (oxyr mutants being "locked on"). it is proposed that oxyr acts as a repressor of ag43 transcription by binding to unmethylated gatc sites in the regulatory region of the gene. sequencing and mapping has identified ag43 as the likely product of the metastable flu gene first described in 1980 by diderichsen and responsible for colony form variation in e. coli.
in vitro evaluation of anticancer properties of exopolysaccharides from lactobacillus acidophilus in colon cancer cell lines fungal isolates (aspergillus wentii 1, a. wentii 2, penicillium citrinum, penicillium granulatum) were selected to study their in vitro antioxidant potential by various assay procedures. czapek–dox’s medium was selected for the growth of fungi as it supported the best antioxidant activity based on their ec50 values, p. citrinum was the best followed by p. granulatum, a. wentii 1, and a. wentii 2. the chromatographic analyses showed several compounds possessing antioxidant activity in the fungal extracts. two such compounds were partially purified from p. citrinum which demonstrated potent antioxidant activity, equally effective or better than some of the standard antioxidants.
genomes of two new ammonia-oxidizing archaea enriched from deep marine sediments ammonia-oxidizing archaea are ubiquitous in marine and terrestrial environments and now thought to be significant contributors to carbon and nitrogen cycling. the isolation of candidatus “nitrosopumilus maritimus” strain scm1 provided the opportunity for linking its chemolithotrophic physiology with a genomic inventory of the globally distributed archaea. here we report the 1,645,259-bp closed genome of strain scm1, revealing highly copper-dependent systems for ammonia oxidation and electron transport that are distinctly different from known ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. consistent with in situ isotopic studies of marine archaea, the genome sequence indicates n. maritimus grows autotrophically using a variant of the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutryrate pathway for carbon assimilation, while maintaining limited capacity for assimilation of organic carbon. this unique instance of archaeal biosynthesis of the osmoprotectant ectoine and an unprecedented enrichment of multicopper oxidases, thioredoxin-like proteins, and transcriptional regulators points to an organism responsive to environmental cues and adapted to handling reactive copper and nitrogen species that likely derive from its distinctive biochemistry. the conservation of n. maritimus gene content and organization within marine metagenomes indicates that the unique physiology of these specialized oligophiles may play a significant role in the biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nitrogen.
assembly of hepatitis b virus envelope proteins onto a lentivirus pseudotype that infects primary human hepatocytes the pres domain at the n‐terminus of the large envelope protein (lhbs) of the hepatitis b virus is involved in (i) envelopment of viral nucleocapsids and (ii) binding to the host cell. while the first function suggests a cytosolic location of the pres domain during virion assembly, the function as an attachment site requires its translocation across the lipid bilayer and final exposure on the virion surface. we compared the transmembrane topology of newly synthesized lhbs in the endoplasmic reticulum (er) membrane with its topology in the envelope of secreted virions. protease sensitivity and the absence of glycosylation suggest that the entire pres domain of newly synthesized lhbs remains at the cytosolic side of er vesicles. however, virions secreted from transfected cell cultures or isolated from the blood of persistent virus carriers expose antibody binding sites and proteolytic cleavage sites of the pres domain at their surface in approximately half of the lhbs molecules. thus, pres domains appear to be transported across the viral lipid barrier by a novel post‐translational translocation mechanism to fulfil a dual function in virion assembly and attachment to the host cell.
one species or two? vicariance, lineage divergence and low mtdna diversity in geographically isolated populations of south asian river dolphin uplift of mountains driven by tectonic forces can influence regional climate as well as regional drainage patterns, which in turn control the discharge of eroded sediment to the ocean. but the nature of the interactions between tectonic forces, climate and drainage evolution remains contested. here we reconstruct the erosional discharge from the indus river over the past 30 million years using seismic reflection data obtained from drill core samples from the arabian sea and neodymium isotope data. we find that the source of the indus sediments was dominated by erosion within and north of the indus suture zone until five million years ago; after that, the river began to receive more erosional products from himalayan sources. we propose that this change in the erosional pattern is caused by a rerouting of the major rivers of the punjab into the indus, which flowed east into the ganges river before that time. seismic reflection profiles from the indus fan suggest high mass accumulation rates during the pleistocene epoch partly driven by increased drainage to the indus river after five million years ago and partly by faster erosion linked to a stronger monsoon over the past four million years. our isotope stratigraphy for the indus fan provides strong evidence for a significant change in the geometry of western himalayan river systems in the recent geologic past.
gserf6, an ethylene-responsive factor from glycine soja, mediates the regulation of plant bicarbonate tolerance in arabidopsis nadp-malic enzyme (nadp-me, ec 1.1.1.40) functions in many different pathways in plants, and has recently been implicated in plant defense such as in responses to wounding and uv-b radiation. in this study, we isolated a complementary dna (cdna) clone by using the differential display method and screening of a root cdna library of rice (oryza sativa. l) under carbonate (nahco3) stress, and identified it as one of the rice nadp-me genes (we named it nadp-me2, genbank accession no. ab053295). the 5′ end of nadp-me2 was obtained by the 5′-race method, and the full-length cdna had a length of 2217 bp encoding 593 amino acids. expression of nadp-me2 mrna in roots was induced by stress from carbonates (nahco3 and na2co3), nacl, and environmental ph changes. nadp-me2 transcripts increased during 72-h exposures to nahco3, nacl, and peg stresses. furthermore, nadp-me activities in leaves and roots of rice seedlings increased by more than 50% in the presence of carbonates (nahco3 and na2co3), nacl, and peg. these results indicate that rice nadp-me2 responds to salts and osmotic stresses. transgenic arabidopsis plants over-expressing nadp-me2 were obtained through transformation, screening, northern analysis and in situ nadp-me activity assay. transgenic arabidopsis plants over-expressing nadp-me2 grew well in 1/2 × ms medium with 100 mm nacl or 4% mannitol, whereas growth of wild-type (wt) arabidopsis seedlings was strongly inhibited. in addition, under 125 mm nacl stress, the root lengths of transgenic lines were about twice as long as those of the wt. these results suggest that nadp-me2 has a role in enhancing tolerance of plants to salt and osmotic stress.
distress in couples approached for genetic counseling and brca1/2 testing during adjuvant radiotherapy background: despite the potential importance of communication about genetic testing between test participants and their significant others, little is known about social support and communication between women undergoing brca1 and brca2 testing and their partners.purpose: the aims of this longitudinal study were to examine communication about genetic testing during and following testing and to evaluate whether communication is associated with psychological distress reported by test participants and their partners.methods: participants were 153 women who were undergoing genetic testing and 118 partners of women undergoing testing. relationship communication and distress were evaluated at the time of pretest education and 6 months postdisclosure.results: overall, the decision to undergo testing was discussed by the majority of test participants and partners, and most couples felt their partners were supportive. most women disclosed their results to their partners. longitudinal analyses suggested that less support and protective buffering were associated with greater distress 6 months postdisclosure among test participants, whereas lower comfort in sharing concerns and partner support were associated with lower distress 6 months postdisclosure among partners.conclusions: the results of this study suggest that the majority of couples respond supportively during the test experience, but for a small subset of couples the process can strain the relationship. partner support during this process is important, particularly for test participants dealing with an uninformative test result.
behavioural and medical predictors of bacterial vaginosis recurrence among female sex workers: longitudinal analysis from a randomized controlled trial bacterial vaginosis (bv) is characterized by dramatic changes in the vaginal ecosystem. women without evidence of vaginal infection may exhibit transient changes in their flora. we prospectively followed up women by using diaries and self-obtained vaginal smears to correlate behaviors with changes in flora. the majority of women (38/51, 78%) had significant, although transient, changes. behaviors associated with unstable flora were a history of bv, a greater number of partners, and more frequent episodes of receptive oral sex. only the latter remained significantly associated in the multivariate analysis. variables that were associated with day-to-day variability in the flora included use of vaginal medication, menses, greater number of partners, spermicide use, more frequent vaginal intercourse, and less frequent use of condoms. only a minority of women (11/51, 22%) maintained a "normal" lactobacillus-predominant flora. factors associated with instability of the flora are similar to those epidemiologically associated with bv.
2-octyl-cyanoacrylate glue for fixation of stsg in genitourinary tissue defects due to fournier gangrene: a preliminary trial. background in recent years, the use of synthetic glues has become an established practice in several areas of surgical treatment. for example, they are used in open and laparoscopic surgery and in digestive tract endoscopy, interventional radiology, and vascular neuroradiology. the experiments in this study were aimed at elucidating that suture-based permanent mesh fixation can be replaced by fixation with n-butyl 2-cyanoacrylate glue (glubran2) for surgical repair of abdominal wall hernias.   materials and methods in 25 wistar rats, two hernia defects (1.5 cm in diameter) per animal were created bilaterally in the midline of the abdominal wall. the peritoneum was spared. the lesions were left untreated for 10 d to achieve a chronic condition. then the defects were covered with timesh extralight (2 × 2 cm) and fixed by 30 μl of glubran2 or traditional suture. the time points of sacrifice were 17 and 28 d, 3, 4, and 5 mo. at autopsy, histology and immunohistochemistry were performed to evaluate the inflammatory response and the presence of apoptotic cells respectively.   results mesh fixation was excellent in all samples at each time point. at application sites, the inflammatory reaction was mild with a small number of macrophages and vascularized connective tissue presence around glue and mesh threads. glue residues were observed in histologic sections at each time point. no presence of apoptotic cells was found.   conclusions this study demonstrated that glubran2 can effectively replace traditional suture in mesh fixation without affecting tissue healing and determining a physiological inflammatory reaction at the abdominal wall site.
clustering by authorship within and across documents with its close ties to the web, the ir community is destined to leverage the dissemination and collaboration capabilities that the web provides today. especially with the advent of the software as a service principle, an ir community is conceivable that publishes experiments executable by anyone over the web. a review of recent sigir papers shows that we are far away from this vision of collaboration. the benefits of publishing ir experiments as a service are striking for the community as a whole, and include potential to boost research profiles and reputation. however, the additional work must be kept to a minimum and sensitive data must be kept private for this paradigm to become an accepted practice. to foster experiments as a service in ir, we present a web framework for experiments that addresses the outlined challenges and possesses a unique set of compelling features in comparison to existing solutions. we also describe how our reference implementation is already used officially as an evaluation platform for an established international plagiarism detection competition.
functional dissection of the tbk1 molecular network toll-like receptors (tlrs) are activated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns to induce innate immune responses and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, interferons and anti-inflammatory cytokines. tlrs activate downstream effectors through adaptors that contain toll/interleukin-1 receptor (tir) domains, but the mechanisms accounting for diversification of tlr effector functions are unclear. to dissect biochemically tlr signalling, we established a system for isolating signalling complexes assembled by dimerized adaptors. using myd88 as a prototypical adaptor, we identified tnf receptor-associated factor 3 (traf3) as a new component of tir signalling complexes that is recruited along with traf6. using myeloid cells from traf3- and traf6-deficient mice, we show that traf3 is essential for the induction of type i interferons (ifn) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (il-10), but is dispensable for expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. in fact, traf3-deficient cells overproduce pro-inflammatory cytokines owing to defective il-10 production. despite their structural similarity, the functions of traf3 and traf6 are largely distinct. traf3 is also recruited to the adaptor trif (toll/il-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor-inducing ifn-β) and is required for marshalling the protein kinase tbk1 (also called nak) into tir signalling complexes, thereby explaining its unique role in activation of the ifn response.
enrichment effects on adult cognitive development the authors examined longitudinal change in chess skill using a multilevel model analysis of a large database of active, elite chess players (n = 5,011). parameters estimated from quadratic growth curves indicated that the age of peak performance occurs later in life than originally proposed and that this peak is independent of initial skill level. the findings are also consistent with the hypothesis that aging is slightly kinder to the initially more able, who show milder decline past their peak. higher tournament activity levels predicted higher ratings overall and interacted with age in the initially more able sample, suggesting that activity had smaller effects on rating for older adults. the authors discuss implications of these findings for lifetime changes in skilled performance.
monoallelic loss of the imprinted gene grb10 promotes tumor formation in irradiated nf1+/- mice tumorigenesis requires the interaction between different gene disruptions to convert anormal cell into a cancer cell. these gene disruptions can involve loss of expression ormisexpression of genes through genetic or epigenetic mutations. it is becoming clear that thesedisruptions are not isolated events in the genome, but are affected by genome architecture andthe syntenic relationship of alleles on chromosomes. a better understanding of the genetic andepigenetic changes in cancer is important for the rational design of new therapies. we haverecently shown that background-specific polymorphisms and loci under epigenetic regulationhave a strong effect on cancer susceptibility in a mouse model of astrocytoma. although thesemice carry mutations in p53 and ras signaling pathways (through mutation of the rasgapprotein, nf1), the susceptibility to different tumor types depends strongly on epigeneticregulation and does not show simple mendelian inheritance. our results demonstrate theimportance of genome architecture and how tumorigenesis can be accelerated by concomitantloss or gain of multiple genes in a single chromosome rearrangement. because genomearchitecture is very different between mice and humans, comparing patterns of genomicrearrangement in human cancer and mouse models may help distinguish causal genomic changesfrom correlative changes.
impact of p53 and pdgfr-β expression on metastasis and prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-associated death but has been difficult to study because it involves a series of rare, stochastic events. to capture these events, we developed a sensitive method to tag and track pancreatic epithelial cells in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer. tagged cells invaded and entered the bloodstream unexpectedly early, before frank malignancy could be detected by rigorous histologic analysis; this behavior was widely associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (emt). circulating pancreatic cells maintained a mesenchymal phenotype, exhibited stem cell properties, and seeded the liver. emt and invasiveness were most abundant at inflammatory foci, and induction of pancreatitis increased the number of circulating pancreatic cells. conversely, treatment with the immunosuppressive agent dexamethasone abolished dissemination. these results provide insight into the earliest events of cellular invasion in situ and suggest that inflammation enhances cancer progression in part by facilitating emt and entry into the circulation.
diversity of enterococcus faecalis genotypes from multiple oral sites associated with endodontic failure using repetitive sequence‐based polymerase chain reaction and arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction oligonucleotide probes which match consensus sequences of the repetitive extragenic palindromic (rep) element hybridize to genomic dna of diverse bacterial species. primers based on the rep sequence generate complex band patterns with genomic dna in the polymerase chain reaction (pcr), a technique named rep-pcr. we used rep-pcr with genomic dna to fingerprint 47 isolates of citrobacter diversus. previously, 37 were assigned electrophoretic types (ets) by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and 35 were evaluated by using outer membrane protein profiles. fingerprints were compared by visual inspection and by similarity coefficients (simcs) based on the number of common bands versus total bands between two given isolates. dna fingerprints were highly similar visually for patient pairs and outbreak-related sets. simcs for these were > or = 0.952. fingerprints of isolates with different ets generally were distinctive. among 21 unrelated isolates representing 15 ets, only 6 of 210 comparisons had simcs of > or = 0.952. rep-pcr rapidly generated dna fingerprints which were highly similar for epidemiologically linked isolates of c. diversus and distinct for previously characterized strains within this species. the ability of this method to discriminate between c. diversus isolates with the same biotype was similar to that of multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and outer membrane protein profiles. rep-pcr may be useful in evaluation of apparent outbreaks of this or other bacterial species which possess these extragenic, repetitive elements.
increased parental history of bipolar disorder in the united states: association with early age of onset objective: to compare the prevalence rates of mental disorders among children of parents with bipolar disorder and of parents with no mental disorders. method: seventeen studies, meeting specific selection criteria, were included in the metaanalyses. risks for mental disorders among children were estimated by aggregating raw data from the selected studies. results: results indicate that in comparison with children of parents with no mental disorders, children of parents with bipolar disorder are 2.7 times more likely to develop any mental disorder and 4.0 times more likely to develop an affective disorder. the metaanalyses indicate that during childhood and adolescence, the risks for any mental disorder and for affective disorders in children are consistently but moderately related to having a parent who suffers from bipolar disorder. conclusions: risk factors that could account for the psychopathology observed in children of bipolar parents are explored.
biocompatibility evaluation of densified bacterial nanocellulose hydrogel as an implant material for auricular cartilage regeneration phosphorylcholine (pc)-based polymers have been used in a variety of medical device applications to improve biocompatibility. the use of pc-based materials for biomaterials is associated with low protein adsorption, reduced complement activation, low inflammatory response and cell adhesion. for some medical device applications however, materials that support cell adhesion are also beneficial, allowing host interaction and encouraging full incorporation within the body. as previous studies have suggested that cell adhesion to materials is enhanced by the addition of charge, pc-based polymers have therefore been modified to incorporate various concentrations of cationic charge. in this study, the affect of cationic charge on a range of biological responses was investigated. in vitro assays have been used to assess the adsorption of protein onto the materials surface, the adhesion of mouse fibroblasts and rabbit corneal epithelial cells and the adhesion of human mononuclear cells and granulocytes. the results corroborate previous work showing that pc without charge significantly reduces protein adsorption, cell adhesion and inflammatory cell activation. the addition of cationic charge to pc polymers however, resulted in an increase in all of the above responses. this increase did not however, increase linearly with cationic monomer concentration. the differences in cell adhesion are discussed in terms of differences in protein adsorption, cytotoxicity and/or stability of the different cationic polymer coatings.
kidney histologic alterations in α-galactosidase-deficient mice early renal changes in hemizygous and heterozygous patients with fabry's disease. renal biopsy specimens were obtained for light and electron microscopy in 12 patients with fabry's disease (9 hemizygous males and 3 heterozygous females), ranging in age from 7 to 51yr. renal function and blood pressure were normal in all patients. in hemizygous patients, diffuse glycolipid accumulation was observed early in life in every glomerular, vascular, and interstitial cell; tubules were involved irregularly, predominantly in distal convoluted tubules and henle's loop. in heterozygous females, the glycolipid storage had the same morphological features but was found irregularly, being absent in one patient and present patchily in the 2 others: some cells were normal, others were involved massively. associated degenerative renal changes were present in all patients but one (a heterozygous female) and were clearly age-related. they first affected vessels as round fibrinoid deposits resulting from necrosis of severely involved smooth muscle cells. in older patients, intimal thickening was superimposed, and degenerative glomerular and tubular changes were noted. they may have been related partly to ischemic damage. in addition, mesangial cell necrosis could have contributed to the development of glomerular sclerosis. our findings in heterozy-gotes are consistent with lyon's hypothesis of x chromosome inactivation in each female cell. they suggest that renal glycolipid involvement and urine a-glactosidase activity are closely related. they provide theoretical evidence against the possible benefits of enzyme replacement therapy. lesions renales precoces chez les sujets hemizygotes et heterozygotes atteints de maladie de fabry. les biopsies renales de 12 malades âges de 7 a 51 ans (9 sujets hemizygotes et 3 heterozygotes) ont ete etudiees en microscopie optique et electronique. tous avaient une fonction renale et une pression arterielle normales. chez les sujets de sexe masculin, hemizygotes, l'accumulation de glycolipides est precoce et diffuse, presente dans toutes les cellules glomerulaires, interstitielles et vasculaires. dans les tubes la surcharge est irreguliere et predomine sur les tubes contournes distaux et les anses de henle. chez les femmes transmettrices l'aspect est moins monomorphe: la surcharge est absente chez une malade, elle est presente chez les deux autres mais touche irregulierement les cellules tant glomerulaires, interstitielles et vasculaires que tubulaires. les lesions degeneratives du parenchyme renal, associees a la surcharge, sont presentes dans tous les cas sauf chez une des transmettrices, leur severite est correlee avec l'âge des malades. elles touchent d'abord les vaisseaux sous la forme de depots fibrinoides arrondis presents dans la paroi musculaire des arteres; ces depots sont la consequence de la necrose des cellules musculaires surchargees de glycolipides. chez les sujets plus âges, aux lesions de la media s'associe une endarterite, et des alterations degeneratives glomerulaires et tubulaires apparaissent, probablement secondaires aux alterations vasculaires. la necrose des cellules mesangiales peut egalement intervenir dans la genese des lesions glomerulaires. nos observations chez les heterozygotes sont compatibles avec l'hypothese de m. lyon concernant l'inactivation d'un chromosome x dans chaque cellule feminine. elles suggerent l'existence d'une correlation etroite entre l'importance de la surcharge du parenchyme renal et le taux urinaire d'α-galactosidase. elles jettent un doute sur le benefice qu'on peut attendre des therapeutiques enzymatiques substitutives.
ml0405 and ml2331 are antigens of mycobacterium leprae with potential for diagnosis of leprosy nerve damage is the hallmark of mycobacterium leprae infection, which results from m. leprae invasion of the schwann cell of the peripheral nervous system. we have recently shown that the laminin-2 isoform, specially the g domain of laminin alpha2 chain, on the schwann cell-axon unit serves as an initial neural target for m. leprae. however, m. leprae surface molecules that mediate bacterial invasion of peripheral nerves are entirely unknown. by using human alpha2 laminins as a probe, a major 28-kda protein in the m. leprae cell wall fraction that binds alpha2 laminins was identified. after n-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, pcr-based strategy was used to clone the gene that encodes this protein. deduced amino acid sequence of this m. leprae laminin-binding protein predicts a 21-kda molecule (ml-lbp21), which is smaller than the observed molecular size in sds/page. immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy on intact m. leprae with mabs against recombinant (r) ml-lbp21 revealed that the protein is surface exposed. rml-lbp21 avidly bound to alpha2 laminins, the rg domain of the laminin-alpha2 chain, and the native peripheral nerve laminin-2. the role of ml-lbp21 in schwann cell adhesion and invasion was investigated by using fluorescent polystyrene beads coated with rml-lbp21. although beads coated with rml-lbp21 alone specifically adhered to and were ingested by primary schwann cells, these functions were significantly enhanced when beads were preincubated with exogenous alpha2 laminins. taken together, the present data suggest that ml-lbp21 may function as a critical surface adhesin that facilitates the entry of m. leprae into schwann cells.
visual texture segregation by the chimpanzee (pan troglodytes) if a region composed of one set of texture elements is effortlessly perceived on a background composed of another set, the texture segmentation is said to occur "preattentively". if the time required to find a target item among distractor items is independent of the number of distractor items, the visual search is said to occur with all items processed "in parallel". effortless, preattentive texture segmentation and parallel visual search are sometimes assumed to be equivalent measures of the same parallel processing stage in the visual system. the demonstrations presented here show that this is not the case. parallel processing can occur with stimuli that do not support effortless texture segmentation and vice versa.
moderate doses of conjugated linoleic acid isomers mix contribute to lowering body fat content maintaining insulin sensitivity and a noninflammatory pattern in adipose tissue in mice. adipose tissue may be the source of insulin desensitizing proinflammatory molecules that predispose to insulin resistance. this study investigated whether dietary fatty acids could attenuate the proinflammatory insulin-resistant state in obese adipose tissue. the potential antidiabetic effect of cis-9, trans-11–conjugated linoleic acid (c9,t11-cla) was determined, focusing on the molecular markers of insulin sensitivity and inflammation in adipose tissue of ob/ob c57bl-6 mice. feeding a c9,t11-cla–enriched diet reduced fasting glucose (p < 0.05), insulin (p < 0.05), and triacylglycerol concentrations (p < 0.01) and increased adipose tissue plasma membrane glut4 (p < 0.05) and insulin receptor (p < 0.05) expression compared with the control linoleic acid–enriched diet. interestingly, after the c9,t11-cla diet, adipose tissue macrophage infiltration was less, with marked downregulation of several inflammatory markers in adipose tissue, including reduced tumor necrosis factor-α and cd68 mrna (p < 0.05), nuclear factor-κb (nf-κb) p65 expression (p < 0.01), nf-κb dna binding (p < 0.01), and nf-κb p65, p50, c-rel, p52, and relb transcriptional activity (p < 0.01). to define whether these observations were direct effects of the nutrient intervention, complimentary cell culture studies showed that c9,t11-cla inhibited tumor necrosis factor-α–induced downregulation of insulin receptor substrate 1 and glut4 mrna expression and promoted insulin-stimulated glucose transport in 3t3-l1 adipocytes compared with linoleic acid. this study suggests that altering fatty acid composition may attenuate the proinflammatory state in adipose tissue that predisposes to obesity-induced insulin resistance.
dual effects of single-walled carbon nanotubes coupled with near-infrared radiation on bacillus anthracis spores: inactivates spores and stimulates the germination of surviving spores the alanin‐estimulated spore germination responses of bacillus subtilis 168 have been dissected by combining physiological and genetical approaches. from the analyses the authors infer that there are three classes of alanine response. two of the responses are mediated via the gera proteins, with and without germinal adjuncts, the third is mediated via the gerb proteins and obligately requires adjuncts.
temporally graded activation of neocortical regions in response to memories of different ages the aim of this study was to determine the role of regional cortical thickness in recall of verbal material over an extended time period. mri scans of healthy adults of varying ages were obtained. two scans were averaged per person to achieve high spatial resolution, and a semi-automated method for continuous measurement of thickness across the entire cortical mantle was employed. verbal memory tests assessing recall after 5 min, 30 min, and a mean interval of 83 days were administered. a general linear model (glm) of the effects of thickness at each vertex on the different memory indices was computed, controlling for gender, age, iq, and intracranial volume. these analyses were repeated with hippocampal volume as an additional variable to be controlled for, to assess to which extent effects of cortical thickness were independent of hippocampal size. minute effects of cortical thickness were observed with regard to shorter time intervals (5 and 30 min). however, even when controlling for the effects of hippocampal volume, higher recall across months was associated with thicker cortex of distinct areas including parts of the gyrus rectus, the middle frontal gyrus, the parieto-occipital sulcus and the lingual gyrus of both hemispheres. in addition, hemisphere-specific associations were found in parts of the right temporal and parietal lobe as well as parts of the left precuneus. this supports a unique and critical role of the thickness of distinct cortical areas in recall after months, more than after minutes.
persistence of fecal indicator bacteria in santa monica bay beach sediments. waters adjacent to the county of los angeles (ca) receive untreated runoff from a series of storm drains year round. many other coastal areas face a similar situation. to our knowledge, there has not been a large-scale epidemiologic study of persons who swim in marine waters subject to such runoff. we report here results of a cohort study conducted to investigate this issue. measures of exposure included distance from the storm drain, selected bacterial indicators (total and fecal coliforms, enterococci, and escherichia coli), and a direct measure of enteric viruses. we found higher risks of a broad range of symptoms, including both upper respiratory and gastrointestinal, for subjects swimming (a) closer to storm drains, (b) in water with high levels of single bacterial indicators and a low ratio of total to fecal coliforms, and (c) in water where enteric viruses were detected. the strength and consistency of the associations we observed across various measures of exposure imply that there may be an increased risk of adverse health outcomes associated with swimming in ocean water that is contaminated with untreated urban runoff.
novel mechanism of regulation of protein 4.1g binding properties through ca2+/calmodulin-mediated structural changes red blood cell protein 4.1 (4.1r) is essential for maintaining erythrocyte shape and controlling membrane mechanical properties, such as deformability and stability. the importance of 4.1r has been demonstrated by the dramatic erythrocyte alterations observed in patients lacking this protein. indeed, 4.1r null red blood cells adopt an elliptical shape and are characterized by unstable membranes. the key role of 4.1r likely results from multiple protein-protein interactions: lateral interactions with the spectrin/actin network and vertical interactions with the cytoplasmic domain of transmembrane proteins glycophorin c (gpc), band 3 (anion exchanger 1, ae1), and cd44. 4.1r promotes the formation of a ternary complex with gpc and p55 through its 30 kda membrane-binding domain. based on the primary structure of the prototypical 80 kda isoform of 4.1r, functional domains and sites for binding partners have been identified. the others and we have been focusing on the structure and function of the 30 kda nh2-terminal domain of 4.1r, which is responsible for 4.1r interaction with the transmembrane proteins described above. a major finding is that ca2+, in association with calmodulin (cam), plays a critical role in regulation of the interaction of the 30 kda domain with its various binding partners. this review is a detailed report of our current knowledge regarding 4.1r, and more specifically, 4.1r 30 kda domain: its primary structure, functions and modulation by ca2+ and cam. emphasis is given on the relationships between structure and function that we have been able to establish through x-ray crystal structure analysis of the 30 kda membrane-binding domain in 4.1r. finally, we give insights into the potential roles of 4.1r in the dynamic organization of the membrane skeleton viewed as a complex system.
directed evolution of mycobacterium tuberculosis β-lactamase reveals gatekeeper residue that regulates antibiotic resistance and catalytic efficiency proteins are transported across the bacterial plasma membrane and the chloroplast thylakoid membrane by means of protein translocases that recognize n-terminal targeting signals in their cognate substrates. transport of many of these proteins involves the well defined sec apparatus that operates in both membranes. we describe here the identification of a novel component of a bacterial sec-independent translocase. the system probably functions in a similar manner to a sec-independent translocase in the thylakoid membrane, and substrates for both systems bear a characteristic twin-arginine motif in the targeting peptide. the translocase component is encoded inescherichia coli by an unassigned reading frame,yigu, disruption of which blocks the export of at least five twin-arg-containing precursor proteins that are predicted to bind redox cofactors, and hence fold, prior to translocation. the sec pathway remains unaffected in the deletion strain. the gene has been designated tatc (for twin-argininetranslocation), and we show that homologous genes are present in a range of bacteria, plastids, and mitochondria. these findings suggest a central role for tatc-type proteins in the translocation of tightly folded proteins across a spectrum of biological membranes.
comparison of budesonide/formoterol turbuhaler with fluticasone/salmeterol diskus for treatment effects on small airway impairment and airway inflammation in patients with asthma. aims evidence is accumulating that budesonide (bud) forms intracellular esters in airways. which may affect both duration of action and therapeutic ratio of this drug. the aim of the present paper is to review the preclinical and human experimental evidence supporting the esterification of bud, and to discuss the clinical implications this may have on asthma and rhinitis treatment.   results after inhalation, intact bud binds primarily to available steroid receptors, and mainly excess (unbound) bud is esterified. esterification of bud is a rapid process: within 20 minutes of inhalation in the rat of radiolabeled bud, approximately 80% of radioactivity within the trachea and main bronchi was associated with bud esters, primarily bud oleate. after 4 hours, the proportion of bud esters/total cellular bud was typically 40 to 50% for lung, 70 to 90% for trachea, and only 10 to 15% for peripheral muscle. comparative in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that esterification prolongs bud's anti-inflammatory activity longer than that of corticosteroids that can not form esters. clinical studies have confirmed the prolonged presence of bud esters, as well as intact bud, in human airway tissues: 6 hours postdosing, nasal biopsy concentrations of intact bud were >10-fold greater than those of fluticasone propionate and at 24 hours bud was detectable in threefold more biopsies than fluticasone propionate. the impact of esterification on airway selectivity of bud has also been demonstrated in vivo and using pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models.   conclusions bud is retained in airways as esters, a novel kinetic mechanism for synthetic glucocorticoids. in preclinical studies this esterification is correlated to a prolonged local tissue binding and efficacy, which is not found when the esterification is inhibited by an esterification blocker. because less esters are formed in the systemic compartment than in airways/lung, the local benefit:systemic risk ratio may also be improved by this mechanism. bud possesses favorable clinical properties, including its approved once-daily efficacy in asthma, which is probably in part attributable to esterification. however, a direct proof of the latter in patients requires effective and safe inhibitors of the esterification, which are not yet available. therefore, evidence to support the therapeutic impact of esterification is still circumstantial.
transition from interictal to ictal activity in limbic networks in vitro on the basis of neuroanatomical studies, the entorhinal cortex (ec) has long been regarded as a relay station that provides the major source of afferent input to the hippocampus. the perforant path input to the dentate gyrus from layer ii has traditionally been regarded as the major pathway by which information is transferred. however, electrophysiological studies are now indicating that other elements of the perforant path that project directly to ca1 and ca3 are more important than thought previously, and that the properties of different neuronal elements in the ec may determine the way in which information is passed on to and processed by the hippocampus. this article summarizes some of the properties of synaptic transmission in the ec and speculates on how frequency-dependent changes in transmission may be involved in the pre- and post-processing of hippocampal information by the ec.
cortical mechanics and myosin-ii abnormalities associated with post-ovulatory aging: implications for functional defects in aged eggs. analysis of mouse oocyte mechanics shows that effective tension drops 6-fold from prophase i to metaphase ii; the metaphase ii egg has a 2.5-fold tension differential between the cortex over the spindle and the opposite cortex. manipulation of actin, myosin-ii, or erms alters tension levels and induces spindle abnormalities during meiosis ii.
two-year clinical outcomes after paclitaxel-eluting stent or brachytherapy treatment for bare metal stent restenosis: the taxus v isr trial. background treatment of in-stent restenosis presents a critical limitation of intracoronary stent implantation. ionizing radiation has been shown to decrease neointimal formation within stents in animal models and in initial clinical trials. we studied the effects of intracoronary gamma-radiation therapy versus placebo on the clinical and angiographic outcomes of patients with in-stent restenosis.   methods and results one hundred thirty patients with in-stent restenosis underwent successful coronary intervention and were then blindly randomized to receive either intracoronary gamma-radiation with (192)ir (15 gy) or placebo. four independent core laboratories blinded to the treatment protocol analyzed the angiographic and intravascular ultrasound end points of restenosis. procedural success and in-hospital and 30-day complications were similar among the groups. at 6 months, patients assigned to radiation therapy required less target lesion revascularization and target vessel revascularization (9 [13.8%] and 17 [26.2%], respectively) compared with patients assigned to placebo (41 [63.1%, p=0.0001] and 44 [67.7%, p=0.0001], respectively). binary angiographic restenosis was lower in the irradiated group (19% versus 58% for placebo, p=0.001). freedom from major cardiac events was lower in the radiation group (29.2% versus 67.7% for placebo, p<0.001).   conclusions intracoronary gamma-radiation used as adjunct therapy for patients with in-stent restenosis significantly reduces both angiographic and clinical restenosis.
dopaminergic modulation of auditory cortex-dependent memory consolidation through mtor bilateral rapid‐rate transcranial magnetic stimulation (rtms) of gerbil auditory cortex with a miniature coil device was used to study short‐term and long‐term effects on discrimination learning of frequency‐modulated tones. we found previously that directional discrimination of frequency modulation (rising vs. falling) relies on auditory cortex processing and that formation of its memory depends on local protein synthesis. here we show that, during training over 5 days, certain rtms regimes contingent on training had differential effects on the time course of learning. when rtms was applied several times per day, i.e. four blocks of 5 min rtms each followed 5 min later by a 3‐min training block and 15‐min intervals between these blocks (experiment a), animals reached a high discrimination performance more slowly over 5 days than did controls. when rtms preceded only the first two of four training blocks (experiment b), or when prolonged rtms (20 min) preceded only the first block, or when blocks of experiment a had longer intervals (experiments c and d), no significant day‐to‐day effects were found. however, in experiment a, and to some extent in experiment b, rtms reduced the within‐session discrimination performance. nevertheless the animals learned, as demonstrated by a higher performance the next day. thus, our results indicate that rtms treatments accumulate over a day but not strongly over successive days. we suggest that rtms of sensory cortex, as used in our study, affects short‐term memory but not long‐term memory formation.
social networking and academic performance: a review the quantitative study to explore the most popular amongst saudi students.the study establishes relation among the social media usage and academic grades.poor time management and football also have negative impact on academic grades.normality tests are to find relationship among social media usage and gpa scores.the hypothesis about existence of relationship among gpa and sn is not satisfied. social media is a popular method for communication amongst university students in saudi arabia. however excessive social media use can raise questions about whether academic performance is affected. this research explores this question by conducting a survey on university students in saudi arabia in regards to social media usage and their academic performance. the survey also explored which social network is the most popular amongst saudi students, what students thought about their social media usage and factors besides social media usage which negatively affect academic performance.the survey received 108 responses and descriptive statistics including normality tests i.e. scatter plots were used to examine the relationship between the average number of hours students spent of social media a week and gpa scores of the students. the results demonstrated that there was no linear relationship between social media usage in a week and gpa score. students highlighted that besides social media use, time management is a factor which affects students 'studies negatively.the findings of the paper can be used to propose the effective plans for improving the academic performance of the students in such a way that a balance in the leisure, information exchange and academic performance can be maintained.
atrx loss promotes tumor growth and impairs nonhomologous end joining dna repair in glioma glioblastoma multiforme (gbm) is a lethal brain tumour in adults and children. however, dna copy number and gene expression signatures indicate differences between adult and paediatric cases. to explore the genetic events underlying this distinction, we sequenced the exomes of 48 paediatric gbm samples. somatic mutations in the h3.3-atrx-daxx chromatin remodelling pathway were identified in 44% of tumours (21/48). recurrent mutations in h3f3a, which encodes the replication-independent histone 3 variant h3.3, were observed in 31% of tumours, and led to amino acid substitutions at two critical positions within the histone tail (k27m, g34r/g34v) involved in key regulatory post-translational modifications. mutations in atrx (α-thalassaemia/mental retardation syndrome x-linked) and daxx (death-domain associated protein), encoding two subunits of a chromatin remodelling complex required for h3.3 incorporation at pericentric heterochromatin and telomeres, were identified in 31% of samples overall, and in 100% of tumours harbouring a g34r or g34v h3.3 mutation. somatic tp53 mutations were identified in 54% of all cases, and in 86% of samples with h3f3a and/or atrx mutations. screening of a large cohort of gliomas of various grades and histologies (n = 784) showed h3f3a mutations to be specific to gbm and highly prevalent in children and young adults. furthermore, the presence of h3f3a/atrx-daxx/tp53 mutations was strongly associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres and specific gene expression profiles. this is, to our knowledge, the first report to highlight recurrent mutations in a regulatory histone in humans, and our data suggest that defects of the chromatin architecture underlie paediatric and young adult gbm pathogenesis.
scholarlycommons departmental papers ( be ) department of bioengineering may 2006 e-cadherin engagement stimulates proliferation via rac 1 conclusionscontact inhibition of movement is here defined simply as the stopping of the continued locomotion of a cell in the direction which has produced a collision with another cell; so that one cell does not use another as a substratum. amongst fibroblasts and epithelial cells this inhibition seems to be brought about by a mechanism which it is suggested consists essentially of a spasm of contraction in the region of the contact, set off by some signal from the cell contacted. many other kinds of cells show the general phenomenon of contact inhibition; but there is no certainty that they have the same contractile mechanism.the survey of the literature which this review has entailed suggests that it might be useful to end with four somewhat negative points: (1) contact inhibition as originally defined is not concerned with mitosis. it may of course become so. (2) contact inhibition of movement is difficult to analyse reliably without quantitative estimations and deliberate experiments. anecdotes are not enough. (3) malignant cells are not properly described as being devoid of contact inhibition. it is suggested that they are defective as compared with their cells of origin. (4) from the point of view invasion interest. it is the heterologous inhibition of tumour cells by normal cells that is relevant.
waist circumference cut-off values for the prediction of cardiovascular risk factors clustering in chinese school-aged children: a cross-sectional study objective: the objective of the study was to test the hypothesis that differences in the relationship between percent body fat (%bf) and body mass index (bmi) between populations can be explained (in part) by differences in body build.design: cross-sectional, comparative study.subjects: 120 age, gender and bmi matched singapore chinese, beijing chinese and dutch (wageningen) caucasians.measurements: from body weight and body height, bmi was calculated. relative sitting height (sitting height/height) was used as a measure of relative leg length. body fat was determined using densitometry (underwater weighing) in beijing and wageningen and using a three-compartment model based on densitometry and hydrometry in singapore. wrist and knee widths were measured as indicators for frame size and skeletal mass was calculated based on height, wrist and knee width. in addition, a slenderness index (height/sum of wrist and knee width) was calculated.results: for the same bmi, singapore chinese had the highest %bf followed by beijing chinese and the dutch caucasians. singaporean chinese had a more slender frame than beijing chinese and dutch caucasians. predicted %bf from bmi, using a caucasian prediction formula, was not different from measured %bf in wageningen and in beijing, but in singapore the formula underpredicted %bf by 4.0±0.8% (mean±s.e.m.) compared to wageningen. the difference between measured and predicted %bf (bias) was related to the level of %bf and with measures of body build, especially slenderness. correction for differences in %bf, slenderness and relative sitting height, decreased the differences between measured and predicted values compared to the dutch group from 1.4±0.8 (not statistically significant, ns) to −0.2±0.5 (ns) in beijing and from 4.0±0.8 (p<0.05) to 0.3±0.5 (ns) in singapore (all values mean±s.e.m.).conclusions: the study results confirm the hypothesis that differences in body build are at least partly responsible for a different relationship between bmi and %bf among different (ethnic) groups.
diabetic retinopathy and peripapillary retinal thickness purpose to assess the correlation between the features of optical coherence tomography (oct) and fluorescein angiography in clinically significant diabetic macular edema.   design retrospective observational case series.   methods this study involved 145 eyes (91 patients) with clinically significant diabetic macular edema. the fluorescein angiography features were categorized into focal leakage type, diffuse leakage type, and diffuse cystoid leakage type. the oct features were categorized into four types: type 1, thickening with homogeneous optical reflectivity; type 2, thickening with markedly decreased optical reflectivity in the outer retinal layer; type 3a, foveolar detachment without traction; and type 3b, foveolar detachment with apparent vitreofoveal traction. the correlation between fluorescein angiography types and oct types were analyzed, and their associations with visual acuity, central foveal thickness. and stages of diabetic retinopathy were evaluated.   results the prevalence of oct type 1 was higher in the focal leakage type (73.0%) and in the diffuse leakage type (58.9%) than in the diffuse cystoid leakage type (3.8%) of fluorescein angiography (p <.0001). the prevalence of oct type 2 and 3a was higher in the diffuse cystoid leakage type (57.7% and 34.6%, respectively) than in the focal leakage type (20.6% and 3.2%) or diffuse leakage type(28.6% and 10.7%; p <.0001). the stages of retinopathy correlated with fluorescein angiography types (p =.016). optical coherence tomography type 1 and the focal leakage type of fluorescein angiography showed the least foveal thickness and the best visual acuity (p <.05).   conclusions there was a significant correlation between the features of oct and fluorescein angiography in clinically significant diabetic macular edema. the combined data from both oct and fluorescein angiography may provide a clearer understanding of the anatomic and physiologic characteristics of clinically significant diabetic macular edema.
the effect of contralateral training: influence of unilateral isokinetic exercise on one-legged standing balance of the contralateral lower extremity in adults. the aim of this study was to evaluate balance abilities and electromyographic (emg) latency times of the preferred and nonpreferred leg in soccer players. whereas side differences between the two legs in force, kicking speed, and joint laxity have been demonstrated in athletes in previous studies, no data are so far available on balance differences. low balance ability is generally associated with an increased risk of ligament injuries, and the detection of a possible asymmetry in balance is important because a bilateral difference may be a contributing factor to injury. twenty-one amateur soccer players were tested. two different balance test instruments were used: the biodex stability system and the tetrax system. for the evaluation of muscle latency times, emgs were recorded by means of the equitest system. none of the tests performed in this study revealed statistically significant differences in balance ability between the preferred and the nonpreferred leg. the investigations of balance function and muscle response in amateur soccer players did not reveal significant differences between the preferred and nonpreferred leg in the current study. however, a certain tendency to better balance in the nonpreferred leg was observed.
udp-induced relaxation is enhanced in aorta from female obese otsuka long–evans tokushima fatty rats vascular dysfunction plays a pivotal role in the development of systemic complications associated with arterial hypertension and diabetes. the endothelium, or more specifically, various factors derived from endothelial cells tightly regulate vascular function, including vascular tone. in physiological conditions, there is a balance between endothelium‐derived factors, that is, relaxing factors (endothelium‐derived relaxing factors; edrfs) and contracting factors (endothelium‐derived contracting factors; edcfs), which mediate vascular homeostasis. however, in disease states, such as diabetes and arterial hypertension, there is an imbalance between edrf and edcf, with a reduction of edrf signalling and an increase of edcf signalling. among edcfs, cox‐derived vasoconstrictor prostanoids play an important role in the development of vascular dysfunction associated with hypertension and diabetes. moreover, uridine adenosine tetraphosphate (up4a), identified as an edcf in 2005, also modulates vascular function. however, the role of up4a in hypertension‐ and diabetes‐associated vascular dysfunction is unclear. in the present review, we focused on experimental and clinical evidence that implicate these two edcfs (vasoconstrictor prostanoids and up4a) in vascular dysfunction associated with hypertension and diabetes.
documentation and quantitative analysis of the local knowledge on medicinal plants in kalrayan hills of villupuram district, tamil nadu, india. ethnomedicinal relevance medicinal plants are treasure of any region for ailment treatment. the present research work was focused to document the indigenous knowledge of unexplored area of wana, south waziristan agency, pakistan. this was the very first study, to explore the potential ethno-medicinal plants of study area.   materials and methods data was collected by opting people participation involving interviews, group meetings, semi structured discussions and filling of questionnaires.   results and discussion a total 50 wild medicinal plants belonging to 30 families were collected. medicinal plants used against the stomach disorders were 10% followed by the cold/cough (8%), hepatitis (7%), diuretic (7%), sedative/narcotic (7%), tonic (6%), asthma (5%), cardiac problems (4%), jaundice (4%) and so on. among plant parts used for indigenous medicines, leaves were (24%) followed by the fruit (15%), root (12%), seed (11%), whole plant (9%), arial parts (8%), flower (6%), rhizome, bark and stem (4%), bulbs (2%) and pods (1%). xanthium strumarium reported the highest use value i.e. 0.95.   conclusion people of wana still rely on indigenous plants for their basic healthcare needs. harvesting of roots and whole plants is a big threat to conservation of medicinal plants diversity.
left ventricular function and remodeling after myocardial infarction in aging rats. this study was designed to answer two questions. first, does the left ventricular contractile dysfunction resulting from mitral regurgitation (mr) reflect a primary defect in the cardiac muscle cell? second, what is the basis for any change in cellular contractile function that might be observed? left ventricular volume overload was produced in 10 dogs by catheter transection of mitral chordae tendineae. three months later in these and in seven control dogs, left ventricular contractile function was characterized by the end-ejection stress-volume relation (eesvr). investigators who were blinded to these results then characterized the contractile performance of cardiac muscle cells, or cardiocytes, from these same left ventricles in terms of the viscosity (graded external load)-velocity relation. finally, the tissue and cellular components of these same left ventricles were analyzed morphometrically. both the left ventricles from the mr group and their constituent cardiocytes showed marked contractile abnormalities. by matching ventricles with cells from the same mr dogs, ventricular eesvr was correlated with cardiocyte peak sarcomere shortening velocity (ssv). the correlation coefficient between eesvr and ssv was 0.63, but between a size-independent measure of active ventricular stiffness and ssv, it was 0.88. no change in left ventricular interstitial volume fraction was found in mr dogs, but both ventricular and cellular contractile dysfunction strongly correlated with a decreased volume fraction of cardiocyte myofibrils. last, in an attempt to relate the degree of contractile dysfunction to the hypertrophic response, left ventricular mass in the mr dogs was correlated with both cellular and ventricular contractile indexes; no significant correlation was found. three conclusions are warranted by these studies. first, chronic left ventricular volume overload from mitral regurgitation leads to contractile defects at both the ventricular and cellular levels, the extent of which correlates well in individual animals. second, no quantitative interstitial change resulted from mr. taken together, these two findings strongly suggest that the contractile defect is intrinsic to the cardiocyte. third, while the contractile abnormality in mr remains undefined, the most basic defects appear to be a combination of myofibrillar loss with the failure of compensatory hypertrophy to occur in response to progressive decrements in cellular and ventricular function.
attenuation estimations using envelope echo data: analysis and simulations. a comparison is made between pulse echo response profiles obtained in water and profiles obtained in a tissue‐mimicking (tm) material for clinical ultrasound transducers. the tm material is assumed to provide a more accurate indication of actual beam profiles in soft tissue because of the presence of frequency‐dependent attenuation in the material. pulse echo response profiles measured in the tm medium demonstrate a reduction in the focal distance and degraded resolution distal to the focal distance, in comparison to profiles obtained in water.
24-gops 4.5-${\rm mm}^{2}$ digital cellular neural network for rapid visual attention in an object-recognition soc a 100gops vision processor lsi (imapcar) for in-vehicle image recognition which consumes less than 2 watts of power has been developed. 128 of 4-way vliw with mac (multiply add accumulation) processor elements (pe) to which data are assigned efficiently by dma companion scaling capability, has achieved high performance in low cost. compared with a previous design, performance for major vision tasks has been improved by a factor of 2.5 while 50% of power is reduced.
inhibition of toll-like receptor signaling in primary murine microglia recent studies indicate that tlrs are critical in generating innate immune responses during infection with hsv-1. in this study, we investigated the role of tlr2 signaling in regulating the production of neuroimmune mediators by examining cytokine and chemokine expression using primary microglial cells obtained from tlr2−/− as well as wild-type mice. data presented here demonstrate that tlr2 signaling is required for the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines: tnf-α, il-1β, il-6, il-12, ccl7, ccl8, ccl9, cxcl1, cxcl2, cxcl4, and cxcl5. cxcl9 and cxcl10 were also induced by hsv, but their production was not dependent upon tlr2 signaling. because tlr2−/− mice display significantly reduced mortality and diminished neuroinflammation in response to brain infection with hsv, the tlr2-dependent cytokines identified here might function as key players influencing viral neuropathogenesis.
biophysical mechanism of spike threshold dependence on the rate of rise of the membrane potential by sodium channel inactivation or subthreshold axonal potassium current the exact site of initiation and shape of action potentials vary among different neuronal types. the reason for this variability is largely unknown, but the subunit composition, density and distribution of voltage-gated sodium (nav) and potassium (kv) channels within the axon initial segment (ais) are likely to play a key role. here, we asked how heterogeneous are the density and distribution of nav and kv channels within the aiss of a variety of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. most of the studied cell types expressed a high density of nav1.6, kv1.1, and kv1.2 subunits in their ais, but the nav1.1 subunit could only be detected in gabaergic interneurons. a proximo-distal gradient in the density of these subunits was observed within the ais of certain nerve cells but not in others. for example, a gradual increase of the nav1.6 subunit was observed in cortical layer 2/3 and hippocampal ca1 pyramidal cell (pc) aiss, whereas its density was rather uniform in layer 5 pc aiss. the nav1.1 subunit was distributed evenly along the ais of short-axon cells of the main olfactory bulb but was restricted to the proximal part of the ais in cortical and cerebellar interneurons. our results reveal a cell type-dependent expression of sodium and potassium channel subunits with varying densities along the proximo-distal axis of the aiss. this precise arrangement is likely to contribute to the diversity of firing properties observed among central neurons.
development of cross-resistance by aspergillus fumigatus to clinical azoles following exposure to prochloraz, an agricultural azole aspergillus fumigatus, a ubiquitously distributed opportunistic pathogen, is the global leading cause of aspergillosis and causes one of the highest numbers of deaths among patients with fungal infections [1]. invasive aspergillosis is the most severe manifestation with an overall annual incidence up to 10% in immunosuppressed patients, whereas chronic pulmonary aspergillosis affects about 3 million, primarily immunocompetent, individuals each year [2]. three triazole antifungals, namely itraconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole, are recommended first-line drugs in the treatment and prophylaxis of aspergillosis [3]. however, azole resistance in a. fumigatus isolates is increasingly reported with variable prevalence in europe, the united states, south america, china, japan, iran, and india [4]–[9]. for example, about 10% of strains of a. fumigatus from the netherlands are itraconazole resistant, and in the united kingdom, the frequency increased from 0%–5% during 2002–2004 to 17%–20% in 2007–2009 [10]–[13]. in the artemis global surveillance program involving 62 medical centers, 5.8% of a. fumigatus strains showed elevated mics to one or more triazoles [5]. similarly, the prospective scare (surveillance collaboration on aspergillus resistance in europe) study involving 22 medical centers in 19 countries identified an overall prevalence of 3.4% azole resistance. azole-resistant a. fumigatus (araf) ranged from 0% to 26% among the 22 centres and was detected in 11 (57.9%) of the 19 participating european countries [4 and p.e. verweij, personal communication]. interestingly, almost half (48.9%) of the araf isolates from the scare network in european countries were resistant to multiple azoles and harbored the tr34/l98h mutation in the cyp51a gene [4 and p.e. verweij, personal communication]. indeed, multi-azole resistance in a. fumigatus due to the tr34/l98h mutations has become an emerging problem in both europe and asia and has been associated with high rates of treatment failures [12]–[14].    azole antifungal drugs inhibit the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway, specifically the cytochrome p450 sterol 14-α-demethylase encoded by the cyp51a gene, which leads to depletion of ergosterol and accumulation of toxic sterols. the majority of araf isolates contain alterations in the target enzyme and the mutated target showed reduced or no binding to the drugs [15]. while most mutations in araf isolates were single nucleotide substitutions in the target gene (cyp51a), mutations at other genes such as the cdr1b have also been reported. for example, in the united kingdom the frequency of araf isolates without cyp51a mutations has been reported to be more than 50% [16].
surfactant phospholipid dppc downregulates monocyte respiratory burst via modulation of pkc. thrombolysis is widely used to intervene in acute ischemic stroke, but reestablishment of circulation may paradoxically initiate a reperfusion injury. here we describe studies with mice lacking protein kinase cdelta (pkcdelta) showing that absence of this enzyme markedly reduces reperfusion injury following transient ischemia. this was associated with reduced infiltration of peripheral blood neutrophils into infarcted tissue and with impaired neutrophil adhesion, migration, respiratory burst, and degranulation in vitro. total body irradiation followed by transplantation with bone marrow from pkcdelta-null mice donors reduced infarct size and improved neurological outcome in wt mice, whereas marrow transplantation from wt donors increased infarction and worsened neurological scores in pkcdelta-null mice. these results indicate an important role for neutrophil pkcdelta in reperfusion injury and strongly suggest that pkcdelta inhibitors could prove useful in the treatment of stroke.
behavioral stability as an emergent process: toward a coherence theory of concentrated personal disadvantage this study used data from 6 sites and 3 countries to examine the developmental course of physical aggression in childhood and to analyze its linkage to violent and nonviolent offending outcomes in adolescence. the results indicate that among boys there is continuity in problem behavior from childhood to adolescence and that such continuity is especially acute when early problem behavior takes the form of physical aggression. chronic physical aggression during the elementary school years specifically increases the risk for continued physical violence as well as other nonviolent forms of delinquency during adolescence. however, this conclusion is reserved primarily for boys, because the results indicate no clear linkage between childhood physical aggression and adolescent offending among female samples despite notable similarities across male and female samples in the developmental course of physical aggression in childhood.
the role of udp-glucose:hydroxycinnamate glucosyltransferases in phenylpropanoid metabolism and the response to uv-b radiation in arabidopsis thaliana the three major flavonoids isolated from arabidopsis thaliana plants grown in the greenhouse were identified by means of spectroscopic analysis (uv, nmr, ms) and chiral capillary zone electrophoresis as the novel kaempferol 3-o-beta-[beta-d-glucopyranosyl(1-->6)d-glucopyranoside]-7-o-alpha-l- rhamnopyranoside (1), kaempferol 3-o-beta-d-glucopyranoside-7-o-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside (2), and kaempferol 3-o-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside-7-o-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside (3). comprehensive nmr studies including selective 1d and gradient-enhanced 2d techniques were applied in order to achieve full signal assignment and definitive proof of linkage for compound 1.
the role of interleukin-1β in human trophoblast motility interleukin-1 receptor type i, il-1 beta, il-1 receptor antagonist, and human macrophages were immunohistochemically localized in the villous trophoblast, maternal-trophoblast interphase, and maternal decidua during early human implantation. immunostaining for il-1 receptor type i was present in the syncytiotrophoblast and hyperplastic endometrial glands in the maternal decidua. immunoreactive il-1 beta was present in the villous cytotrophoblast, syncytiotrophoblast, intermediate trophoblast, and maternal stromal decidual cells. il-1 receptor antagonist staining was observed in the glandular endometrium of the maternal decidua and in isolated cells located inside the chorionic villi, intervillous space, and maternal decidua. mature human macrophages, as defined by both cd/68+ and ham56+, were present in the chorionic villi, maternal blood of intervillous space, and maternal decidua. co-localization studies demonstrated that macrophages in all of the reported locations also stained for immunoreactive il-1 beta. our results show the shared presence in maternal and embryonic tissues of this receptor-agonist-antagonist system during early human implantation. this finding supports an autocrine/paracrine role for the il-1 system in human implantation.
rosai-dorfman disease of the colon. sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy is a lymphoreticular disorder of obscure pathogenesis with extranodal lesions and a variable clinical course. clinical manifestations are most often in the head and neck, with 97% of patients showing cervical lymphadenopathy and a significant but lesser number having lesional infiltrates in the upper aerodigestive tracts, particularly the nasal cavity and salivary glands.
phosphatidylinositol‐phosphates mediate cytoskeletal reorganization during phagocytosis via a unique modular protein consisting of rhogef/dh and fyve domains in the parasitic protozoon entamoeba histolytica endocytosis is an important virulence function for entamoeba histolytica, the causative agent of amoebic dysentery. although a number of e. histolytica proteins that regulate this process have been identified, less is known about the role of lipids. in other systems, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (pi3p), a product of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi 3-kinase), has been shown to be required for endocytosis. fyve-finger domains are protein motifs that bind specifically to pi3p. using a pi3p biosensor consisting of glutathione-s-transferase (gst) fused to two tandem fyve-finger domains, we have localized pi3p to phagosomes but not fluid-phase pinosomes in e. histolytica, suggesting a role for pi3p in phagocytosis. treatment of cells with pi 3-kinase inhibitors impaired gst-2 x fyve-phagosome association supporting the authenticity of the biosensor staining. however, treatment with pi 3-kinase inhibitors did not inhibit e. histolytica-particle interaction, indicating that pi3p is not required for the initial step, but is required for subsequent steps of phagocytosis.
the use and role of predictive systems in disease management. twenty five years after its first enunciation, ipm is recognized as one of the most robust constructs to arise in the agricultural sciences during the second half of the twentieth century. the history of ipm, however, can be traced back to the late 1800s when ecology was identified as the foundation for scientific plant protection. that history, since the advent of modern organosynthetic pesticides, acquired elements of drama, intrigue, jealousy, and controversy that mark the path of many great scientific or technological achievements. evolution of ipm followed multiple paths in several countries and reached beyond the confines of entomological sciences. time and space constraints, however, bias this review toward entomology, among the plant protection sciences, and give it an obvious us slant, despite the global impact of ipm.
human leukocyte antigen class i alleles and haplotypes associated with primary hepatocellular carcinoma in persistent hbv-infected patients. the high prevalence of nasopharyngeal cancer (npc) in southern asia and mediterranean northern africa suggests genetic predisposition among other factors. while human leukocyte antigen (hla) haplotypes have been conclusively associated with npc predisposition in asians, northern african maghrebians have been less intensely studied. however, low resolution serological methods identified weak positive associations with hla-b5, b13 and b18 and a negative with hla-b14. using sequence based typing (sbt), we performed a direct comparison of hla class i frequencies in a cohort of 136 tunisian patients with npc matched for gender, age and geographical residence to 148 normal tunisians. the bimodal age distribution of npc in maghrebians was also taken into account. hla frequencies in normal tunisians were also compared with those of northern moroccan berbers (me) to evaluate whether the tunisian population in this study could be considered representative of other maghrebian populations. hla-b14 and -cw08 were negatively associated with npc (odd ratio = 0.09 and 0.18 respectively, fisher p2-value = 0.0001 and = 0.003). moreover, positive associations were observed for hla-b-18, -b51 (split of -b5) and -b57 (p2-value < 0.025 in all) confirming previous findings in maghrebs. the hla-b14/cw*08 haplotype frequency (hf) was 0.007 in npc patients compared to 0.057 in both tunisian (or = 0.12; p2-value = 0.001) and moroccan controls. this study confirms several previous associations noted by serologic typing between hla class i alleles and the prevalence of npc in maghrebians populations. in addition, we identified a putative haplotype rare in tunisian patients with npc that may serve as a genetic marker for further susceptibility studies.
the folding of a family of three-helix bundle proteins: spectrin r15 has a robust folding nucleus, unlike its homologous neighbours☆ energy landscape theory is a powerful tool for understanding the structure and dynamics of complex molecular systems, in particular biological macromolecules. the primary sequence of a protein defines its free-energy landscape and thus determines the folding pathway and the rate constants of folding and unfolding, as well as the protein’s native structure. theory has shown that roughness in the energy landscape will lead to slower folding, but derivation of detailed experimental descriptions of this landscape is challenging. simple folding models show that folding is significantly influenced by chain entropy; proteins in which the contacts are local fold quickly, owing to the low entropy cost of forming stabilizing, native contacts during folding. for some protein families, stability is also a determinant of folding rate constants. where these simple metrics fail to predict folding behaviour, it is probable that there are features in the energy landscape that are unusual. such general observations cannot explain the folding behaviour of the r15, r16 and r17 domains of α-spectrin. r15 folds ∼3,000 times faster than its homologues, although they have similar structures, stabilities and, as far as can be determined, transition-state stabilities. here we show that landscape roughness (internal friction) is responsible for the slower folding and unfolding of r16 and r17. we use chimaeric domains to demonstrate that this internal friction is a property of the core, and suggest that frustration in the landscape of the slow-folding spectrin domains may be due to misdocking of the long helices during folding. theoretical studies have suggested that rugged landscapes will result in slower folding; here we show experimentally that such a phenomenon directly influences the folding kinetics of a ‘normal’ protein, that is, one with a significant energy barrier that folds on a relatively slow, millisecond–second, timescale.
stoichiometry of animal manure and implications for nutrient cycling and agriculture in sub-saharan africa the effect of integrated farmyard manure (fym) and inorganic nitrogen (n) and phosphorous (p) fertilizers on growth, yield, and terminal moisture stress tolerance of rain-fed lowland rice was assessed in a field experiment carried out at fogera plains, in north-western ethiopia during the main cropping seasons of 2010 and 2011. treatments were factorial combinations of three rates of fym (0, 7.5, and 15 t ha), three rates of nitrogen (0, 60, 120 kg n ha) and three rates of phosphorus (0, 50, and 100 kg p2o5 ha). the experiment was laid out as a randomized complete block design replicated three times per treatment. data were collected on rice yield and yield components. leaf area index (lai), crop growth rate (cgr), net assimilation rate (nar) and harvest index (hi) were computed. economic analysis was also performed by estimating costs of alternative uses of fym and inorganic fertilizers as well as grain and straw prices. analysis of the results revealed that applying fym at 15 t ha combined with 120 kg n ha and 100 kg p2o5 ha increased grain yield by 123% and 38% compared to the negative (00-0 kg ha fym-n-p2o5) and positive (0-120-100 kg ha fym-n-p2o5) controls, respectively. similarly; lai, cgr, nar, the number of filled spikelets per panicle, n and p uptake,biomass yield, and grain protein content as well as agrophysiological efficiency of n and p were significantly enhanced in response to increasing the rates of fym and inorganic n and p fertilizers. it was observed that 15 t ha fym combined with 120 kg n ha and 100 kg p2o5 ha resulted in the maximum grain yield, grain protein content, and terminal moisture stress escape. though grain yield continued increasing significantly upto the highest combinations, results of the economic analysis showed that the maximum net benefit was obtained in response to the application of 7.5 t ha fym combined with 120 kg n ha and 100 kg p2o5 ha.
timing of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia predicts prognosis in metastatic colon cancer patients: a retrospective study in mfolfox6 -treated patients background chemotherapy induced neutropenia has been shown to be associated with improved treatment outcomes in selected solid tumours. we studied the association of chemotherapy induced neutropenia with treatment related outcomes in small cell lung cancer (sclc).   methods this is a retrospective analysis of patients receiving chemotherapy for sclc at the royal marsden hospital, uk over an 8 year period. the chemotherapy included carboplatin auc 5, iv and etoposide 100mg/m(2) iv on day 1 and 100mg/m(2) po, b.i.d. on day 2 and 3 every 21 days. patients were stratified into two groups (a) those experiencing grades 0-2 neutropenia and group (b) those experiencing grades 3-4 neutropenia. the outcomes studied were response rate, time to progression (ttp) and overall survival (os).   results 173 patients were studied. the median age 64 (range 39-83) and m/f ratio was 112:61. the response rates in groups a and b was 90% versus 90%, p=1.0. the median ttp in groups a and b was 30 and 38 weeks, p=0.05. the median os in groups a and b was 47 weeks versus 60 weeks, p=0.008. the differences in ttp and os were not significant in patients with extensive stage disease.   conclusions occurrence of chemotherapy induced grade 3 or 4 neutropenia correlated with os in patients with sclc receiving carboplatin and etoposide chemotherapy. trials exploring controlled, safe intra-patient dose escalation with the intent of achieving grade 3 or 4 neutropenia in patients with sclc are warranted.
solvent effect on hemin-catalyzed polymerization of phenols horseradish peroxidase (hrp) is a commercially important enzyme that is available from a number of supply houses in a variety of grades of purity and isoenzymic combinations. the present article describes a comparative study made on nine hrp preparations. six of these samples were predominantly composed of basic hrp, pl 8.5, and three of acidic hrp, pl 3.5. two of the basic preparations were of lower purity than the others. the apparent molar catalytic activity of basic hrp with 0.5 mmabts and 0.2 mm h2o2 was around 950 s−1 (about 770 s−1 for the less pure samples) and with a 5 mm guaiacol and 0.6 mm h2o2 was about 180 s−1 for all the samples. a similar value (approximately 1000 s−1) was observed for acidic hrp but only at higher concentrations of abts (20 mm). with 20 mm guaiacol the molar catalytic activity of the acid isoenzyme was 65 s−1. the apparent km for abts of the acidic isoenzyme was 4 mm whereas for the basic isoenzyme it was 0.1 mm. all the enzymes were inactivated by h2o2 when it was supplied as the only substrate. under these conditions the partition ratio (r = number of catalytic cycles given by the enzyme before its inactivation), apparent dissociation constant (kl), and apparent rate constant of inactivation (kinact) were about twice as large for the acidic samples (1350, 2.6 mm, 9 · 10−3 s−1) as for the basic (650, 1.3 mm, 5 · 10−3 s−1). the apparent catalytic constant (kcat) was 3–4 times larger, and the efficiency of catalysis (kcat/kl) was double for the acidic isoenzyme, but the efficiency of inactivation (kinact/kl) was similar. the data obtained provide useful information for those using hrp isoenzymes for biotechnological applications (e.g., biosensors, bioreactors, or assays). © 1996 john wiley & sons, inc.
histological finding of atypical subtrochanteric fracture after long-term alendronate therapy reports linking long‐term use of bisphosphonates (bps) with atypical fractures of the femur led the leadership of the american society for bone and mineral research (asbmr) to appoint a task force to address key questions related to this problem. a multidisciplinary expert group reviewed pertinent published reports concerning atypical femur fractures, as well as preclinical studies that could provide insight into their pathogenesis. a case definition was developed so that subsequent studies report on the same condition. the task force defined major and minor features of complete and incomplete atypical femoral fractures and recommends that all major features, including their location in the subtrochanteric region and femoral shaft, transverse or short oblique orientation, minimal or no associated trauma, a medial spike when the fracture is complete, and absence of comminution, be present to designate a femoral fracture as atypical. minor features include their association with cortical thickening, a periosteal reaction of the lateral cortex, prodromal pain, bilaterality, delayed healing, comorbid conditions, and concomitant drug exposures, including bps, other antiresorptive agents, glucocorticoids, and proton pump inhibitors. preclinical data evaluating the effects of bps on collagen cross‐linking and maturation, accumulation of microdamage and advanced glycation end products, mineralization, remodeling, vascularity, and angiogenesis lend biologic plausibility to a potential association with long‐term bp use. based on published and unpublished data and the widespread use of bps, the incidence of atypical femoral fractures associated with bp therapy for osteoporosis appears to be very low, particularly compared with the number of vertebral, hip, and other fractures that are prevented by bps. moreover, a causal association between bps and atypical fractures has not been established. however, recent observations suggest that the risk rises with increasing duration of exposure, and there is concern that lack of awareness and underreporting may mask the true incidence of the problem. given the relative rarity of atypical femoral fractures, the task force recommends that specific diagnostic and procedural codes be created and that an international registry be established to facilitate studies of the clinical and genetic risk factors and optimal surgical and medical management of these fractures. physicians and patients should be made aware of the possibility of atypical femoral fractures and of the potential for bilaterality through a change in labeling of bps. research directions should include development of animal models, increased surveillance, and additional epidemiologic and clinical data to establish the true incidence of and risk factors for this condition and to inform orthopedic and medical management. © 2010 american society for bone and mineral research.
nbce1 (slc4a4) a potential ph regulator in enamel organ cells during enamel development in the mouse mature enamel consists of densely packed and highly organized large hydroxyapatite crystals. the molecular machinery responsible for the formation of fully matured enamel is poorly described but appears to involve oscillative ph changes at the enamel surface. we conducted an immunohistochemical investigation of selected transporters and related proteins in the multilayered rat incisor enamel organ. connexin 43 (cx-43) is found in papillary cells and ameloblasts, whereas na(+)-k(+)-atpase is heavily expressed during maturation in the papillary cell layer only. given the distribution of cx-43 channels and na(+)-k(+)-atpase, we suggest that ameloblasts and the papillary cell layer act as a functional syncytium. during enamel maturation ameloblasts undergo repetitive cycles of modulation between ruffle-ended (ra) and smooth-ended (sa) ameloblast morphologies. carbonic anhydrase ii and vacuolar h(+)-atpase are expressed simultaneously at the beginning of the maturation stage in ra cells. the proton pumps are present in the ruffled border of ra and appear to be internalized during the sa stage. both papillary cells and ameloblasts express plasma membrane acid/base transporters (ae2, nbc, and nhe1). ae2 and nhe1 change position relative to the enamel surface as localization of the tight junctions changes during ameloblast modulation cycles. we suggest that the concerted action of the papillary cell layer and the modulating ameloblasts regulates the enamel microenvironment, resulting in oscillating ph fluctuations. the ph fluctuations at the enamel surface may be required to keep intercrystalline spaces open in the surface layers of the enamel, enabling degraded enamel matrix proteins to be removed while hydroxyapatite crystals grow as a result of influx of calcium and phosphate ions.
restoration of hypothalamic signaling systems as a cause of improved metabolic parameters in rats with neonatal diabetes model during treatment with bromocriptine mesylate bromocriptine, a dopamine d2 agonist, inhibits seasonal fattening and improves seasonal insulin resistance in syrian hamsters. alterations in daily rhythms of neuroendocrine activities are involved in the regulation of seasonal metabolic changes. changes in circadian neuroendocrine activities that regulate metabolism are believed to be modulated by central circadian oscillators within the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (scn) of seasonal animals. we examined the association of metabolic responses to bromocriptine with its effects on the daily rhythms of metabolic hormones and daily monoamine profiles within the scn, a primary circadian pacemaker known to regulate metabolism, in syrian hamsters. obese glucose-intolerant male syrian hamsters (body weight [bw] 185 ± 10 g) held on 14h daily photoperiods were treated at light onset with bromocriptine (800 μg/animal/day, ip) or vehicle for 2 weeks. animals were then subjected to a glucose tolerance test (gtt) (3 g/kg bw, ip). different subsets of animals (n = 6) from each treatment group were sacrificed at 0h/24h, 5h, 10h, 15h, or 20h after light onset for analyses of scn monoamines, plasma insulin, prolactin, cortisol, thyroxin (t4), triiodothyronine (t3), glucose, and free fatty acids (ffas). compared with control values, bromocriptine treatment significantly reduced weight gain (14.9 vs. −2.9 g, p <. 01) and the areas under the gtt glucose and insulin curves by 29% and 48%, respectively (p <. 05). basal plasma insulin concentration was markedly reduced throughout the day in bromocriptine-treated animals without influencing plasma glucose levels. bromocriptine reduced the daily peak in ffa by 26% during the late light span(p <. 05). bromocriptine significantly shifted the daily plasma cortisol peak from the early dark to the light period of the day, reduced the plasma prolactin (mean 1.8 vs. 39.4 ng/dl) and t4 throughout the day (mean 1.6 vs. 3.8 μg/dl), and selectively reduced t3 during the dark period of the day (p <. 01). concurrently, bromocriptine treatment significantly reduced scn dopamine turnover during the light period and shifted daily peaks of scn serotonin and 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid (5-hiaa) content by 12h from the light to the dark period of the day (p <. 05). this was confirmed by a further in vivo microdialysis study in which bromocriptine increased scn extracellular 5-hiaa of glucose-intolerant hamsters during the dark phase (47% increase, p <. 05) toward levels observed in normal glucose-tolerant hamsters. thus, bromocriptine-induced resetting of daily patterns of scn neurotransmitter metabolism is associated with the effects of bromocriptine on attenuation of the obese insulin-resistant and glucose-intolerant condition. a large body of corroborating evidence suggests that such bromocriptine-induced changes in scn monoamine metabolism may be functional in its effects on metabolism.

sinomenine hydrochloride inhibits the metastasis of human glioblastoma cells by suppressing the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2/-9 and reversing the endogenous and exogenous epithelial-mesenchymal transition processing bodies (p-bodies) are ribonucleoprotein complexes involved in post-transcriptional mrna metabolism that accumulate in cells exposed to various stress stimuli. the treatment of mammary epithelial cells with transforming growth factor-beta (tgf-β), triggers epithelial-mesenchymal transition (emt), and induces the formation of p-bodies. ectopic expression of the transcription factor twist, which stimulates emt downstream of the tgf-β receptor, also promotes p-body formation. removal of tgf-β from treated cells results in the clearance of p-bodies by a process that is blocked by inhibitors of autophagy. activators of autophagy enhance p-body clearance and block emt. blockage of p-body formation by disruption of the gene for ddx6, a protein essential for p-body assembly, blocks emt and prevents tumor cell metastasis in vivo. these studies suggest critical roles for p-body formation and autophagy in transitions of cancer cells between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes and help explain how autophagy functions to promote or suppress tumor cell growth during different stages of tumorigenesis.
μ-opioid receptors: correlation of agonist efficacy for signalling with ability to activate internalization we investigated the ability of the activated μ‐opioid receptor (mor) to differentiate between myristoylated gαi1 and gαoa type g proteins, and the maximal activity of a range of synthetic and endogenous agonists to activate each g protein. membranes from hek293 cells stably expressing transfected mor were chaotrope extracted to denature endogenous g‐proteins and reconstituted with specific purified g‐proteins. the g subunits were generated in bacteria and were demonstrated to be recognised equivalently to bovine brain purified g protein by cb1 cannabinoid receptors. the ability of agonists to catalyse the mor‐dependent gdp/[35s]gtps exchange was then compared for gαi1 and gαoa. activation of mor by damgo produced a high‐affinity saturable interaction for gαoa (km=20±1 nm) but a low‐affinity interaction with gαi1 (km=116±12 nm). damgo, met‐enkephalin and leucine‐enkephalin displayed maximal g activation among the agonists evaluated. endomorphins 1 and 2, methadone and β‐endorphin activated both g to more than 75% of the maximal response, whereas fentanyl partially activated both g‐proteins. buprenorphine and morphine demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the maximal activities between gαi1 and gαoa. interestingly, damgo, morphine, endomorphins 1 and 2, displayed significant differences in the potencies for the activation of the two g. differences in maximal activity and potency, for gαi1 versus gαoa, are both indicative of agonist selective activation of g‐proteins in response to mor activation. these findings may provide a starting point for the design of drugs that demonstrate greater selectivity between these two g‐proteins and therefore produce a more limited range of effects.
feasibility and diagnostic performance of dual-tracer-guided sentinel lymph node biopsy in ct1-2n0m0 gastric cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic studies purpose complicated gastric lymphatic drainage potentially undermines the utility of sentinel node (sn) biopsy in patients with gastric cancer. encouraged by several favorable single-institution reports, we conducted a multicenter, single-arm, phase ii study of sn mapping that used a standardized dual tracer endoscopic injection technique.   patients and methods patients with previously untreated ct1 or ct2 gastric adenocarcinomas < 4 cm in gross diameter were eligible for inclusion in this study. sn mapping was performed by using a standardized dual tracer endoscopic injection technique. following biopsy of the identified sns, mandatory comprehensive d2 or modified d2 gastrectomy was performed according to current japanese gastric cancer association guidelines.   results among 433 patients who gave preoperative consent, 397 were deemed eligible on the basis of surgical findings. sn biopsy was performed in all patients, and the sn detection rate was 97.5% (387 of 397). of 57 patients with lymph node metastasis by conventional hematoxylin and eosin staining, 93% (53 of 57) had positive sns, and the accuracy of nodal evaluation for metastasis was 99% (383 of 387). only four false-negative sn biopsies were observed, and pathologic analysis revealed that three of those biopsies were pt2 or tumors > 4 cm. we observed no serious adverse effects related to endoscopic tracer injection or the sn mapping procedure.   conclusion the endoscopic dual tracer method for sn biopsy was confirmed as safe and effective when applied to the superficial, relatively small gastric adenocarcinomas included in this study.
the sugarless mutation affects the expression of the white eye color gene in drosophila melanogaster in vitro experiments suggest that glycosaminoglycans (gags) and the proteins to which they are attached (proteoglycans) are important for modulating growth factor signaling. however, in vivo evidence to support this view has been lacking, in part because mutations that disrupt the production of gag polymers and the core proteins have not been available. here we describe the identification and characterization of drosophila mutants in the suppenkasper (ska) gene. the ska gene encodes udp-glucose dehydrogenase which produces glucuronic acid, an essential component for the synthesis of heparan and chondroitin sulfate. ska mutants fail to put heparan side chains on proteoglycans such as syndecan. surprisingly, mutant embryos produced by germ-line clones of this general metabolic gene exhibit embryonic cuticle phenotypes strikingly similar to those that result from loss-of-function mutations in genes of the wingless (wg) signaling pathway. zygotic loss of ska leads to reduced growth of imaginal discs and pattern defects similar to wg mutants. in addition, genetic interactions of ska with wg and dishevelled mutants are observed. these data demonstrate the importance of proteoglycans and gags in wg signaling in vivo and suggest that wnt-like growth factors may be particularly sensitive to perturbations of gag biosynthesis.
aflatoxin b1 and m1 degradation by lac2 from pleurotus pulmonarius and redox mediators aflatoxins are cancerogenic compounds produced predominantly by certain strains of the aspergillus genus. the ideal solution for minimization of health risk that aflatoxins pose is the prevention of foods and feeds contamination. unfortunately, these contaminants can never be completely removed, and on that account, many studies have been carried out to explore an effective process of their detoxification to a threshold level. biological decontamination seems to be attractive because it works under mild, environmentally friendly conditions. this review is focused on the biological detoxification of aflatoxins, especially aflatoxin b1, by microorganisms. there are briefly mentioned aflatoxin metabolic pathways in the human and animal body. microorganisms such as soil or water bacteria, fungi, and protozoa and specific enzymes isolated from microbial systems can degrade aflatoxin group members with varied efficiency to less- or nontoxic products. some aflatoxin-producing fungi from aspergillus species have the capability to degrade their own synthesized mycotoxins. yeasts and lactic acid bacteria work as biological adsorbents that prevent aflatoxin’s transfer to the intestinal tract of humans and animals. aflatoxin b1 absorbed into the organism could be metabolized by significantly different pathways. they lead to the production of the relatively nontoxic compounds, on the one hand, or to highly toxic active forms on the other hand.
interactions between torulaspora delbrueckii and saccharomyces cerevisiae in wine fermentation: influence of inoculation and nitrogen content hanseniaspora guilliermondii and hanseniaspora uvarum were tested in grape must fermentations as pure and mixed starter cultures with saccharomyces cerevisiae. in pure cultures, the specific growth rates found were 0.29 h(-1) for h. uvarum, 0.23 h(-1) for h. guilliermondii and 0.18 h(-1) for s. cerevisiae. no significant differences were observed between these values and those obtained in mixed cultures. results presented in this work show that growth of apiculate yeasts during the first days of fermentation enhances the production of desirable compounds, such as esters, and may not have a negative influence on the production of higher alcohols and undesirable heavy sulphur compounds. growth of apiculate yeasts reduced the total content of higher alcohols in wines, when compared to those produced by a pure culture of s. cerevisiae. furthermore, the highest levels of 2-phenylethyl acetate were obtained when h. guilliermondii was inoculated in grape musts, whereas h. uvarum increased the isoamyl acetate content of wines. apiculate yeasts produced high amounts of ethyl acetate; however, the level of this compound decreased in mixed cultures of apiculate yeasts and s. cerevisiae. when s. cerevisiae was used as a starter culture, wines showed higher concentrations of glycerol, 2-phenylethanol and ethyl hexanoate. in mixed cultures of apiculate yeasts and s. cerevisiae, wines presented amounts of methionol, acetic acid-3-(methylthio)propyl ester, 4-(methylthio)-1-butanol, 2-mercaptoethanol and cis-2-methyltetrahydro-thiophen-3-ol similar to those produced by a pure culture of s. cerevisiae. an increase in the amounts of 3-(ethylthio)-1-propanol, trans-2-methyltetrahydro-thiophen-3-ol and 3-mercapto-1-propanol was obtained in wines produced from mixed cultures with h. guilliermondii.
antimicrobial resistance, virulence profiles and molecular subtypes of salmonella enterica serovars typhi and paratyphi a blood isolates from kolkata, india during 2009-2013 abstract the prevalence of salmonella enterica serotype paratyphi a infection is increasing, and multidrug resistance is a well-recognized problem. resistance to fluoroquinolones is common and leads to more frequent use of newer agents like azithromycin. we report the first case of azithromycin resistance and treatment failure in a patient with s. paratyphi a infection.
quantitative fret imaging to visualize the invasiveness of live breast cancer cells matrix metalloproteinases (mmps), a family of zinc-binding endopeptidases, play important roles in cancer proliferation and dissemination, and may be further associated with other diseases. in particular, membrane-type mmps (mt-mmps) are crucial for cancer cell invasion. in this report, we summarize the current views on the role of mt-mmps in cancer dissemination. the regulated and restricted degradation of the extracellular matrix (ecm) surrounding the tumor surface is a trigger event for cell protrusion and invasion. this is thought to be primarily organized by mt-mmps, since a shift in balance between cell adhesion molecules, ecm and proteolysis at the focal cell surface may result in conditions especially suitable for cancer cells to progress and invade the ecm. to resolve the physiological mechanisms of cancer invasion and migration, molecular milieu surrounding the mt-mmps expressed on tumor cell surfaces should be further examined for each cell type, which may consequently provide a novel clinical tool to regulate cancer behavior.
knat2: evidence for a link between knotted-like genes and carpel development. the first step in flower development is the generation of a floral meristem by the inflorescence meristem. we have analyzed how this process is affected by mutant alleles of the arabidopsis gene leafy. we show that leafy interacts with another floral control gene, apetala1, to promote the transition from inflorescence to floral meristem. we have cloned the leafy gene, and, consistent with the mutant phenotype, we find that leafy rna is expressed strongly in young flower primordia. leafy expression procedes expression of the homeotic genes agamous and apetala3, which specify organ identify within the flower. furthermore, we demonstrate that leafy is the arabidopsis homolog of the floricaula gene, which controls floral meristem identity in the distantly related species antirrhinum majus.
stn1 is critical for telomere maintenance and long-term viability of somatic human cells the proper maintenance of telomeres is essential for genome stability. mammalian telomere maintenance is governed by a number of telomere binding proteins, including the newly identified ctc1–stn1–ten1 (cst) complex. however, the in vivo functions of mammalian cst remain unclear. to address this question, we conditionally deleted ctc1 from mice. we report here that ctc1 null mice experience rapid onset of global cellular proliferative defects and die prematurely from complete bone marrow failure due to the activation of an atr‐dependent g2/m checkpoint. acute deletion of ctc1 does not result in telomere deprotection, suggesting that mammalian cst is not involved in capping telomeres. rather, ctc1 facilitates telomere replication by promoting efficient restart of stalled replication forks. ctc1 deletion results in increased loss of leading c‐strand telomeres, catastrophic telomere loss and accumulation of excessive ss telomere dna. our data demonstrate an essential role for ctc1 in promoting efficient replication and length maintenance of telomeres.
the heparan sulfate proteoglycan agrin contributes to barrier properties of mouse brain endothelial cells by stabilizing adherens junctions important insights into the molecular mechanism of t cell extravasation across the blood–brain barrier (bbb) have already been obtained using immortalized mouse brain endothelioma cell lines (bend). however, compared with bend, primary brain endothelial cells have been shown to establish better barrier characteristics, including complex tight junctions and low permeability. in this study, we asked whether bend5 and primary mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells (pmbmecs) were equally suited as in vitro models with which to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms of t cell extravasation across the bbb. we found that both in vitro bbb models equally supported both t cell adhesion under static and physiologic flow conditions, and t cell crawling on the endothelial surface against the direction of flow. in contrast, distances of t cell crawling on pmbmecs were strikingly longer than on bend5, whereas diapedesis of t cells across pmbmecs was dramatically reduced compared with bend5. thus, both in vitro bbb models are suited to study t cell adhesion. however, because pmbmecs better reflect endothelial bbb specialization in vivo, we propose that more reliable information about the cellular and molecular mechanisms of t cell diapedesis across the bbb can be attained using pmbmecs.
antiapoptotic effects of the peptidergic drug cerebrolysin on primary cultures of embryonic chick cortical neurons glutamate induced neurotoxicity has been proposed to account for the loss of neurons after ischemia as well as in the cause of neurodegenerative diseases. we have studied the effects of exogenous glutamate on survival of neurons from chick embryo telencephalon, precultured with a peptide derivative for 8 days. the peptide derivative cerebrolysin is a drug produced by standardised enzymatic breakdown consisting of 80% peptides and 20% amino acids. toxic effects of acute glutamate exposure were prevented by cerebrolysin in a concentration-dependent manner. 20 and 40 microliters cerebrolysin produce distinct neuroprotective effects. however, 80 microliters cerebrolysin/ml nutrition medium more than doubles neuronal viability compared to untreated control cells. these concentration-dependent effects of cerebrolysin were evident even at the light microscopic level.
identification of residues in the bst-2 tm domain important for antagonism by hiv-1 vpu using a gain-of-function approach backgroundthe human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) vpu protein enhances virus release from infected cells and induces proteasomal degradation of cd4. recent work identified bst-2/cd317 as a host factor that inhibits hiv-1 virus release in a vpu sensitive manner. a current working model proposes that bst-2 inhibits virus release by tethering viral particles to the cell surface thereby triggering their subsequent endocytosis.resultshere we defined structural properties of bst-2 required for inhibition of virus release and for sensitivity to vpu. we found that bst-2 is modified by n-linked glycosylation at two sites in the extracellular domain. however, n-linked glycosylation was not important for inhibition of hiv-1 virus release nor did it affect surface expression or sensitivity to vpu. rodent bst-2 was previously found to form cysteine-linked dimers. analysis of single, double, or triple cysteine mutants revealed that any one of three cysteine residues present in the bst-2 extracellular domain was sufficient for bst-2 dimerization, for inhibition of virus release, and sensitivity to vpu. in contrast, bst-2 lacking all three cysteines in its ectodomain was unable to inhibit release of wild type or vpu-deficient hiv-1 virions. this defect was not caused by a gross defect in bst-2 trafficking as the mutant protein was expressed at the cell surface of transfected 293t cells and was down-modulated by vpu similar to wild type bst-2.conclusionwhile bst-2 glycosylation was functionally irrelevant, formation of cysteine-linked dimers appeared to be important for inhibition of virus release. however lack of dimerization did not prevent surface expression or vpu sensitivity of bst-2, suggesting vpu sensitivity and inhibition of virus release are separable properties of bst-2.
does the menstrual cycle influence the motor and phosphene thresholds in migraine? objective: to determine whether there are menstrual cycle–related effects on cortical excitability in normal women. background: ovarian steroid hormones affect neurotransmission in the brain. data from animal experiments have shown that progesterone metabolites enhance the action of gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the cortex, producing benzodiazepine-like (e.g., diazepam and lorazepam) physiologic and behavioral effects. estradiol has excitatory effects on measures of neuronal excitability, possibly acting through the glutamate system. these effects have been difficult to detect in women using conventional techniques. however, recently, paired transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms) has been used to detect the effects of gabaergic and glutamatergic drugs in humans. we used this method to measure the effects of the menstrual cycle in normal women. methods: we tested 13 healthy women during the follicular (low-progesterone) and luteal (high-progesterone) phases of the menstrual cycle using paired tms. the effect of a subthreshold conditioning pulse on the cortex was tested by measuring the response to a second suprathreshold test pulse and comparing it with the response elicited by the test pulse administered alone. results: conditioning tms produced more inhibition in the luteal phase than in the follicular phase (p = 0.01), of similar magnitude to the reported effect of benzodiazepine drugs. conclusions: this study provides the first direct evidence of changes in the excitability of a cortical network with the menstrual cycle. the results also show a potential confound for studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation in populations that include menstruating women.
nadph oxidase-2 does not contribute to β-cell glucotoxicity in cultured pancreatic islets from c57bl/6j mice aim/hypothesis rat pancreatic islet cell apoptosis is minimal after prolonged culture in 10 mmol/l glucose (g10), largely increased in 5 mmol/l glucose (g5) and moderately increased in 30 mmol/l glucose (g30). this glucose-dependent asymmetric v-shaped profile is preceded by parallel changes in the mrna levels of oxidative stress-response genes like metallothionein 1a (mt1a). in this study, we tested the effect of zncl2, a potent inducer of mt1a, on apoptosis, mitochondrial oxidative stress and alterations of glucose-induced insulin secretion (gsis) induced by prolonged exposure to low and high vs. intermediate glucose concentrations. methods male wistar rat islets were cultured in rpmi medium. islet gene mrna levels were measured by rtq-pcr. apoptosis was quantified by measuring islet cytosolic histone-associated dna fragments and the percentage of tunel-positive β-cells. mitochondrial thiol oxidation was measured in rat islet cell clusters expressing “redox sensitive gfp” targeted to the mitochondria (mt-rogfp1). insulin secretion was measured by ria. results as observed for mt1a mrna levels, β-cell apoptosis and loss of gsis, culture in either g5 or g30 vs. g10 significantly increased mt-rogfp1 oxidation. while tpen decreased mt1a/2a mrna induction by g5, addition of 50–100 µm zncl2 to the culture medium strongly increased mt1a/2a mrna and protein levels, reduced early mt-rogfp oxidation and significantly decreased late β-cell apoptosis after prolonged culture in g5 or g30 vs. g10. it did not, however, prevent the loss of gsis under these culture conditions. conclusion zncl2 reduces mitochondrial oxidative stress and improves rat β-cell survival during culture in the presence of low and high vs. intermediate glucose concentrations without improving their acute gsis.
diabetes in the elderly. a unique set of management challenges. abstract a 46-yr-old hypertensive man treated for 1 yr with apresoline 200 mg and propranolol 240 mg daily, was admitted in deep coma, severely dehydrated, serum glucose 1130 mg100 ml without ketonemia, normal serum co 2 , blood ph 7.52, serum osmolarity 357 mosm/kg, fever of 105.6°f, and central venous pressure of less than 1 cm. the plasma free fatty acid was 270 μeg/liter, insulin 16 μu/ml and growth hormone 2.5 ng/ml. he responded excellently to 100 units regular insulin and 8 liters of hypotonic infusions. seven months later he had a similar episode despite addition of 1 g tolbutamide daily in the interim. when studied without any medication he had fasting hyperglycemia of 175–200 mg100 ml. an intravenous tolbutamide test was diabetic. when repeated following intravenous propranolol, 10 mg, the insulin response to tolbutamide was diminished. without propranolol or hypoglycemic therapy, fasting hyperglycemia increased over 5–6 wk to 630 mg100 ml, with traces of ketonemia, ffa level of 1350 μeq/liter and serum osmolarity of 305 mosm/kg. the study was later repeated with the addition of oral propranolol 240 mg daily. uncontrolled diabetes was again clinically manifest, although glucose levels rose more slowly. despite fasting glucose levels reaching 930 mg100 ml, no sign of ketosis occurred when the patient was taking propranolol. ffa level at this time was only 640 μeq/liter and serum osmolarity had risen to 335 mosm/kg. his diabetes is now satisfactorily treated with insulin injections, to avoid the disturbances of carbohydrate metabolism caused by propranolol. these studies indicate that large amounts of propranolol may precipitate hyperosmolar nonketotic coma in an untreated diabetic by a blockade of lipolysis and/or impairment of insulin response.
comparison of compression algorithms' impact on iris recognition accuracy ii: revisiting jpeg the resilience of identity verification systems to subsampling and compression of human iris images is investigated for three high performance iris matching algorithms. for evaluation, 2156 images from 308 eyes are mapped into a rectangular format with 512 pixels circumferentially and 80 radially. for identity verification, the 48 rows nearest the pupil were taken and the images were subsampled by fourier domain processing. negligible degradation in verification is observed if at least 171 circumferential and 16 radial fourier coefficients are preserved, corresponding to sampling at 342 by 32 pixels. with compression by jpeg 2000, improved performance is observed down to 0.3 bpp, attributed to noise reduction without significant loss of texture. to ensure that no algorithm is degraded, it is recommended that normalized iris images should be exchanged at 512 times 80 pixel resolution, compressed by jpeg 2000 to 0.5 bpp. this achieves a smaller file size than the proposed m1 biometric data interchange format
first de novo kcnd3 mutation causes severe kv4.3 channel dysfunction leading to early onset cerebellar ataxia, intellectual disability, oral apraxia and epilepsy to identify the causative gene for the neurodegenerative disorder spinocerebellar ataxia type 19 (sca19) located on chromosomal region 1p21‐q21.
year : 2004 the hypoxia-induced paralogs scylla and charybdis inhibit growth by down-regulating s 6 k activity upstream of tsc in drosophila the inherited human disease tuberous sclerosis, characterized by hamartomatous tumors, results from mutations in either tsc1 or tsc2. we have characterized mutations in the drosophila tsc1 and tsc2/gigas genes. inactivating mutations in either gene cause an identical phenotype characterized by enhanced growth and increased cell size with no change in ploidy. overall, mutant cells spend less time in g1. coexpression of both tsc1 and tsc2 restricts tissue growth and reduces cell size and cell proliferation. this phenotype is modulated by manipulations in cyclin levels. in postmitotic mutant cells, levels of cyclin e and cyclin a are elevated. this correlates with a tendency for these cells to reenter the cell cycle inappropriately as is observed in the human lesions.
sumoylation is required for glycine-induced increases in ampa receptor surface expression (chemltp) in hippocampal neurons induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation (ltp) requires activation of ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii (camkii), whereas maintenance of ltp additionally requires protein synthesis. we recently reported that camkii stimulates protein synthesis in depolarized hippocampal neurons through phosphorylation of the mrna translation factor cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein (cpeb), and this phosphorylation is rapidly reversed by protein phosphatase 1 (pp1). protein synthesis-dependent late-phase ltp (l-ltp) in the hippocampus requires calcium influx through the nmda-type glutamate receptor (nmda-r) to activate camkii as well as concomitant inhibition of pp1 mediated by protein kinase a. therefore, we investigated the regulation of cpeb phosphorylation during l-ltp. pharmacological stimulation of the nmda-r in hippocampal slices to produce chemical long-term depression induced a brief dephosphorylation of cpeb. modest ltp induction (once at 100 hz), which induces a protein synthesis-independent early-phase ltp (e-ltp), resulted in a transient phosphorylation of cpeb. however, stronger stimulation (four times at 100 hz), known to induce protein synthesis-dependent l-ltp, elicited a prolonged phosphorylation of cpeb. furthermore, cpeb phosphorylation correlated with phosphorylation of pp1 inhibitor dopamine- and camp-regulated phosphoprotein, a known substrate for protein kinase a. these results evoke the hypothesis that bidirectional regulation of cpeb phosphorylation by camkii and protein phosphatases may serve as a mechanism to convert e-ltp into protein synthesis-dependent l-ltp by stimulating protein synthesis and thereby stabilizing synaptic enhancement.
transcriptome characterization by rna sequencing identifies a major molecular and clinical subdivision in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. noncoding rnas transcribed from dna repeats in heterochromatin are expressed at surprisingly high levels in tumors. satellite repeats in heterochromatin are transcribed into noncoding rnas that have been linked to gene silencing and maintenance of chromosomal integrity. using digital gene expression analysis, we showed that these transcripts are greatly overexpressed in mouse and human epithelial cancers. in 8 of 10 mouse pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (pdacs), pericentromeric satellites accounted for a mean 12% (range 1 to 50%) of all cellular transcripts, a mean 40-fold increase over that in normal tissue. in 15 of 15 human pdacs, alpha satellite transcripts were most abundant and hsatii transcripts were highly specific for cancer. similar patterns were observed in cancers of the lung, kidney, ovary, colon, and prostate. derepression of satellite transcripts correlated with overexpression of the long interspersed nuclear element 1 (line-1) retrotransposon and with aberrant expression of neuroendocrine-associated genes proximal to line-1 insertions. the overexpression of satellite transcripts in cancer may reflect global alterations in heterochromatin silencing and could potentially be useful as a biomarker for cancer detection.
differential regulation of disheveled in a novel vegetal cortical domain in sea urchin eggs and embryos: implications for the localized activation of canonical wnt signaling the dishevelled protein regulates many developmental processes in animals ranging from hydra to humans. here, we discuss the various known signaling activities of this enigmatic protein and focus on the biological processes that dishevelled controls. through its many signaling activities, dishevelled plays important roles in the embryo and the adult, ranging from cell-fate specification and cell polarity to social behavior. dishevelled also has important roles in the governance of polarized cell divisions, in the directed migration of individual cells, and in cardiac development and neuronal structure and function.
ion channels in nociceptors painful peripheral neuropathy often occurs without apparent underlying cause. gain-of-function variants of sodium channel nav1.7 have recently been found in ∼30% of cases of idiopathic painful small-fiber neuropathy. here, we describe mutations in nav1.8, another sodium channel that is specifically expressed in dorsal root ganglion (drg) neurons and peripheral nerve axons, in patients with painful neuropathy. seven nav1.8 mutations were identified in 9 subjects within a series of 104 patients with painful predominantly small-fiber neuropathy. three mutations met criteria for potential pathogenicity based on predictive algorithms and were assessed by voltage and current clamp. functional profiling showed that two of these three nav1.8 mutations enhance the channel’s response to depolarization and produce hyperexcitability in drg neurons. these observations suggest that mutations of nav1.8 contribute to painful peripheral neuropathy.
preoperative low tri-iodothyronine concentration is associated with worse health status and shorter five year survival of primary brain tumor patients this study aims to evaluate the incidence of non-thyroid illness syndrome (ntis) among patients diagnosed as lung cancer and its association with the stage of the disease, eastern cooperative oncology group (ecog) performance score, nutritional parameters, and survival. we enrolled 120 patients that 71 of them with newly diagnosed and staged non-small cell lung cancer and 49 of them small-cell lung cancer. the cases were examined for thyroid function tests, ecog performance score, and nutritional evaluation before treatment. also, cases were evaluated for their overall survival rates. ntis was identified in 30 (42 %) of the 71 non-small cell lung cancer patients and 22 (44 %) of the 49 small-cell lung cancer patients. ntis was more frequent among advanced stage of cases. serum albumin level, cholesterol level, lymphocyte level, and body mass index were detected to be significantly low and ecog performance score was significantly high in cases with ntis when compared to cases without ntis. ntis was found to be negatively correlated with body mass index, ecog performance score, and serum albumin level, and it was positively correlated with disease stage. ntis was detected significantly as a poor prognostic factor for lung cancer. ntis was frequently seen in cases with non-small cell lung cancer and small-cell lung cancer. ntis can be used as a predictor of poor prognosis for lung cancer patients.
halide dependence of the halorhodopsin photocycle as measured by time-resolved infrared spectra. abstract— step‐scan fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with 50 ns time resolution was applied to the early stages of the photocycle of halorhodopsin (hr) for the temperature range 3‐42° c. kinetic data analysis with global fitting revealed two distinct kinetic processes associated with relaxations of the early red‐shifted photoproduct hk; these processes have time constants t1⋍ 280 ns and t2⋍ 360 μs at 20°c. spectral features demonstrate that the t1 process corresponds to a transition between two distinct bathointermediates, hke and hkl. the vibrational difference bands associated with both t1 and t2 transitions are spread throughout the whole 1800‐900 cm−1 range. however, the largest bands correspond to ethylenic c=c stretches, fingerprint c‐c stretches and hydrogen out‐of‐plane (hoop) wags of the retinal chromophore. the time evolution of these difference bands indicate that both the t1 and t2 decay processes involve principally a relaxation of the chromophore and its immediate environment. the decay of the intense hoop vibrations is nearly equally divided between the t1 and t2 processes, indicating a complex chromophore relaxation from a twisted nonrelaxed conformation in the primary (hke) bathointermediate, to a less‐twisted structure in hkl, and finally to a roughly planar structure in the hypsochromically shifted hl intermediate. this conclusion is also supported by the unexpectedly large positive entropy of activation observed for the t1 process. the two relaxations from hke to hl are largely analogous to corresponding relaxations (ke→ kl→ l) in the bacterior‐hodopsin photocycle, except that the second step is slowed down by over 200‐fold in hr.
ciliary neurotrophic factor controls progenitor migration during remyelination in the adult rodent brain in rodents, the adult subventricular zone (svz) generates neuroblasts which migrate to the olfactory bulb (ob) and differentiate into interneurons. recent work suggests that the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) can enhance adult svz neurogenesis, but the mechanism by which it acts is unknown. here, we analyzed the role of bdnf and its receptor trkb in adult svz neurogenesis. we found that trkb is the most prominent neurotrophin receptor in the mouse svz, but only the truncated, kinase-negative isoform (trkb-tr) was detected. trkb-tr is expressed in svz astrocytes and ependymal cells, but not in neuroblasts. trkb mutants have reduced svz proliferation and survival and fewer new ob neurons. to test whether this effect is cell-autonomous, we grafted svz cells from trkb knock-out mice (trkb-ko) into the svz of wild-type mice (wt). grafted progenitors generated neuroblasts that migrated to the ob in the absence of trkb. the survival and differentiation of granular interneurons and calbindin+ periglomerular interneurons seemed unaffected by the loss of trkb, whereas dopaminergic periglomerular neurons were reduced. intra-ventricular infusion of bdnf yielded different results depending on the animal species, having no effect on neuron production from mouse svz, while decreasing it in rats. interestingly, mice and rats also differ in their expression of the neurotrophin receptor p75. our results indicate that trkb is not essential for adult svz neurogenesis and do not support the current view that delivering bdnf to the svz can enhance adult neurogenesis.
analysis of the adenomatous polyposis coli (apc) gene in childhood and adolescent germ cell tumors chromosomal instability (cin), a hallmark of most colon tumors, may promote tumor progression by increasing the rate of genetic aberrations. cin is thought to arise as a consequence of improper mitosis and spindle checkpoint activity, but its molecular basis remains largely elusive. the majority of colon tumors develop because of mutations in the tumor suppressor apc that lead to wnt/beta-catenin signaling activation and subsequent transcription of target genes, including conductin/axin2. here we demonstrate that wnt/beta-catenin signaling causes cin via up-regulation of conductin. human colon tumor samples with cin show significantly higher expression of conductin than those without. conductin is up-regulated during mitosis, localizes along the mitotic spindles of colon cancer cells, and binds to polo-like kinase 1. ectopic expression of conductin or its up-regulation through small interfering rna-mediated knock-down of apc leads to cin in chromosomally stable colon cancer cells. high conductin expression compromises the spindle checkpoint, and this requires localized polo-like kinase 1 activity. knock-down of conductin by small interfering rna in colon carcinoma cells or gene ablation in mouse embryo fibroblasts enforces the checkpoint.
a technique of predicting radiographic joint line and posterior femoral condylar offset of the knee in 99 patients, 107 knee replacements were revised in two centers by two surgeons using a single revision total knee arthroplasty system. a retrospective radiographic review of joint line position before and after revision total knee arthroplasty was made, and compared with the joint line position before primary knee arthroplasty. prospectively collected knee society clinical rating scores were correlated with radiographic findings. the joint line position in unreplaced knee replacements averaged 16 mm, and the joint line position in knee replacements before revision surgery averaged 17 mm. the joint line was elevated by the revision total knee arthroplasty in 85 of 107 knees (79%). after the revision total knee replacement, the joint line elevation averaged 24 mm. the knee society clinical rating score after revision surgery averaged 131 points. if the joint line position was elevated more than 8 mm, the knee society clinical rating score averaged 125 points, if the joint line was elevated less than 8 mm, the score averaged 141 points. joint line elevation after revision total knee replacement is a problem. excessive elevation may result in worse clinical outcomes. distal femoral augments should be used more often and with greater thicknesses. standard implants used for revision surgery should have increased distal dimensions.
the role of the human hippocampus in odor-place associative memory. topographical disorientation (td) refers to impaired orientation and navigation in real-world environments. although numerous cases have been reported, disagreement over neuroanatomical correlates remains. this has been contributed to by concern with the "essential defect," ambiguous terminology, and incomplete assessments. attention to three factors permits a coherent understanding of the widely divergent descriptions of cognitive deficits and neuroanatomical findings: point in course (acute vs. chronic), characteristics of the environment, and a patient's specific cognitive deficits. defects in visual learning/recognition of topographical scenes or spatial-topographical knowledge are common, but the "agnosia" versus "amnesia" dichotomy is an oversimplification: careful assessment typically reveals impairment in both realms. anterograde td is most highly associated with medial occipitotemporal lesions in either hemisphere, especially posterior parahippocampal gyrus, whereas td consequent to right parietal damage tends to be time-limited. persistent retrograde td is attributable to right medial occipitotemporal lesions.
dabrafenib inhibits the growth of braf‐wt cancers through cdk16 and nek9 inhibition braf inhibitors elicit rapid antitumor responses in the majority of patients with braf(v600)-mutant melanoma, but acquired drug resistance is almost universal. we sought to identify the core resistance pathways and the extent of tumor heterogeneity during disease progression. we show that mitogen-activated protein kinase reactivation mechanisms were detected among 70% of disease-progressive tissues, with ras mutations, mutant braf amplification, and alternative splicing being most common. we also detected pi3k-pten-akt-upregulating genetic alterations among 22% of progressive melanomas. distinct molecular lesions in both core drug escape pathways were commonly detected concurrently in the same tumor or among multiple tumors from the same patient. beyond harboring extensively heterogeneous resistance mechanisms, melanoma regrowth emerging from braf inhibitor selection displayed branched evolution marked by altered mutational spectra/signatures and increased fitness. thus, melanoma genomic heterogeneity contributes significantly to braf inhibitor treatment failure, implying upfront, cotargeting of two core pathways as an essential strategy for durable responses.
cyp2d6 gene variants: association with breast cancer specific survival in a cohort of breast cancer patients from the united kingdom treated with adjuvant tamoxifen purpose polymorphisms in tamoxifen metabolizing genes affect the plasma concentration of tamoxifen metabolites, but their effect on clinical outcome is unknown.   methods we determined cytochrome p450 (cyp)2d6 (*4 and *6) and cyp3a5 (*3) genotype from paraffin-embedded tumor samples and buccal cells (living patients) in tamoxifen-treated women enrolled onto a north central cancer treatment group adjuvant breast cancer trial. the relationship between genotype and disease outcome was determined using the log-rank test and cox proportional hazards modeling.   results paraffin blocks were obtained from 223 of 256 eligible patients, and buccal cells were obtained from 17 living women. cyp2d6 (*4 and *6) and cyp3a5 (*3) genotypes were determined from 190, 194, and 205 patient samples and in 17 living women. the concordance rate between buccal and tumor genotype was 100%. women with the cyp2d6 *4/*4 genotype had worse relapse-free time (rf-time; p = .023) and disease-free survival (dfs; p = .012), but not overall survival (p = .169) and did not experience moderate to severe hot flashes relative to women heterozygous or homozygous for the wild-type allele. in the multivariate analysis, women with the cyp2d6 *4/*4 genotype still tended to have worse rfs (hazard ratio [hr], 1.85; p = .176) and dfs (hr, 1.86; p = .089). the cyp3a5*3 variant was not associated with any of these clinical outcomes.   conclusion in tamoxifen-treated patients, women with the cyp2d6 *4/*4 genotype tend to have a higher risk of disease relapse and a lower incidence of hot flashes, which is consistent with our previous observation that cyp2d6 is responsible for the metabolic activation of tamoxifen to endoxifen.
impact of telomerase ablation on organismal viability, aging, and tumorigenesis in mice lacking the dna repair proteins parp-1, ku86, or dna-pkcs how a cell deals with its dna ends is a question that returns us to the very beginnings of modern telomere biology. it is also a question we are still asking today because it is absolutely essential that a cell correctly distinguishes between natural chromosomal dna ends and broken dna ends, then processes each appropriately – preserving the one, rejoining the other. effective end-capping of mammalian telomeres has a seemingly paradoxical requirement for proteins more commonly associated with dna double strand break (dsb) repair. ku70, ku80, dna-pkcs (the catalytic subunit of dna-dependent protein kinase), xrcc4 and artemis all participate in dsb repair through nonhomologous end-joining (nhej). somewhat surprisingly, mutations in any of these genes cause spontaneous chromosomal end-to-end fusions that maintain large blocks of telomeric sequence at the points of fusion, suggesting loss or failure of a critical terminal structure, rather than telomere shortening, is at fault. nascent telomeres produced via leading-strand dna synthesis are especially susceptible to these end-to-end fusions, suggesting a crucial difference in the postreplicative processing of telomeres that is linked to their mode of replication. here we will examine the dual roles played by dna repair proteins. our review of this rapidly advancing field primarily will focus on mammalian cells, and cannot include even all of this. despite these limitations, we hope the review will serve as a useful gateway to the literature, and will help to frame the major issues in this exciting and rapidly progressing field. our apologies to those whose work we are unable to include.
radiological features of childhood giant cavernous malformations cavernous angiomas of the central nervous system are angiographically occult vascular lesions and are easily diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (mri). giant cavernous angiomas (gca) are rare, with only 11 cases reported in the literature. imaging appearance of gcas has not been reviewed previously. we report a gca of the temporal lobe, and discuss its computed tomography and mri findings in the view of the literature. imaging appearance of gcas is variable. some gcas have features that are similar to those of typical cavernous angiomas, whereas some lesions may be purely cystic; and some present with significant contrast enhancement and mass effect, mimicking neoplasms. while the presence of hemosiderin, blood degradation products, and calcification may be helpful in the diagnosis of some cases, the correct diagnosis is not apparent until histopathological evaluation of the specimen is made in many instances.
il-1 receptor/toll-like receptor signaling in infection, inflammation, stress and neurodegeneration couples hyperexcitability and seizures interleukin (il)-1beta is a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in modulating inflammation and stress responses in the brain. central administration of il-1beta impairs both memory functions and long-term potentiation (ltp) induction. however, the molecular events responsible for the downstream effects of il-1beta are not fully understood. given the potential regulatory role of il-1beta in ltp, we assessed whether il-1beta influences surface expression and phosphorylation of glutamate receptors. we found that il-1beta, but not il-10 or tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, down-regulated the surface expression and ser831 phosphorylation of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (ampa) receptor subunit glur1. agents that block il-1beta receptor activity abolished these effects. in contrast, no change in the surface expression of the n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor subunit nr1 was observed. the inhibition of nmda receptor activity or depletion of extracellular calcium blocked il-1beta effects on glur1 phosphorylation and surface expression. nmda-mediated calcium influx was also regulated by il-1beta. these findings suggest that il-1beta selectively regulates ampa receptor phosphorylation and surface expression through extracellular calcium and an unknown mechanism involving nmda receptor activity.
irreversible ototoxicity associated with difluoromethylornithine. this chapter summarizes the reported ototoxicity data on the most clinically important ototoxic chemotherapeutic agents, notably emphasizing the oto(neuro)toxicities of the more commonly administered platinum compounds, cisplatin and carboplatin. currently, in the united states, the only other marketed ototoxic chemotherapeutic agents are nitrogen mustard, alpha-difluoromethyl ornithine (dfmo), and the vinca alkaloids (vincristine and vinblastine sulfate); for these groups, animal ototoxicity data is sparse, and audiovestibular records of human ototoxicity are not available from most prospective, randomized controlled clinical trials. future phase i, ii, and iii clinical oncologic trials of "experimental" chemotherapeutic agents should include methodology for audiovestibular monitoring, just as present fda-approved cancer protocols with either monotherapy or combined therapy of known "ototoxic" agents should include standardized audiovestibular assessment in the database. finally, continued clinical application of cisplatin alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in the successful treatment of solid tumors mandates decreasing or eliminating specifically the dose-dependent sensorineural hearing loss (partially in cases of complete or long-term partial remission) in addition to other common antiproliferation-induced side effects (nephritis, peripheral neuropathy, intractable nausea and vomiting, electrolyte imbalance, anaphylactic-like reactions, and myelosuppression). because of the chemotherapeutic superiority of cisplatin, it is essential to continue to investigate methods of altering the dose-limiting oto(neuro)toxicity without causing a "counterproductive" reduction of the antitumor activity of cisplatin (or other second- or third-generation ototoxic platinum agents).
post-traumatic stress symptoms and post-traumatic growth in 223 childhood cancer survivors: predictive risk factors confronting with a life-threatening illness may serve as an opportunity for self-renewal and spiritual and personal growth. posttraumatic growth refers to the experience of positive change resulting from the struggle and/or cognitive engagement with the existential challenges of life events. the more stressful a life situation is, the more potential it provides for personal growth. this article is a report of a narrative synthesis of empirical research reporting the positive effects of cancer perceived by the childhood cancer survivors and their families. a total of 35 studies included 20 quantitative, 12 qualitative, and 3 mixed studies (involving 2087 childhood cancer survivors, 1115 parents, and 159 healthy siblings). they were published between 1975 and 2010 and conducted in 9 countries. five themes were identified: (1) meaning-making, (2) appreciation of life, (3) self-awareness, (4) closeness and family togetherness, and (5) a desire to pay back society. the findings suggest that illness becomes our best teacher to get to know ourselves at a deeper level and the world in a new dimension with new meaning. working through an illness brings out our best, teaching us what life is all about.
gomisin n in the herbal drug gomishi (schisandra chinensis) suppresses inducible nitric oxide synthase gene via c/ebpβ and nf-κb in rat hepatocytes. aim:  a herbal medicine, kampo inchinkoto (tj‐135), is used to treat jaundice and liver fibrosis in patients with cirrhosis. in the inflamed liver, proinflammatory cytokines stimulate the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) gene expression. over‐production of nitric oxide (no) by inos has been implicated as a factor in liver injury. we examined interleukin (il)‐1β‐stimulated hepatocytes as a simple in vitro injury model to determine liver‐protective effects of tj‐135. the objective was to investigate whether tj‐135 influences inos induction and to determine its mechanism.
targeted and nontargeted effects of ionizing radiation that impact genomic instability. centrosome amplification is common in myeloma and may be involved in disease pathogenesis. we have previously derived a gene expression-based centrosome index (ci) that correlated with centrosome amplification and was an independent prognostic factor in a small cohort of heterogeneously treated patients. in this study, we validated the prognostic significance of the ci in 2 large cohorts of patients entered into clinical trials and showed that a high ci is a powerful independent prognostic factor in both newly diagnosed and relapsed patients, whether treated by intensive therapy (total therapy ii) or novel agents (bortezomib). tumors with high ci overexpressed genes coding for proteins involved in cell cycle, proliferation, dna damage, and g(2)-m checkpoints, and associated with the centrosome and kinetochore/ microtubules. in particular, aurora kinases are significantly overexpressed in patients with high ci, with concordant increase in protein expression. human myeloma cell lines with higher ci are more responsive to treatment with a novel aurora kinase inhibitor. aurora kinase may represent novel therapeutic targets in these patients with very poor prognosis.
reduced total antioxidant level and increased oxidative stress in patients with deficit schizophrenia: a preliminary study dysregulation of free radical metabolism as reflected by abnormal erythrocyte activities of three critical enzymes of the antioxidant defense system (aods), i.e. superoxide dismutase (sod), glutathione peroxidase (gsh-px) and catalase (cat), has been reported in schizophrenic patients. the present study examined the effects of haloperidol, a standard antipsychotic agent, on the aods enzymes, using a within-subject, repeated-measures, on-off haloperidol treatment design. the mean drug free period was 40 days. at baseline, there were no significant differences for all three enzymes between patients and age and sex-matched normal volunteers. during the drug-free condition, sod activity, but not gsh-px and cat activities, was significantly higher relative to normal control subjects. however, within-subjects both sod and gsh-px activities, but not cat activity, were higher in the drug-free condition compared to the treatment condition. no significant correlation was observed between sod activity and plasma haloperidol (or daily haloperidol dose) levels. smoking status, as assessed by the cotinine level, was unrelated to enzyme activities. in addition, none of the major aods enzymes showed significant differences between relapsed and clinically stable patients. these findings suggest that haloperidol may not have direct regulatory effect on aods enzyme activities and that sod and gsh-px activities may change in response to other factors such as change in symptom severity.
functional and mechanistic diversity of distal transcription enhancers locus control regions (lcrs) are defined by their ability, in transgenic assays, to direct high-level, tissue-specific expression of linked genes at all sites of integration examined and at moderately constant levels per gene copy. the most extensively examined lcr is that associated with the b-globin locus in mammals, where the b-globin genes reside in a linear array and are usually arranged in order of their developmental expression (fig. 1). the b-globin lcr consists of several dnase i hypersensitive sites (hss) spread over a region of 20–30 kb; the dna sequence associated with each of the hss contains numerous binding sites for erythroid-specific and ubiquitous transcription factors (for review, see grosveld et al. 1993; orkin 1995; martin et al. 1996; hardison et al. 1997). expression of stably integrated b-globin transgenes in the absence of the lcr occurs only at low levels and varies depending upon the site of integration, and so is said to be subject to position effects. the high level of expression driven by the lcr at ectopic sites appears to be the product of at least two separable activities, namely the establishment of an ‘open’ chromatin domain and direct gene activation. gene activation is also a property of enhancers, which are defined by their ability to direct high-level expression of linked genes in transient transfection assays. although enhancers typically also improve the expression of transgenes integrated into the genome, such expression varies among integration sites due to negative position effects. thus, unlike lcrs, enhancers are only capable of gene activation at a subset of genomic loci. presumably, lcrs subsume the function of enhancers along with a more dominant chromatin ‘opening’ activity that can override negative effects from neighboring regions. in the case of the b-globin lcr, 58 hs2 is known to act as an enhancer in transient transfection assays, but elements in addition to hs2 are required for lcr activity in single-copy transgenes (ellis et al. 1993, 1996). evidence from one study indicates that an otherwise intact human b-globin locus translocated near centromeric heterochromatin may be subject to a position effect (rees et al. 1994). thus, the distinction between enhancers and lcrs may only be one of degree, but in most transgenic assays is still measurable. given the apparent importance of lcrs in the regulation of many tissue-specific genes, the mechanism by which these elements function has been the subject of a great deal of debate. the currently predominant model for lcr function involves the establishment of an open chromatin domain encompassing the regulated genes, with subsequent gene activation accomplished by direct interactions between elements of the lcr and gene promoters by dna looping. in this review, we will summarize models for the establishment of active chromatin domains by lcrs and describe in detail the evidence for the looping model of long-distance gene activation. recent data, especially relating to the function of boundary elements and evidence for facilitators of enhancer and lcr function, indicate that simple lcr–promoter interactions are unlikely. based on these data, we propose an alternative to the looping model, which we term the linking model.
analysis of codon usage patterns in morus notabilis based on genome and transcriptome data. mrna degradation represents a critical regulated step in gene expression. although the major pathways in turnover have been identified, accounting for disparate half-lives has been elusive. we show that codon optimality is one feature that contributes greatly to mrna stability. genome-wide rna decay analysis revealed that stable mrnas are enriched in codons designated optimal, whereas unstable mrnas contain predominately non-optimal codons. substitution of optimal codons with synonymous, non-optimal codons results in dramatic mrna destabilization, whereas the converse substitution significantly increases stability. further, we demonstrate that codon optimality impacts ribosome translocation, connecting the processes of translation elongation and decay through codon optimality. finally, we show that optimal codon content accounts for the similar stabilities observed in mrnas encoding proteins with coordinated physiological function. this work demonstrates that codon optimization exists as a mechanism to finely tune levels of mrnas and, ultimately, proteins.
development of a new folate-derived ga-68-based pet imaging agent in some epithelial cells studied in vitro a membrane-bound folate receptor initiates the process for cell accumulation of 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid. this receptor was found to be gp38, an overexpressed, glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchored glycoprotein, recognized by two monoclonal antibodies, designated mov18 and mov19. using immunoblotting with mov19, radioimmunoassay with mov18 and 19, northern blot analysis, and radioligand binding when possible, we describe the limited expression of the folate receptor in a large number of normal tissues from four autopsies. the immunoblot technique detected as little as 40 pg (approximately 1 fmol) of receptor protein. choroid plexus consistently had the largest amount of folate receptor. other tissues containing substantial amounts of receptor included lung, thyroid, and kidney. the liver, intestines, muscle, cerebellum, cerebrum, and spinal cord were immunologically nonreactive. folate receptor gene expression determined by northern blot analysis confirmed these observations. we also show that several malignant cell lines express significantly more receptor than normal epithelial cells or fibroblasts. specifically, malignant cells bound greater than or equal to 20 pmol [3h]folate/10(6) cells, while normal epithelial cells and fibroblasts bound less than or equal to 1 pmol radioligand/10(6) cells. we also demonstrate that 4 of 6 brain tumors overexpress the folate receptor. these studies reveal the limited normal tissue distribution of the folate receptor, a cell surface protein which may be a useful immunological or pharmacological target for the development of selective cancer therapy.
the effects of periosteum removal on the osteocytes in mouse calvaria prostaglandin e(2) (pge(2)), a prostanoid synthesized from arachidonic acid via the cyclooxygenase pathway, is a modulator of physiological responses including inflammation, fever, and muscle regeneration. several patents have been filed that are related to pge(2), one of them being directly related to skeletal muscles. in this report, we first summarize the key patents describing inventions for the utilization of pge(2) for either diagnostic or therapeutic purposes, including skeletal muscle. in the second part of our work we present new and exciting data that demonstrates that pge(2) accelerates skeletal muscle myogenic differentiation. our discovery resulted from our recent and novel concept of bone-muscle crosstalk. bone and muscle are anatomically intimate endocrine organs and we aimed to determine whether this anatomical intimacy also translates into a biochemical communication from bone cells to muscle cells at the in vitro level. the effects of mloy4 osteocyte-like cell conditioned medium (cm) and three osteocyte-secreted factors, pge(2), sclerostin and monocyte chemotactic protein (mcp-3), on c2c12 myogenic differentiation were evaluated using morphological analyses, a customized 96-gene pcr array, and measurements of intracellular calcium levels. mlo-y4 cm and pge(2), but not sclerostin and mcp-3, induced acceleration of myogenesis of c2c12 myoblasts that was linked with significant modifications in intracellular calcium homeostasis. this finding should further stimulate the pursuit of new patents to explore the use of pge(2) and the new concept of bone-muscle crosstalk for the development and application of inventions designed to treat muscle diseases characterized by enhanced muscle wasting, such as sarcopenia.
prolactin levels correlate with abnormal b cell maturation in mrl and mrl/lpr mouse models of systemic lupus erythematosus-like disease the molecular crosstalk between the interleukin 7 receptor (il-7r) and the precursor to the b cell antigen receptor (pre-bcr) in b lymphopoiesis has not been elucidated. here we demonstrate that in pre-b cells, the il-7r but not the pre-bcr was coupled to phosphatidylinositol-3-oh kinase (pi(3)k) and the kinase akt; signaling by this pathway inhibited expression of recombination-activating gene 1 (rag1) and rag2. attenuation of il-7 signaling resulted in upregulation of the transcription factors foxo1 and pax5, which coactivated many pre-b cell genes, including rag1, rag2 and blnk. induction of blnk (which encodes the signaling adaptor blnk) enabled pre-bcr signaling via the signaling molecule syk and promoted immunoglobulin light-chain rearrangement. blnk expression also antagonized akt activation, thereby augmenting the accumulation of foxo1 and pax5. this self-reinforcing molecular circuit seemed to sense limiting concentrations of il-7 and functioned to constrain the proliferation of pre-b cells and trigger their differentiation.
amitriptyline activates cardiac ryanodine channels and causes spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release solution properties of a drug and its partitioning into lipid bilayers were studied for drug extraction using several different techniques, such as surface tension, zeta potential, ultra filtration and uv-vis spectroscopy. from the surface tension study it was found that the presence of salt makes the drug molecules more surface-active. zeta potential revealed the adsorption of the drug into the liposome bilayers to be governed mostly by electrostatic forces. the drug retention volume was expressed as a capacity factor, k, and that was normalized with respect to the amount of the immobilized phospholipids. the k-values for the positively charged drug on the liposomes decreased in the presence of phosphate buffer due to the presence of the oppositely charged ions. the above methods can thus be used to understand the mechanism of drug-membrane interaction and quantification of drug absorption into liposomes.
oxygen-enhanced mri accurately identifies, quantifies, and maps tumor hypoxia in preclinical cancer models. because of its paramagnetic properties, oxygen may act as an endogenous magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent by changing proton relaxation rates. changes in tissue oxygen concentrations have been shown to produce changes in relaxation rate r1 of water. the aim of the study was to improve the sensitivity of oxygen enhanced r1 imaging by exploiting the higher solubility of oxygen in lipids (as compared with water) to sensitively monitor changes in tissue oxygen levels by selectively measuring the r1 of lipids.
the drosophila transcription factor adf-1 (nalyot) regulates dendrite growth by controlling fasii and staufen expression downstream of camkii and neural activity drosophila calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii is alternatively spliced to generate multiple isoforms that vary only in a region between the calmodulin-binding domain and the association domain. this variation has been shown to modulate activation of the enzyme by calmodulin. in this study we examine the ability of seven of the drosophila isoforms to phosphorylate purified protein substrates and to be inhibited by a substrate analog, and the response of six of the isoforms to a mutant form of calmodulin (v91g) that was isolated in a genetic screen. significant variation in kms for eag, a potassium channel, and adf-1, a transcription factor, were found. in the case of the a peptide inhibitor, ac3i, there were significant variations in ki between isoforms. kact for v91g calmodulin was increased for all of the isoforms. in addition, one isoform, ri, exhibited a lower vmax when assayed with this mutant cam. these results indicate that the variable domain of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii is capable of altering the substrate specificity of the catalytic domain and the activation response to calmodulin.
the accuracy of ultrasound in the pre-operative localisation of parathyroid lesions in primary hyperparathyroidism: a review of the literature aim: to evaluate the role of usg in the preoperative localization of parathyroid adenomas in patients with symptomatic hyperparathyroidism and to compare its usefulness with that of scintigraphy scan and postoperative findings. material and methods: twenty-five patients with symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism were subjected to usg of the neck and nuclear scintigraphy, followed by surgery. the results were independently analyzed and compared with per-operative findings. results: the 25 patients had a total of 28 abnormal glands: 22 solitary adenomas, and 6 multiple adenomas (two each in three patients). usg detected 20 out of 22 solitary adenomas and three out of six multiple adenomas. usg missed five abnormal glands, two of which were in the neck and three in the mediastinum. scintigraphy was positive in 26 abnormal glands, out of which 22 were single and four were multiple. two abnormal glands were missed: one in the neck and one in the mediastinum. conclusion: as limited neck dissection for primary hyperparathyroidism becomes increasingly popular, usg has been found to be a sensitive, specific, and easily available noninvasive investigation for parathyroid localization. it can be easily offered to patients as a method for preoperative localization prior to limited parathyroid surgery outside tertiary care settings.
visual landmark-directed scatter-hoarding of siberian chipmunks tamias sibiricus. it is well established that the hippocampal formation is critically involved in the acquisition of trace memories, a paradigm in which the conditioned (cs) and unconditioned stimuli (us) are separated by a temporal gap (solomon et al., 1986). the structure is reportedly not critical for the acquisition of delay memories, where the cs and the us overlap in time (berger & orr, 1983; schmaltz & theios, 1972). based on these results, it is often stated that the hippocampus is involved in "filling the gap" or otherwise associating the two stimuli in time. however, in addition to the presence of a temporal gap, there are other differences between trace and delay conditioning. the most apparent difference is that animals require many more trials to learn the trace task, and thus it is inherently more difficult than the delay task. here, we tested whether the hippocampus was critically involved in delay conditioning, if it was rendered more difficult such that the rate of acquisition was shifted to be analogous to trace conditioning. groups of rats received excitotoxic lesions to the hippocampus, sham lesions or were left intact. using the same interstimulus intervals (isi), control animals required more trials to acquire the trace than the delay task. as predicted, animals with hippocampal lesions were impaired during trace conditioning but not delay conditioning. however, when the delay task was rendered more difficult by extending the isi (a long delay task), animals with hippocampal lesions were impaired. in addition, once the lesioned animal learned the association between the cs and the us during delay conditioning, it could learn and perform the trace cr. thus, the role of the hippocampus in classical conditioning is not limited to learning about discontiguous events in time and space; rather the structure can become engaged simply as a function of task difficulty.
apoe stabilization by exercise prevents aging neurovascular dysfunction and complement induction the decline of cognitive function has emerged as one of the greatest health threats of old age. age-related cognitive decline is caused by an impacted neuronal circuitry, yet the molecular mechanisms responsible are unknown. c1q, the initiating protein of the classical complement cascade and powerful effector of the peripheral immune response, mediates synapse elimination in the developing cns. here we show that c1q protein levels dramatically increase in the normal aging mouse and human brain, by as much as 300-fold. this increase was predominantly localized in close proximity to synapses and occurred earliest and most dramatically in certain regions of the brain, including some but not all regions known to be selectively vulnerable in neurodegenerative diseases, i.e., the hippocampus, substantia nigra, and piriform cortex. c1q-deficient mice exhibited enhanced synaptic plasticity in the adult and reorganization of the circuitry in the aging hippocampal dentate gyrus. moreover, aged c1q-deficient mice exhibited significantly less cognitive and memory decline in certain hippocampus-dependent behavior tests compared with their wild-type littermates. unlike in the developing cns, the complement cascade effector c3 was only present at very low levels in the adult and aging brain. in addition, the aging-dependent effect of c1q on the hippocampal circuitry was independent of c3 and unaccompanied by detectable synapse loss, providing evidence for a novel, complement- and synapse elimination-independent role for c1q in cns aging.
recall of threat and submissiveness in childhood and psychopathology: the mediator effect of self-criticism. three potential sources of error in retrospective reports of childhood experiences are documented: low reliability and validity of autobiographical memory in general, the presence of general memory impairment associated with psychopathology, and the presence of specific mood-congruent memory biases associated with psychopathology. the evidence reviewed suggests that claims concerning the general unreliability of retrospective reports are exaggerated and that there is little reason to link psychiatric status with less reliable or less valid recall of early experiences. nevertheless, it is clear that steps must be taken to overcome the limitations of retrospective reports and enhance their reliability.
plant jasmonate zim domain genes: shedding light on structure and expression patterns of jaz gene family in sugarcane the phytohormone jasmonate (ja) regulates a wide range of growth, developmental, and defense-related processes during the plant life cycle. identification of the jaz family of proteins that repress ja responses has facilitated rapid progress in understanding how this lipid-derived hormone controls gene expression. recent analysis of jaz proteins has provided insight into the nature of the ja receptor, the chemical specificity of signal perception, and cross-talk between ja and other hormone response pathways. functional diversification of jaz proteins by alternative splicing, together with the ability of jaz proteins to homo- and heterodimerize, provide mechanisms to enhance combinatorial diversity and versatility in gene regulation by ja.
control of the inflammatory macrophage transcriptional signature by mir-155 activated macrophages are described as classically activated or m1 type and alternatively activated or m2 type, depending on their response to proinflammatory stimuli and the expression of genetic markers including inos, arginase1, ym1, and fizz1. here we report that akt kinases differentially contribute to macrophage polarization, with akt1 ablation giving rise to an m1 and akt2 ablation resulting in an m2 phenotype. accordingly, akt2−/− mice were more resistant to lps-induced endotoxin shock and to dextran sulfate sodium (dss)-induced colitis than wild-type mice, whereas akt1−/− mice were more sensitive. cell depletion and reconstitution experiments in a dss-induced colitis model confirmed that the effect was macrophage-dependent. gene-silencing studies showed that the m2 phenotype of akt2−/− macrophages was cell autonomous. the microrna mir-155, whose expression was repressed in naive and in lps-stimulated akt2−/− macrophages, and its target c/ebpβ appear to play a key role in this process. c/ebpβ, a hallmark of m2 macrophages that regulates arg1, was up-regulated upon akt2 ablation or silencing. overexpression or silencing of mir-155 confirmed its central role in akt isoform-dependent m1/m2 polarization of macrophages.
effects of external aba, ga3 and naa on the tiller bud outgrowth of rice is related to changes in endogenous hormones the iaal gene of pseudomonas syringae, subspecies savastanoi, encodes an indoleacetic acid (iaa)-lysine synthetase. to determine the effects of converting iaa to iaa-lysine in whole plants, the iaal gene was fused to a constitutive plant promoter and introduced into tobacco plants. biochemical analyses show that endogenous iaa is reduced by up to 19-fold in iaal plants. tobacco plants expressing the iaal gene display reduced apical dominance, reduced rooting, and inhibition of vascular differentiation. the phenotypic effects of iaal gene expression are reverted by crossing iaal plants with plants that overproduce iaa. these data indicate that iaal can act as an anti-auxin gene in vivo and confirm the role of auxin in the control of apical dominance, root growth, and vascular differentiation in whole plants.
progressive gait ataxia following deep brain stimulation for essential tremor: adverse effect or lack of efficacy? in this chapter brain imaging tools in neurosciences are presented. these include a brief overview on single-photon emission tomography (spet) and a detailed focus on positron emission tomography (pet) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri). in addition, a critical discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of the three diagnostic systems is added. furthermore, this article describes the image analysis tools from visual analysis over region-of-interest technique up to statistical parametric mapping, co-registration methods, and network analysis. it also compares the newly developed combined pet/ct scanner approach with established image fusion software approaches. there is rapid change: better scanner qualities, new software packages and scanner concepts are on the road paved for an amply bright future in neurosciences.
resting‐state functional connectivity of the human hypothalamus the hypothalamus integrates various hormonal and neuronal signals to regulate appetite and metabolism and thereby serves a homeostatic purpose in the regulation of body weight. additional neural circuits that are superimposed on this system have the potential to override the homeostatic signals, resulting in either gluttony or anorexia at the extremes. midbrain dopamine neurons have long been implicated in mediating reward behavior and the motivational aspects of feeding behavior. recent results reveal that hormones implicated in regulating the homeostatic system also impinge directly on dopamine neurons; for example, leptin and insulin directly inhibit dopamine neurons, whereas ghrelin activates them. here, i discuss the predictions and implications of these new findings as they relate to dopamine signaling and the physiology of appetite control.
dep domain‐containing mtor‐interacting protein in the rat brain: distribution of expression and potential implication the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mtor) signaling pathway senses and integrates a variety of environmental cues to regulate organismal growth and homeostasis. the pathway regulates many major cellular processes and is implicated in an increasing number of pathological conditions, including cancer, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and neurodegeneration. here, we review recent advances in our understanding of the mtor pathway and its role in health, disease, and aging. we further discuss pharmacological approaches to treat human pathologies linked to mtor deregulation.
modification of gene expression, proliferation, and function of op9 stroma cells by bcr-abl-expressing leukemia cells in this study, we isolated cd31(-), cd34(-), cd106(-) (vcam-1(-)), and fetal liver kinase(+) (flk1(+)) cells from adipose tissue. these cells can be induced to differentiate into cells of osteogenic and adipogenic lineages in vitro and were termed adipose derived adult stem cells (adas cells). we also showed that they have characteristics of endothelial progenitor cells. in vitro, adas cells expressed endothelial markers when cultured with vegf. in vivo, adas cells can differentiate in response to local cues into endothelial cells that contributed to neoangiogenesis in hindlimb ischemia models. pi3 kinase inhibitor ly294002 blocked the differentiation of adas cells into endothelial cells in vitro. because adas cells can be expanded in culture without obvious senescence for more than 20 population doublings, they may be a potential source of endothelial cells for cellular pro-angiogenic therapies.
large-scale expansions of friedreich's ataxia gaa repeats in yeast. recombination induced by double‐strand breaks (dsbs) in yeast leads to a higher proportion of expansions to contractions than does replication‐associated tract length changes. expansions are apparently dependent on the property of the repeat array to form hairpins, since dsb repair of a caa87 repeat induces only contractions of the repeat sequence. dsb‐repair efficiency is reduced by 40% when dna synthesis must traverse a cag98 array, as compared with a caa87 array. these data indicate that repair‐ associated dna synthesis is inhibited by secondary structures formed by cag98 and that these structures promote repeat expansions during dsb repair. overexpression of mre11p or rad50p suppresses the inhibition of dsb repair by cag98 and significantly increases the average size of expansions found at the recipient locus. both effects are dependent on the integrity of the mre11p–rad50p–xrs2p complex. the mre11 complex thus appears to be directly involved in removing cag or ctg hairpins that arise frequently during dna synthesis accompanying gene conversion of these trinucleotide repeats.
dna repair: lessons from the evolution of ionizing- radiation-resistant prokaryotes – fact and theory dehydration or desiccation is one of the most frequent and severe challenges to living cells. the bacterium deinococcus radiodurans is the best known extremophile among the few organisms that can survive extremely high exposures to desiccation and ionizing radiation, which shatter its genome into hundreds of short dna fragments. remarkably, these fragments are readily reassembled into a functional 3.28-megabase genome. here we describe the relevant two-stage dna repair process, which involves a previously unknown molecular mechanism for fragment reassembly called ‘extended synthesis-dependent strand annealing’ (esdsa), followed and completed by crossovers. at least two genome copies and random dna breakage are requirements for effective esdsa. in esdsa, chromosomal fragments with overlapping homologies are used both as primers and as templates for massive synthesis of complementary single strands, as occurs in a single-round multiplex polymerase chain reaction. this synthesis depends on dna polymerase i and incorporates more nucleotides than does normal replication in intact cells. newly synthesized complementary single-stranded extensions become ‘sticky ends’ that anneal with high precision, joining together contiguous dna fragments into long, linear, double-stranded intermediates. these intermediates require reca-dependent crossovers to mature into circular chromosomes that comprise double-stranded patchworks of numerous dna blocks synthesized before radiation, connected by dna blocks synthesized after radiation.
local features in image and video processing - object class matching and video shot detection we present a new unsupervised method to learn unified probabilistic object models (poms) which can be applied to classification, segmentation, and recognition. we formulate this as a structure learning task and our strategy is to learn and combine basic pom's that make use of complementary image cues. each pom has algorithms for inference and parameter learning, but: (i) the structure of each pom is unknown, and (ii) the inference and parameter learning algorithm for a pom may be impractical without additional information. we address these problems by a novel structure induction procedure which uses knowledge propagation to enable pom's to provide information to other pom's and "teach them" (which greatly reduced the amount of supervision required for training). in particular, we learn a pom-ip defined on interest points using weak supervision [1, 2] and use this to train a pom- mask, defined on regional features, which yields a combined pom which performs segmentation/localization. this combined model can be used to train pom-edgelets, defined on edgelets, which gives a full pom with improved performance on classification. we give detailed experimental analysis on large datasets which show that the full pom is invariant to scale and rotation of the object (for learning and inference) and performs inference rapidly. in addition, we show that we can apply pom's to learn objects classes (i.e. when there are several objects and the identity of the object in each image is unknown). we emphasize that these models can match between different objects from the same category and hence enable object recognition.
new cck2 agonists confirming the heterogeneity of cck2 receptors: characterisation of bbl454 although it is known that panic attacks are triggered by the cholecystokinin fragment cck4, the specific involvement of peripheral or central cholecystokinin cck receptors in various adaptive processes such as emotion, memory and anxiety has yet to be demonstrated. with this aim, we have investigated the biochemical and pharmacological effects resulting from the administration of bc264, a highly potent and selective cck‐b agonist able to cross the blood‐brain barrier. very low doses of bc264 (μg/kg i.p.), increased the exploration of animals submitted to an unknown territory but were devoid of anxiogenic properties in the elevated plus maze. bc264 increased locomotion and rearings of rats newly placed in an open field and improved their spontaneous alternation in a y‐maze. the use of vagotomized animals showed that the increased alternation induced by bc264 did not require an intact vagus nerve, unlike the locomotor activation. these behavioural effects, prevented by the prior i.p. administration of the cck‐b antagonist l‐365,260 but not by the cck‐a antagonist l‐364,718, were shown to depend on dopaminergic systems, since they were blocked by d1 (sch23390, 25 μg/kg i.p.) or d2 (sulpiride, 50 or 100 mg/kg i.p.) antagonists. in addition, bilateral perfusion in freely moving rats of bc264 at pharmacologically active doses, using a newly designed microdialysis system, was found to increase the extracellular levels of da, dopac and hva in the anterior part of the nucleus accumbens. these results show that activation of cck‐b receptors by bc264 does not produce anxiogenic‐like effects but appears to improve motivation and attention, whereas other cck‐b agonists such as boccck4 induce anxiogenic responses. several explanations, including the existence of different sub‐sites of the cck‐b receptor, could account for these differential effects.
pathogen inducible voltage-dependent anion channel (atvdac) isoforms are localized to mitochondria membrane in arabidopsis abstract. in addition to the por1 gene, which encodes the well-characterized voltage dependent anion-selective channel (yvdac1) of the mitochondrial outer membrane, the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae contains a second gene (por2) encoding a protein (yvdac2) with 50% sequence identity to yvdac1. mitochondria isolated from yeast cells deleted for the por1 gene (δpor1) had a profoundly reduced outer membrane permeability as measured by the ability of an intermembrane space dehydrogenase to oxidize exogenously added nadh. mitochondria missing either yvdac1 or both yvdac1 and yvdac2 showed a 2-fold increase in the rate of nadh oxidation when the outer membrane was deliberately damaged. mitochondria from parental cells showed only a 10% increase indicating that the outer membrane is highly permeable to nadh. in the absence of yvdac1, we calculate that the outer membrane permeability to nadh is reduced 20-fold. the low nadh permeability in the presence of yvdac2 was not due to the low levels of yvdac2 expression as mitochondria from cells expressing levels of yvdac2 comparable to those of yvdac1 in parental cells showed no substantial increase in nadh permeability, indicating a minimal role of yvdac2 in this permeability. the residual permeability may be due to other pathways because cells missing both genes can still grow on nonfermentable carbon sources. however, yvdac1 is clearly the major pathway for nadh flux through the outer membrane in these mitochondria.
non-neuronal roles for gdnf and novel gdnf family receptors abstract.glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (gdnf) is a distant member of the transforming growth factor-β family and has potent neurotrophic effects on several classes of neurons including dopamine neurons and motoneurons. here, we have used in situ hybridization to describe the development of the cellular expression of gdnf mrna pre- and postnatally. consistent with dopaminotrophic activity, gdnf mrna is expressed in the developing basal ganglia and the olfactory tubercle. it is also found in a thalamic nucleus, in neurons of the substantia innominata, in the developing purkinje neurons and the developing locus coeruleus area, and in trigeminal brainstem nuclei. in the spinal cord, neuronal expression is found in clarke’s column. gdnf mrna is also expressed in the dorsal horns during development. additional gdnf mrna expression in the head region includes the carotid body, the retina, the vibrissae, the inner ear, the ear canal, and epithelium in the nasal cavity. prominent expression is also found in the developing teeth. the widespread expression of gdnf in developing skeletal muscle is consistent with trophic activity on α-motoneurons. the smooth muscle layers of the gastrointestinal tract are also strongly positive. a very strong signal is found in the outer mesenchyme of the developing metanephric kidney. we conclude that gdnf mrna is expressed in many different cellular systems inside and outside the central nervous system during development, suggesting multiple functions of gdnf in the developing organism.
the genomic footprint of climate adaptation in chironomus riparius patterns of genetic diversity between populations are often used to detect loci under selection in genome scans. indeed, loci involved in local adaptations should show high fst values, whereas loci under balancing selection should rather show low fst values. most tests of selection based on fst use a null distribution generated under a simple island model of population differentiation. although this model has been shown to be robust, many species have a more complex genetic structure, with some populations sharing a recent ancestry or due to the presence of barriers to gene flow between different parts of a species range. in this paper, we propose the use of a hierarchical island model, in which demes exchange more migrants within groups than between groups, to generate the joint distribution of genetic diversity within and between populations. we show that tests not accounting for a hierarchical structure, when it exists, do generate a large excess of false positive loci, whereas the hierarchical island model is robust to uncertainties about the exact number of groups and demes per group in the system. our approach also explicitly takes into account the mutational process, and does not just rely on allele frequencies, which is important for short tandem repeat (str) data. an application to human and stickleback str data sets reveals a much lower number of significant loci than previously obtained under a non-hierarchical model. the elimination of false positive loci from genome scans should allow us to better determine on which specific class of genes selection is operating.
interaction between amyloid beta peptide and an aggregation blocker peptide mimicking islet amyloid polypeptide amyloid aggregates have been recognized to be a pathological hallmark of several fatal diseases, including alzheimer's disease, the prion-related diseases, and type ii diabetes. pancreatic amyloidosis is characterized by the deposition of amyloid consisting of islet amyloid polypeptide (iapp). we followed the steps preceding iapp insolubilization and amyloid formation in vitro using a variety of biochemical methods, including a filtration assay, far and near-uv circular dichroism (cd) spectropolarimetry, 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ans) binding, and atomic force (afm) and electron (em) microscopy. iapp insolubilization and amyloid formation followed kinetics that were consistent with the nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism. nucleation of iapp amyloid formation with traces of preformed fibrils induced a rapid conformational transition into beta-sheets that subsequently aggregated into insoluble amyloid fibrils. transition proceeded via a molten globule-like conformeric state with large contents of secondary structure, fluctuating tertiary and quaternary aromatic interactions, and strongly solvent-exposed hydrophobic patches. in the temperature denaturation pathway at 5 microm peptide, we found that this state was mostly populated at about 45 degrees c, and either aggregated rapidly into amyloid by prolonged exposure to this temperature, or melted into denaturated but still structured iapp, when heated further to 65 degrees c. the state at 45 degrees c was also found to be populated at 4.25 m gdnhcl at 25 degrees c during gdnhcl-induced equilibrium denaturation, and was stable in solution for several hours before aggregating into amyloid fibrils. our studies suggested that this amyloidogenic state was a self-associated form of an aggregation-prone, partially folded state of iapp. we propose that this partially folded population and its self-associated forms are in a concentration-dependent equilibrium with a non-amyloidogenic iapp conformer and may act as early, soluble precursors of beta-sheet and amyloid formation. our findings on the molecular mechanism of iapp amyloid formation in vitro should assist in gaining insight into the pathogenesis and inhibition of pancreatic amyloidosis and other amyloid-related diseases.
laccase from the white-rot fungus trametes trogii a veratryl alcohol oxidase (vao) enzyme was discovered in cultures of pleurotus ostreatus. the enzyme, which oxidizes veratryl alcohol to veratraldehyde reducing o2 to h2o2, was purified to homogeneity and its main structural and catalytic properties have been determined. the enzyme is a glycoprotein and contains fad as a prosthetic group. the amino acid composition and carboxy- and amino-terminal sequences were determined. primary aromatic alcohols with methoxy substituents in position four are good substrates for vao; cinnamyl alcohol is the substrate which is oxidized faster whereas coniferyl alcohol is oxidized at a slower rate. the enzyme is moderately thermostable (t1/2(55 degrees c) about 1.5 h, apparent melting temperature about 60 degrees c). the enzyme stability in 50% water/organic solvents mixtures has also been studied.
dietary intake and eating patterns of elderly people in israel: who is at nutritional risk? objectives the aim of this study was to describe dietary intake and identify predictors of energy and protein intake in a group of high-risk elderly people.   methods all elderly persons receiving publicly financed home care services in the area of sherbrooke, quebec, canada, were eligible. subjects (n = 145) 60 to 94 years of age from three home care programs were interviewed to measure sociodemographic, health, and food-related behavior variables. three nonconsecutive 24-hour recalls were used to describe usual dietary intake. independent predictors of energy and protein intake were derived from multiple regression analyses.   results very low mean energy intakes were observed in this functionally dependent population. more than 50% of the study subjects did not meet the recommended levels of daily protein intake (0.8 g/kg body weight). significant independent determinants of intake were burden of disease, stress, poor appetite, and vision.   conclusions results suggest that community-living elderly people with loss of autonomy may have more nutritional problems than healthy elderly individuals. surveillance of predictors of dietary intake may enable early detection and prevention of nutritional deficits.
a molecular evolution approach to study the roles of tropomyosin in fission yeast background: the regulation of the conformational dynamics of cellular actin structures is poorly understood. results: myosin and tropomyosin stabilize the conformation of formin-nucleated flexible actin filaments. conclusion: actin-binding proteins can play a central role in the establishment of the conformational properties of actin filaments. significance: our results add to our understanding of the mechanisms regulating the conformational and functional versatility of the actin cytoskeleton. the conformational elasticity of the actin cytoskeleton is essential for its versatile biological functions. increasing evidence supports that the interplay between the structural and functional properties of actin filaments is finely regulated by actin-binding proteins; however, the underlying mechanisms and biological consequences are not completely understood. previous studies showed that the binding of formins to the barbed end induces conformational transitions in actin filaments by making them more flexible through long range allosteric interactions. these conformational changes are accompanied by altered functional properties of the filaments. to get insight into the conformational regulation of formin-nucleated actin structures, in the present work we investigated in detail how binding partners of formin-generated actin structures, myosin and tropomyosin, affect the conformation of the formin-nucleated actin filaments using fluorescence spectroscopic approaches. time-dependent fluorescence anisotropy and temperature-dependent förster-type resonance energy transfer measurements revealed that heavy meromyosin, similarly to tropomyosin, restores the formin-induced effects and stabilizes the conformation of actin filaments. the stabilizing effect of heavy meromyosin is cooperative. the kinetic analysis revealed that despite the qualitatively similar effects of heavy meromyosin and tropomyosin on the conformational dynamics of actin filaments the mechanisms of the conformational transition are different for the two proteins. heavy meromyosin stabilizes the formin-nucleated actin filaments in an apparently single step reaction upon binding, whereas the stabilization by tropomyosin occurs after complex formation. these observations support the idea that actin-binding proteins are key elements of the molecular mechanisms that regulate the conformational and functional diversity of actin filaments in living cells.
clinical impact of malnutrition on complication rate and length of stay in elective ent patients: a prospective cohort study background/objectives:invasive procedures such as surgery cause immunosuppression, leading to increased risk of complications, infections and extended hospital stay. emerging research around immune-enhancing nutrition supplements and their ability to reduce postoperative complications and reduce treatment costs is promising. this randomised controlled trial aims to examine the effect of preoperative immunonutrition supplementation on length of hospital stay (los), complications and treatment costs in both well-nourished and malnourished gastrointestinal surgery patients.subjects/methods:ninety-five patients undergoing elective upper and lower gastrointestinal surgery were recruited. the treatment group (n=46) received a commercial immuno-enhancing supplement 5 days preoperatively. the control group (n=49) received no supplements. the primary outcome measure was los, and secondary outcome measures included complications and cost.results:a nonsignificant trend towards a shorter los within the treatment group was observed (7.1±4.1 compared with 8.8±6.5 days; p=0.11). for malnourished patients, this trend was greater with hospital stay reduced by 4 days (8.3±3.5 vs 12.3±9.5 days; p=0.21). complications and unplanned intensive care admission rates were very low in both the groups. the average admission cost was reduced by aud1576 in the treatment group compared with the control group (p=0.37).conclusions:preoperative immunonutrition therapy in gastrointestinal surgery has the potential to reduce the los and cost, with greater treatment benefit seen in malnourished patients; however, there is a need for additional research with greater patient numbers.
novel antiplatelet agents in the prevention of cardiovascular complications – focus on ticagrelor dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel decreases the rate of stent thrombosis in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (pci). however, despite intensified antiplatelet treatment, up to 4.7% of the patients undergoing coronary stenting develop thrombotic stent occlusion, suggesting incomplete platelet inhibition due to clopidogrel resistance. we evaluated the percentage of clopidogrel non-responders among 105 patients with coronary artery disease (cad) undergoing elective pci. all patients were treated regularly with aspirin 100 mg/d and received a loading dose of 600 mg clopidogrel followed by a maintenance dose of 75 mg/d before pci. clopidogrel non-responders were defined by an inhibition of adp (5 and 20 mol/l) induced platelet aggregation that was less than 10% when compared to baseline values 4 h after clopidogrel intake. semi-responders were identified by an inhibition of 10 to 29%. patients with an inhibition over 30% were regarded as responders. we found that 5 (adp 5 mol/l) to 11% (adp 20 mol/l) of the patients were non-responders and 9 to 26% were semi-responders. among the group of non-responders there were two incidents of subacute stent thrombosis after pci. we conclude that a subgroup of patients undergoing pci does not adequately respond to clopidogrel, which may correspond to the occurrence of thromboischemic complications. point-of-care testing may help to identify these patients who may then benefit from an alternative antiplatelet therapy.
transcription factor organic cation transporter 1 (oct-1) affects the expression of porcine klotho (kl) gene klotho is a multifunctional protein involved in numerous biological functions, ranging from mineral ion metabolism to signaling activities. recent studies have identified klotho as a target gene for peroxi‐some proliferator‐activated receptor‐γ (ppar‐γ), a master regulator of adipocyte differentiation, and an adipo‐genesis‐promoting factor. in a similar line of observation, eliminating klotho function from mice resulted in the generation of lean mice with almost no detectable fat tissue. in contrast to the klotho‐knockout mice (11.7±0.3 g at 9 wk), leptin‐deficient (ob/ob) mice are severely obese (49.3±0.6 g at 9 wk), due to excessive fat accumulation. to study the in vivo role of klotho in obesity, we have generated and characterized ob/ob mice lacking klotho activity [ob/ob‐klotho double‐knockout (dko) mice]. the ob/ob mice started to get bigger from 3 wk onward and gained almost 2 times more weight than their wild‐type (wt) counterparts (wt vs. ob/ob: 34.8±1.3 vs. 65.5±1.2 g at 21 wk). the generated ob/ob‐klotho dko mice were not only viable throughout their adulthood but also showed markedly reduced fat tissue accumulation compared to their ob/ob littermates. the ob/ob‐klotho dko mice had significantly (p<0.01) less retroperitoneal, mesenteric, and epididymal fat accumulation, compared to their ob/ob counterparts. similarly, the fatty liver that was consistently observed in the ob/ob mice was eliminated in the ob/ob‐klotho dko mice. such structural improvement in the liver was also evident from markedly reduced fasting blood glucose levels in ob/ob‐klotho dko mice, compared to their ob/ob counterparts (ob/ob vs. ob/ob‐klotho dko: 266 ± 36 vs. 65 ±2 mg/dl). finally, to study whether the absence of klotho can induce resistance to high‐fat‐diet‐induced obesity, we provided a high‐fat (60%) diet to klotho‐knockout mice and compared them with normal‐fat (20%) diet‐fed klotho‐knockout mice. no significant difference in body weight was detected in klotho‐knockout mice fed either the normal‐fat diet or high‐fat diet, while wt mice fed the high‐fat diet gradually gained body weight, compared to the normal‐fat‐diet‐fed counterparts. the results of our dietary and genetic manipulation studies provide in vivo evidence for a role of klotho in obesity and offer a novel target to manipulate obesity and associated complications.—ohnishi, m., kato, s., akiyoshi, j., atfi, a., razzaque, m. s., dietary and genetic evidence for enhancing glucose metabolism and reducing obesity by inhibiting klotho functions. faseb j. 25, 2031–2039 (2011). www.fasebj.org
pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating peptides and α-amidation in olfactory neurogenesis and neuronal survival in vitro posttranslational processing of peptide precursors frequently includes cooh-terminal amidation by the bifunctional enzyme peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (pam). we examined the ontogeny of pam gene expression using in situ hybridization and detected expression in the cardiogenic region beginning at embryonic day 9 (e9) and in decidualizing uterine endometrium and myometrial smooth muscle at even earlier postimplantation stages. pam expression in the cns at e10 was highest in the dorsal spinal cord and floor plate and exhibited complex patterning in several cns regions, including the ventricular zone, over the next several days with pam expression first detected in neurons at e13. high levels of pam expression characterized several nonneural cell populations as well, including limb mesoderm and the mesenchyme immediately adjacent to nasal, maxillary, palatal, and dental epithelia during tissue fusion and remodeling. since alternative splicing generates pam transcripts encoding proproteins that are differentially localized and processed, we used probes that distinguish major subsets of pam transcripts to determine that transcripts encoding integral membrane pam isoforms predominate in most, if not all, pam-expressing cell types throughout development. further, transcripts that encode soluble and cleavable pam isoforms are essentially absent from two cns areas that are rich in transcripts encoding integral membrane, bifunctional pam: the ependymal region of the spinal cord and the ventricular zone of the hippocampus. these results provide evidence for widespread expression and cell-type-specific alternative splicing of pam during development and raise the possibility that region-specific amidation of pam substrates contributes significantly to several developmental processes.
knowledge transfer and exchange context this article presents the main results from a large-scale analytical systematic review on knowledge exchange interventions at the organizational and policymaking levels. the review integrated two broad traditions, one roughly focused on the use of social science research results and the other focused on policymaking and lobbying processes.   methods data collection was done using systematic snowball sampling. first, we used prospective snowballing to identify all documents citing any of a set of thirty-three seminal papers. this process identified 4,102 documents, 102 of which were retained for in-depth analysis. the bibliographies of these 102 documents were merged and used to identify retrospectively all articles cited five times or more and all books cited seven times or more. all together, 205 documents were analyzed. to develop an integrated model, the data were synthesized using an analytical approach.   findings this article developed integrated conceptualizations of the forms of collective knowledge exchange systems, the nature of the knowledge exchanged, and the definition of collective-level use. this literature synthesis is organized around three dimensions of context: level of polarization (politics), cost-sharing equilibrium (economics), and institutionalized structures of communication (social structuring).   conclusions the model developed here suggests that research is unlikely to provide context-independent evidence for the intrinsic efficacy of knowledge exchange strategies. to design a knowledge exchange intervention to maximize knowledge use, a detailed analysis of the context could use the kind of framework developed here.
on-scene treatment of spinal injuries in motor sports background spinal immobilisation during extrication of patients in road traffic collisions is routinely used despite the lack of evidence for this practice. in a previous proof of concept study (n=1), we recorded up to four times more cervical spine movement during extrication using conventional techniques than self-controlled extrication. objective the objective of this study was to establish, using biomechanical analysis which technique provides the minimal deviation of the cervical spine from the neutral in-line position during extrication from a vehicle in a larger sample of variable age, height and mass. methods a crew of two paramedics and four fire-fighters extricated 16 immobilised participants from a vehicle using six techniques for each participant. participants were marked with biomechanical sensors and relative movement between the sensors was captured via high-speed infrared motion analysis cameras. a three-dimensional mathematical model was developed and a repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to compare movement across extrication techniques. results controlled self-extrication without a collar resulted in a mean movement of 13.33° from the neutral in-line position of the cervical spine compared to a mean movement of 18.84° during one of the equipment-aided extrications. two equipment-aided techniques had significantly higher movement (p<0.05) than other techniques. both height (p=0.003) and mass (p=0.02) of the participants were significant independent predictors of movement. conclusions these data support the findings of the proof of concept study, for haemodynamically stable patients controlled self-extrication causes less movement of the cervical spine than extrications performed using traditional prehospital rescue equipment.
modelling off-the-shelf information systems requirements: an ontological approach abstract. information systems analysis and design (isad) methodologies provide facilities for describing existing or conceived real‐world systems. these facilities are ontologically expressive if they are capable of describing all real‐world phenomena completely and clearly. in this paper we formally examine the notion of the ontological expressiveness of a grammar and discuss some of its implications for the design and use of isad methodologies. we identify some generic ways in which ontological expressiveness may be undermined in a grammar and some potential consequences of these violations. we also examine ontological expressiveness within the context of some other desirable features that might be considered in the design of isad methodologies.
variations in internal structure, composition and protein distribution between intra‐ and extra‐articular knee ligaments and tendons the anterior cruciate ligament (acl) is a band of dense connective tissue which courses from the femur to the tibia. the acl is a key structure in the knee joint, as it resists anterior tibial translation and rotational loads. when the knee is extended, the acl has a mean length of 32 mm and a width of 7–12 mm. there are two components of the acl, the anteromedial bundle (amb) and the posterolateral bundle (plb). they are not isometric with the main change being lengthening of the amb and shortening of the plb during flexion. the acl has a microstructure of collagen bundles of multiple types (mostly type i) and a matrix made of a network of proteins, glycoproteins, elastic systems, and glycosaminoglycans with multiple functional interactions. the complex ultrastructural organization and abundant elastic system of the acl allow it to withstand multiaxial stresses and varying tensile strains. the acl is innervated by posterior articular branches of the tibial nerve and is vascularized by branches of the middle genicular artery.
particle impact on metal substrates with application to foreign object damage to aircraft engines the role of foreign-object damage (fod) and its effect on high-cycle fatigue (hgf) failures in a turbine engine ti– 6al–4v alloy is examined in the context of the use of the kitagawa–takahashi diagram to describe the limiting conditions for such failures. experimentally, fod is simulated by firing 1and 3.2 mm diameter steel spheres onto the flat specimen surface of tensile fatigue specimens at velocities of 200 and 300 m/s. such damage was found to markedly reduce the fatigue strength of the alloy, primarily due to four factors: stress concentration, microcrack formation, impact-induced plasticity and tensile residual stresses associated with the impact damage. two groups of fatigue failures could be identified. the first group initiated directly at the impact site, and can be readily described through the use of a fatigue-crack growth threshold concept. specifically, a kitagawa–takahashi approach is presented where the limiting threshold conditions are defined by the stress-concentration corrected smooth-bar fatigue limit (at microstructurally small crack sizes) and a ‘‘worst-case’’ fatigue-crack growth threshold (at larger crack sizes). the second group of failures was caused by fatigue cracks that initiated at locations far from the impact site in regions of high tensile residual stresses, the magnitude of which was computed numerically and measured experimentally using synchrotron x-ray diffraction. specifically, these failures could be rationalized due to the superposition of the residual stresses on the farfield applied mean stress, leading to a locally elevated load ratio (ratio of minimum to maximum loads). the effects of residual stress, stress concentration, and microstructurally small cracks are combined in a modified kitagawa– takahashi approach to provide a mechanistic basis for evaluating the detrimental effect of fod on hcf failures in ti– 6al–4v blade alloys. 2002 elsevier science ltd. all rights reserved.
impact of intestinal permeability, inflammation status and parasitic infections on infant growth faltering in rural bangladesh. human milk was shown to inhibit adherence of giardia at concentrations as low as 0.5%. unsaturated fatty acids were also found to cause significant inhibitory effects on adherence, with ed50 values less than 1 microm for arachidonic, linoleic and palmitic acids. a variety of infant feeding formulae derived from cow's milk and soy bean had suppressive effects on adherence. these observations may explain in part the low prevalence of giardiasis in young infants.
in silico generation of alternative hypotheses using causal mapping (cmap) actomyosin-based cortical contractility is a common feature of eukaryotic cells but the capability to produce rhythmic contractions is found in only a few types such as cardiomyocytes. mechanisms responsible for the acquisition of this capability remain largely unknown. rhythmic contractility can be induced in non-muscle cells by microtubule depolymerization. spreading epithelial cells and fibroblasts in which microtubules were depolymerized with nocodazole or colcemid underwent rhythmic oscillations of the body that lasted for several hours before the cells acquired a stable, flattened shape. by contrast, control cells spread and flattened into discoid shapes in a smooth and regular manner. quantitative analysis of the oscillations showed that they have a period of about 50 seconds. the kinase inhibitors, ha 1077 and h7, and the more specific rho-kinase inhibitor, y 27632, caused the oscillations to immediately cease and the cells to become flat. transient increases in cytoplasmic calcium preceded the contractile phase of the oscillations. wrinkle formation by cells plated on elastic substrata indicated that the contractility of colcemid-treated cells increased in comparison to controls but was drastically decreased after ha 1077 addition. these data suggest that an intact microtubular system normally prevents pulsations by moderating excessive rho-mediated actin myosin contractility. possible mechanistic interactions between rho-mediated and calcium activated contractile pathways that could produce morphological oscillations are discussed.
production of the versatile cellulase for cellulose bioconversion and cellulase inducer synthesis by genetic improvement of trichoderma reesei background: β-glucosidase completes cellulose enzymatic hydrolysis by releasing glucose from cellobiose. results: saxs experiments revealed that aspergillus niger β-glucosidase has a cellulase-like tadpole molecular shape, uncommon to enzymes that act on the soluble substrates. conclusion: we show that anbgl1 n- and c-terminal domains are linked by a long extended linker. significance: understanding anbgl1 architecture is useful for comprehension of the enzyme-cell wall interaction and the process of biomass saccharification. aspergillus niger is known to secrete large amounts of β-glucosidases, which have a variety of biotechnological and industrial applications. here, we purified an a. niger β-glucosidase (anbgl1) and conducted its biochemical and biophysical analyses. purified enzyme with an apparent molecular mass of 116 kda forms monomers in solution as judged by native gel electrophoresis and has a pi value of 4.55, as found for most of the fungi of β-glucosidases. surprisingly, the small angle x-ray experiments reveal that anbgl1 has a tadpole-like structure, with the n-terminal catalytic domain and c-terminal fibronectin iii-like domain (fniii) connected by the long linker peptide (∼100 amino acid residues) in an extended conformation. this molecular organization resembles the one adopted by other cellulases (such as cellobiohydrolases, for example) that frequently contain a catalytic domain linked to the cellulose-binding module that mediates their binding to insoluble and polymeric cellulose. the reasons why anbgl1, which acts on the small soluble substrates, has a tadpole molecular shape are not entirely clear. however, our enzyme pulldown assays with different polymeric substrates suggest that anbgl1 has little or no capacity to bind to and to adsorb cellulose, xylan, and starch, but it has high affinity to lignin. molecular dynamics simulations suggested that clusters of residues located in the c-terminal fniii domain interact strongly with lignin fragments. the simulations showed that numerous arginine residues scattered throughout the fniii surface play an important role in the interaction with lignin by means of cation-π stacking with the lignin aromatic rings. these results indicate that the c-terminal fniii domain could be operational for immobilization of the enzyme on the cell wall and for the prevention of unproductive binding of cellulase to the biomass lignin.
protective effect of zinc chloride against cobalt chloride-induced cytotoxicity on vero cells: preliminary results the effects of cocl(2) on retinoic acid (ra)-treated embryoid bodies (ebs) were investigated. four-day ebs were treated with 5x10(-6) m of ra for 4 d, then subjected to attached culturing for 7 d in the presence of cocl(2) at 0, 20, and 100 microm. differentiation into map2- and gfap-immunopositive cells was inhibited by cocl(2) in a dose-dependent manner. next, ra-treated ebs were dissociated into single cells and cultured for 7 d at an initial cell density of 1x10(3)/cm(2). the number of cells increased in a cocl(2)-dose dependent fashion. in cultures with 100 microm of cocl(2), more than 90% of the cells were immunopositive for nestin and nestin-immunopositive cells formed clusters, while there were few cells immunopositive for map2 or gfap. these results suggest that cocl(2) inhibits neural differentiation of ra-treated eb cells and promotes the proliferation of nestin-immunopositive cells, i.e., embryonic stem (es)-derived neural stem-like cells.
estrogen and estrogen receptor alpha promotes malignancy and osteoblastic tumorigenesis in prostate cancer bone metastases are complications of multiple myeloma and solid tumors, including breast and prostate carcinomas. several reports have demonstrated that the preference to metastasize to bone by tumor cells is not a casual but an addressed event, which relies on specific interactions among tumor cells, bone marrow microenvironment and bone cells. one of the features that gives tumor cells more chances to survive and proliferate into the bone tissue is osteomimicry, that is the ability to acquire a bone cell phenotype, especially osteoblast-like. as clearly demonstrated, prostate and breast cancer cells try to resemble osteoblasts by expressing bone matrix proteins, the specific marker alkaline phosphatase, and molecules regulating the osteoblast/osteoclast cross-talk. based on this evidence it is crucial to dissect in more detail the molecular mechanisms underlying the osteomimetic properties of cancer cells and identify new therapeutic targets eventually leading to a better and prolonged life expectation for patients with bone.
templates for textual use cases of software product lines: results from a systematic mapping study and a controlled experiment the derivation of system test cases for product families is difficult due to variability in the requirements, since each variation point multiplies the number of possible behaviors to be tested. this paper proposes an approach to develop domain test cases from use cases that contain variabilities and to derive application test cases from them. the basic idea to avoid combinatorial explosion is to preserve the variability in domain test cases. new strategies to capture variability in test cases are suggested, which in combination help dealing with all basic types of variability in a use case and in its relationships (e.g., include >>).
token based scheduling of hvac services in commercial buildings this paper provides an overview of research related to use of building thermal mass for shifting and reducing peak cooling loads in commercial buildings. the paper presents background on the concept and the problem of optimizing zone temperature setpoints and provides specific results that have been obtained through simulations, controlled laboratory testing, and field studies. the studies have demonstrated significant savings potential for use of building thermal mass in commercial buildings. however, the savings are sensitive to many factors, including utility rates, type of equipment, occupancy schedule, building construction, climate conditions, and control strategy. the paper also attempts to provide an assessment of the state of the art in load control using building thermal mass and to identify the steps necessary to achieve widespread application of appropriate control strategies.
the clinical features of osteogenesis imperfecta in vietnam osteogenesis imperfecta (oi) is the most common of the inherited connective tissue disorders that primarily affect bone. however, it is a systemic disorder, as evidenced by the occurrence of ocular complications, dentinogenesis imperfecta, hearing loss, joint laxity, restrictive pulmonary disease, and short stature. the oi classification initially included four phenotypes (i–iv) involving col1a1 and col1a2 mutations. three new phenotypes have been added, of which one, type vii, is the result of mutations of the cartilage-associated protein (crtap) gene. investigation of recessive forms of oi particularly reported among south african blacks have revealed mutations involving both the crtap gene and the leucine proline-enriched proteoglycan 1 (lepre1) gene, each involved in collagen proline-3 hydroxylation. issues related to the treatment of oi with bisphosphonates involve patient selection, evaluation of the results of treatment, and the duration of treatment. also, questions exist regarding the difference in treatment response between children and adults with oi. other treatment options, such as recombinant human parathyroid hormone (1–34), rank ligand inhibitors, and stem cell technology, are being evaluated or are of future investigative interest.
hyperbinary expansions and stern polynomials we define a q-analogue of the calkin-wilf tree and the calkin-wilf sequence. we show that the nth term f(n;q) of the q-analogue of the calkin-wilf sequence is the generating function for the number of hyperbinary expansions of n according to the number of powers that are used exactly twice. we also present formulae for branches within the q-analogue of the calkin-wilf tree and predecessors and successors of terms in the q-analogue of the calkin-wilf sequence.
gene expression profile induced by ovariectomy in bone marrow of mice: a functional approach to identify new candidate genes associated to osteoporosis risk in women. estrogen deficiency caused by ovariectomy (ovx) results in a marked bone loss due to stimulated bone resorption by osteoclasts. during our investigations of the pathogenesis of bone loss in estrogen deficiency, we found that ovx selectively stimulates b-lymphopoiesis which results in marked accumulation of b220-positive pre-b cells in mouse bone marrow. to examine the possible correlation between stimulated b-lymphopoiesis and bone loss, 8-week-old female mice were treated with interleukin (il) 7, which stimulates b-lymphopoiesis in bone marrow. we also examined bone mass in il-7 receptor-knockout mice that exhibit marked suppression of b-lymphopoiesis in the bone marrow. the increased b-lymphopoiesis induced by il-7 administration resulted in marked bone loss by stimulation of osteoclastic bone resorption in mice with intact ovarian function. the changes in both b-lymphopoiesis and bone mass in il-7-treated female mice were similar to those in age-matched ovx mice. in contrast, the trabecular bone volume of the femur was greatly increased in both female and male il-7 receptor-knockout mice when compared with the respective wild-type and heterozygous littermates. these results show that the perturbation of b-lymphopoiesis in the bone marrow is closely linked to the change in bone mass. we propose here that the increased b-lymphopoiesis due to estrogen deficiency is involved in the mechanism of stimulated bone resorption.
cross-leg flaps: our preferred alternative to free flaps in the treatment of complex traumatic lower extremity wounds. background: microvascular free flap anastomoses performed for lower extremity reconstruction are traditionally proximal to the zone of injury. the authors assessed the feasibility and outcomes of microvascular free flaps with anastomoses performed distal to the zone of injury. methods: the authors retrospectively reviewed all microvascular free flaps performed at their institution over the past 10 years for lower extremity reconstruction and compared this group with their previously published experience (january of 1979 through august of 1995). between september of 1995 and may of 2005, 119 flap procedures were performed for lower extremity reconstruction. twenty-eight flaps (24 percent) were anastomosed distal to the zone of injury and 87 (76 percent) were anastomosed proximally. there were insufficient data on the location of the anastomosis for four free flaps (all successful). results: twenty-seven of 28 distal microvascular free flaps were successful (96 percent); two (7 percent) required emergent postoperative reexploration of the anastomosis. of the 87 proximal flaps, 79 (91 percent) were successful and eight (9 percent) failed. there was no statistically significant difference in the success rate of microvascular free flaps between the proximal and distal anastomosis groups (p = 0.30, fisher’s exact test). combined with the data from the authors’ previous series (january of 1979 to august of 1995), there were 63 free flaps with anastomosis performed distal to the zone of injury; 61 (97 percent) were successful. conclusion: the authors’ extensive 25-year experience with lower extremity reconstruction demonstrates that in appropriately selected patients, free tissue transfer to recipient vessels distal to the zone of injury is reliable and in certain cases preferable.
isolation and characterization of a gene encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutary coenzyme a reductase from an endophytic taxol-producing fungus bt2 taxus cell culture may be an alternative source of paclitaxel and related taxane production. significantly increased amounts of paclitaxel and baccatin iii were observed in cultured cells of taxus species after exposure to methyl jasmonate. among the three species of taxus tested, taxus media showed the highest paclitaxel content while taxus baccata showed the highest baccatin iii content when 100 μm of methyl jasmonate was added to the culture media. furthermore, the activities of methyl jasmonate and related substances for inducing paclitaxel production were compared in cell suspension cultures of t. media. methyl jasmonate and its free acid showed the strongest promoting activity. reduction of the keto group at the c-3 position greatly reduced this activity. cis-jasmone, which does not have a carboxyl group at the c-1 position, had almost no activity. these results suggest that these two regions of methyl jasmonate are important for promoting the production of paclitaxel and related taxanes in taxus cell cultures.
endogenous swimming rhythms underlying the spawning migration of the blue crab, callinectes sapidus: ontogeny and variation with ambient tidal regime abstract ovigerous blue crabs, callinectes sapidus rathbun, undergo ebb-tide transport (ett) during the spawning migration from estuaries to coastal areas where they release larvae. an initial field study found that only females with mature embryos underwent the spawning migration and that postspawned females switched to flood-tide transport for movement back into and up estuaries. alternatively, a more recent field study found ett occurred in females throughout embryo development and continued after larval release. an endogenous rhythm in vertical migration underlies ett during the spawning migration. a past study found the circatidal rhythm was only present in females with mature embryos but not in females with immature embryos or after larval release. the present study reinvestigates this rhythm in vertical migration. both females with early embryos and postlarval release females entrained in the field have circatidal rhythms, in which they swim vertically at the time of consecutive ebb tides at the collection site or on alternate ebb tides. these results support the field study that ovigerous females undergo ett throughout embryo development and after larval release. thus, females will be transported seaward and release subsequent larval clutches in coastal areas that increase the likelihood that larvae will be transported to offshore developmental areas.
crowdsourced idea generation: the effect of exposure to an original idea this brainstorming experiment assessed the extent to which idea exposure produced cognitive stimulation and social comparison effects. one hundred and sixty participants were exposed to either a high or low number of common or unique ideas. the participants likelihood of engaging in social comparison processes (high or low) was also manipulated through instructional sets. the results indicated both cognitive stimulation and social comparison effects. exposure to a high number of ideas and to common ideas enhanced the generation of additional ideas. the effects of exposure to a high number of ideas was greater under high than under low social comparison conditions. finally, recall of exposed ideas was related to enhanced idea generation. these results are consistent with the social/cognitive influence model of group brainstorming (paulus, dugosh, dzindolet, putman, & coskun, 2002). 2004 elsevier inc. all rights reserved.
perturbation of xenobiotic metabolism in dreissena polymorpha model exposed in situ to surface water (lake trasimene) purified with various disinfectants. trihalomethanes (chloroform, bromoform, bromodichlo-romethane, and chlorodibromomethane) are common contaminants of chlorinated drinking water. although animal data indicate that these compounds may be reproductive toxicants, little information exists on their relation to spontaneous abortion in humans. we examined exposure to trihalomethanes and spontaneous abortion in a prospective study of 5,144 pregnant women in a prepaid health plan. seventy-eight drinking water utilities provided concurrent trihalomethane sampling data. we calculated total trihalomethane levels by averaging all measurements taken by the subject's utility during her first trimester. we calculated exposures to individual trihalomethanes in an analogous manner. women who drank ≥5 glasses per day of cold tapwater containing ≥75 μg per liter total trihalomethanes had an adjusted odds ratio (or) of 1.8 for spontaneous abortion [95% confidence interval (ci) = 1.1–3.0]. of the four individual trihalomethanes, only high bromodichloromethane exposure (consumption of ≥5 glasses per day of cold tapwater containing ≥18 μg per liter bromodichloromethane) was associated with spontaneous abortion both alone (adjusted or = 2.0; 95% cl = 1.2–3.5) and after adjustment for the other trihalomethanes (adjusted or = 3.0; 95% ci = 1.4–6.6).
quantitative morphological analysis of the sensory epithelium of the starling and pigeon basilar papilla the basilar papilla of the barn owl's (tyto alba) cochlea was found to be 9.5-11.5 mm long. histological examination revealed that the sensory hair cells had a characteristic distribution: the proximal half contained mostly typical short cells; tall hair cells were present only on the distal half along with many short cells. lenticular short cells occupied the proximal tip of the papilla. another unusual feature of the proximal part was a dense fibrous mass in the basilar membrane. this was absent from the distal one-fourth.
drug therapy in the prevention of failure of the fontan circulation: a systematic review objectivea single dose of sildenafil improves exercise capacity in fontan patients. however, a recent study failed to show a long-term effect of sildenafil. this study evaluated whether there are factors that might predict sildenafil effects.methodswe studied 36 patients (16–42 years, 14 female) with univentricular heart after various modifications of the fontan surgery (13 apc, 16 avc, 7 tcpc). they performed two cardiopulmonary exercise tests, with at least 120 min rest and a single dose of 50 mg sildenafil in between.resultsafter sildenafil administration, patients improved their peak oxygen uptake from 64.5 to 67.3 % predicted (p = 0.0003) without change in ventilatory efficiency ($${\dot{\text{v}}}_{\text{e}} /{\dot{\text{v}}\text{co}}_{2}$$v˙e/v˙co2 slope), oxygen saturation (spo2) at rest or at peak exercise, respiratory exchange ratio. in addition, resting systolic blood pressure was slightly reduced after sildenafil administration. there was a moderate negative correlation of this improvement to baseline peak oxygen uptake (r = −0.395; p = 0.017). the change in peak oxygen uptake could not be correlated to time of surgery, type of surgery, nt-pro-bnp, or to other clinical data. nevertheless, all four patients with nt-pro-bnp levels higher than 1,000 pg/ml had the most prominent improvements in exercise capacity.conclusionsfontan patients have an improved exercise capacity after a single dose of sildenafil. patients with worse baseline peak oxygen uptake profit more.
potentiating and synergistic effect of grapefruit juice on the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of aripiprazole against hydrogen peroxide induced oxidative stress in mice abstract obesity has been associated with a marked risk of metabolic diseases and requires therapeutic strategies. changes in redox status with increased oxidative stress in adipose tissue have been linked with obesity-related disorders. thus, the biological effect of antioxidants such as polyphenols is of high interest. we aimed to measure antioxidant capacities of 28 polyphenols representative of main dietary phenolic acids, flavonoids, stilbenes and curcuminoids. then, 14 molecules were selected for the evaluation of their effect on 3t3-l1 preadipocytes and human red blood cells exposed to oxidative stress. analysis of reducing and free radical-scavenging capacities of compounds revealed antioxidant properties related to their structure, with higher activities for flavonoids such as quercetin and epicatechin. their effects on preadipocytes’ viability also depended on their structure, dose and time of exposure. interestingly, most of the compounds exhibited a protective effect on preadipocytes exposed to oxidative stress, by reversing h2o2-induced anti-proliferative action and reactive oxygen species production. polyphenols also exerted an anti-inflammatory effect on preadipocytes exposed to h2o2 by reducing il-6 secretion. importantly, such antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects were observed in co-exposition (polyphenol and prooxidant during 24 h) or pretreatment (polyphenol during 24 h, then prooxidant for 24 h) conditions. moreover, compounds protected erythrocytes from aaph radical-induced lysis. finally, these results led to demonstrate that antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of polyphenols may depend on structure, dose, time of exposure and cell conditioning with oxidative stress. such findings should be considered for a better understanding of polyphenols’ benefits in strategies aiming to prevent obesity-related diseases.
effect of ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol supplementations on serum leptin, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and serum amyloid a levels in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus we prospectively examined the relationship between leptin and markers of insulin resistance and secretion and future visceral adipose tissue accumulation. in this study, 518 nondiabetic japanese-american men and women underwent the following measurements at baseline and at 5- and 10-year follow-ups: plasma glucose and insulin measured after an overnight fast and during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, insulin secretion ratio (isr) [(30-min insulin - fasting insulin)/30-min glucose], fasting c-peptide levels, plasma leptin (baseline only), and fat areas (intra-abdominal and subcutaneous) measured by computed tomography. predictors of future intra-abdominal fat (iaf) were determined using multiple linear regression. fasting insulin and c-peptide levels at baseline were significantly associated with iaf area at 5 years (coefficient = 0.041, p = 0.001 and coefficient = 1.283, p < 0.001, respectively) and 10 years (coefficient = 0.031, p = 0.020 and coefficient = 0.221, p = 0.035, respectively). isr was not significantly associated with iaf at 5 or 10 years. leptin level at baseline was positively associated with iaf at 5 years (coefficient = 0.055, p = 0.002) and 10 years (coefficient = 0.059, p = 0.003). in conclusion, higher levels of fasting insulin, c-peptide, and circulating leptin level predicted visceral fat accumulation independent from subcutaneous fat accumulation in nondiabetic japanese-american men and women in both short-term (5 years) and long-term (10 years) follow-up.
combination of epinephrine with esmolol attenuates post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction in a porcine model of cardiac arrest apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is an active metabolic response to physiological signals or exposure to cytotoxic agents. recent evidence has shown that the cell death response can be modified by agents presumed to be unrelated to the initial signal, but capable of interfering with the molecular mechanisms of the apoptotic pathway progression. here we show the results of investigations on the use of a phospholipid-based pharmaceutical preparation for suppression of myocardial damage. first, we show that serum or serum/glucose deprivation, in vitro ischemia with subsequent simulated reperfusion, inhibition of protein synthesis, and treatment with ceramide, staurosporine, adriamycin, cis-platinum and menadione induce apoptotic death in a primary culture of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. then we demonstrate that a mixture of specific phospholipids, which has been originally purified from soy flour on the basis of its anti-apoptotic activity, prevents cardiomyocyte death induced by serum or serum/glucose deprivation, by ischemia with subsequent simulated reperfusion, and by ceramide, but not by other cytotoxic treatments. this suggests that ceramide, a lipid secondary messenger which triggers apoptosis induced by some cytotoxic agents, may be involved in the process of signaling ischemia/reperfusion induced apoptotic death of cardiomyocytes. these results further demonstrate that an active pharmaceutical preparation for the suppression of cardiomyocyte death can be formulated based upon a novel strategy of apoptosis modification.
assembly of membrane-bound respiratory complexes by the tat protein-transport system protein translocation across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane has been studied extensively in escherichia coli. the identification of the components involved and subsequent reconstitution of the purified translocation reaction have defined the minimal constituents that allowed extensive biochemical characterization of the so‐called translocase. this functional enzyme complex consists of the secyeg integral membrane protein complex and a peripherally bound atpase, seca. under translocation conditions, four secyeg heterotrimers assemble into one large protein complex, forming a putative protein‐conducting channel. this tetrameric arrangement of secyeg complexes and the highly dynamic seca dimer together form a proton‐motive force‐ and atp‐driven molecular machine that drives the stepwise translocation of targeted polypeptides across the cytoplasmic membrane. recent findings concerning the translocase structure and mechanism of protein translocation are discussed and shine new light on controversies in the field.
differential responses of pancreatic β-cells to ros and rns. apoptotic and necrotic cell death are well characterized and are influenced by intracellular atp levels. poly(adp-ribose) polymerase (parp), a nuclear enzyme activated by dna strand breaks, physiologically participates in dna repair. overactivation of parp after cellular insults can lead to cell death caused by depletion of the enzyme's substrate beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and of atp. in this study, we have differentially elicited apoptosis or necrosis in mouse fibroblasts. fibroblasts from parp-deficient (parp(-/-)) mice are protected from necrotic cell death and atp depletion but not from apoptotic death. these findings, together with cell death patterns in parp(-/-) animals receiving other types of insults, indicate that parp activation is an active trigger of necrosis, whereas other mechanisms mediate apoptosis.
transcriptional regulation of cholesterol and bile acid metabolism after dietary soyabean meal treatment in atlantic salmon (salmo salar l.). the regulatory control mechanisms of lipid and fatty acid metabolism were investigated in atlantic salmon. we identified sterol regulatory element binding protein (srebp) genes in salmon and characterised their response, and the response of potential target and other regulatory genes including liver x receptor (lxr), to cholesterol and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (lc-pufa) in the salmon established cell line, shk-1. two cdnas for srebps homologous to mammalian srebp-1 and srebp-2 were characterised. we identified three groups of genes whose expression responded differently to the treatments. one group of genes, including cholesterol biosynthetic genes, showed increased expression in response to lipid depletion but supplementary cholesterol or lc-pufa had no further effect. the expression of a second group of genes belonging to fatty acid biosynthetic pathways, included fatty acid synthase, δ6 and δ5 fatty acyl desaturases, also increased after lipid depletion but this was negated by cholesterol or by lc-pufa supplementation. the expression of a third group of genes including acyl-coa oxidase, hmg-coa reductase and elovl5 elongase was increased by cholesterol treatment but was not affected by lipid depletion or by lc-pufa. this same pattern of expression was also shown by liver x receptor (lxr), indicating that acyl-coa oxidase, hmg-coa reductase and elovl5 are possible direct targets of lxr. this suggests that salmon elovl5 may be regulated differently from mammalian elovl5, which is an indirect target of lxr, responding to lxr-dependent increases in srebp-1.
specific effects of a calorie-based intervention on stair climbing in overweight commuters objectives: there is evidence that poster prompts increase stair use. the present study was concerned with the effects of poster size, poster message, and setting on stair use. design: using a quasi-experimental design, four observational studies were undertaken in which stair and escalator use were logged during 2-week baseline periods and 2-week intervention periods. methods: in the first two studies, observations were undertaken in two shopping centres (total n = 30,018) with the size of poster varying. in the other two studies (total n = 37,907), one in a shopping centre and one in a train station, two poster messages were tested in both sites. results: pedestrian traffic volume was controlled for statistically. there were significant increases in stair use with a1- and a2-, but not a3-size posters. overall, the two different poster messages were both effective in encouraging stair use. interactions between gender and message setting, however, reflected the fact that the 'stay healthy, save time' poster had little impact on female shoppers but was highly effective for female commuters. conclusion: these results suggest that developers of health-promotion posters pay attention to poster size. they also indicate that it is insufficient to segment audiences by gender without considering the setting and motivational context.
high glucose level inhibits capacitative ca2 + influx in cultured rat mesangial cells by a protein kinase c-dependent mechanism high extracellular glucose activates protein kinase c (pkc), a family of kinases vital to intracellular signaling. however, which pkc isoforms are involved and where in the cell they operate is unclear. we tested the hypothesis that only those pkc isoforms binding to diacylglycerol (dag) are activated by high glucose. we also reasoned that the isoforms would translocate to different parts of the cell, where they presumably serve different functions. the pkc isoforms alpha, beta, delta, epsilon, and zeta were studied. twenty mm glucose caused an increase in total pkc activity at six hours, which was maintained at 24 hours. high glucose decreased the angiotensin ii-induced calcium signal. this effect was reversed by preincubating the cells with the pkc inhibitor staurosporine. glucose induced a translocation of all pkc isoforms except pkc zeta by western blot. confocal microscopy showed that pkc alpha, beta, and epsilon were translocated into the nucleus. pkc delta showed strong association with cytoskeletal structures. the effects were sustained at 24 hours for pkc isoform beta and to a lesser extent for pkc delta and epsilon, but not for pkc alpha. thus, pkc isoforms differ in their propensity to be activated by high glucose. those isoforms binding to dag are activated. both cytoskeletal and nuclear signaling may be involved.
oral mucosal status and salivary iga levels of hiv-infected children. objective conducted a literature review to identify studies that reported on the oral manifestations in human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infected children in highly active antiretrovial therapy (haart) era.   methods a search electronic data base were used and the terms used were 'oral lesions' and 'oral manifestations'. the studies of prevalence of oral manifestation in children with hiv worldwide, descriptive studies, case reports, studies on the association of oral lesions and levels of immune suppression, use of haart and transmission of hiv were included.   results there have been substantial changes in the management of hiv disease, especially in the past decade because of the use of haart. however, children are still being infected and present some peculiarities when compared with adults. molecular epidemiology, transmission and therapy of the common opportunistic oral infections of hiv disease need to be better understood as a consequence of improved anti-hiv strategies. treatment with haart improves the immune function and decreases mortality, morbidity, and opportunistic infections in hiv-infected persons.   conclusion the frequency and severity of oral disease associated with hiv infection have reduced considerably, although the use of haart may be associated with an increased appearance of oral lesions associated with human papillomavirus and potentially increase the risk of later oral squamous cell carcinoma.
disease surveillance on complex social networks background multiple waves of transmission during infectious disease epidemics represent a major public health challenge, but the ecological and behavioral drivers of epidemic resurgence are poorly understood. in theory, community structure—aggregation into highly intraconnected and loosely interconnected social groups—within human populations may lead to punctuated outbreaks as diseases progress from one community to the next. however, this explanation has been largely overlooked in favor of temporal shifts in environmental conditions and human behavior and because of the difficulties associated with estimating large-scale contact patterns. objective the aim was to characterize naturally arising patterns of human contact that are capable of producing simulated epidemics with multiple wave structures. methods we used an extensive dataset of proximal physical contacts between users of a public wi-fi internet system to evaluate the epidemiological implications of an empirical urban contact network. we characterized the modularity (community structure) of the network and then estimated epidemic dynamics under a percolation-based model of infectious disease spread on the network. we classified simulated epidemics as multiwave using a novel metric and we identified network structures that were critical to the network’s ability to produce multiwave epidemics. results we identified robust community structure in a large, empirical urban contact network from which multiwave epidemics may emerge naturally. this pattern was fueled by a special kind of insularity in which locally popular individuals were not the ones forging contacts with more distant social groups. conclusions our results suggest that ordinary contact patterns can produce multiwave epidemics at the scale of a single urban area without the temporal shifts that are usually assumed to be responsible. understanding the role of community structure in epidemic dynamics allows officials to anticipate epidemic resurgence without having to forecast future changes in hosts, pathogens, or the environment.
lack of seasonal variation in the life-history strategies of the trematode coitocaecum parvum: no apparent environmental effect. the fundamental question of how complex life cycles—where there is typically more than one host—evolve in host–parasite systems remains largely unexplored. we suggest that complex cycles in helminths without penetrative infective stages evolve by two essentially different processes, depending on where in the cycle a new host is inserted. in ‘upward incorporation’, a new definitive host, typically higher up a food web and which preys on the original definitive host, is added. advantages to the parasite are avoidance of mortality due to the predator, greater body size at maturity and higher fecundity. the original host typically becomes an intermediate host, in which reproduction is suppressed. in ‘downward incorporation’, a new intermediate host is added at a lower trophic level; this reduces mortality and facilitates transmission to the original definitive host. these two processes should also apply in helminths with penetrative infective stages, although the mathematical conditions differ.
the ccr4-not complex interacts with the mrna export machinery protein arginine methylation is an emergent post-translational modification involved in a growing number of cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, cell signaling, rna processing and dna repair. although protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (prmt1) is the major arginine methyltransferase in mammals, little is known about the regulation of its activity, except for the regulation induced by interaction with the antiproliferative protein btg1 (b-cell translocation gene 1). since the protein hcaf1 (ccr4-associated factor 1) was described to interact with btg1, we investigated a functional link between hcaf1 and prmt1. by co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence experiments we demonstrated that endogenous hcaf1 and prmt1 interact in vivo and colocalize in nuclear speckles, a sub-nuclear compartment enriched in small nuclear ribonucleoproteins and splicing factors. in vitro methylation assays indicated that hcaf1 is not a substrate for prmt1-mediated methylation, but it regulates prmt1 activity in a substrate-dependent manner. moreover, small interfering rna (sirna)-mediated silencing of hcaf1 in mcf-7 cells significantly modulates the methylation of endogenous prmt1 substrates. finally, we demonstrated that in vitro and in the cellular context, hcaf1 regulates the methylation of sam68 and histone h4, two prmt1 substrates. since hcaf1 and prmt1 have been involved in the regulation of transcription and rna metabolism, we speculate that hcaf1 and prmt1 could contribute to the crosstalk between transcription and rna processing.
decreased fibrinolytic activity is associated with carotid artery stiffening in arterial hypertension aim a prothrombotic state is associated with organ damage in hypertensive patients. carotid intima-media thickness (imt) is an early marker of vascular damage that anticipates the development of atherosclerotic plaques. the aim of the present study was to investigate the relationships between subclinical carotid damage and markers of the prothrombotic state in hypertension.   methods in 258 essential hypertensive patients who were consecutively recruited at a hypertension clinic an ultrasound carotid scan was performed with assessment of the imt and plasma levels of c-reactive protein, fibrinogen, fibrin d-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1+2, homocysteine, and lipoprotein(a) were measured.   results patients with an imt above the median of the distribution (800 µm) were older and had greater bmi, pulse pressure, duration of hypertension, and prevalence of coronary heart disease than patients with an imt below the median. patients with higher imt had also greater levels of c-reactive protein, fibrinogen, fibrin d-dimer, and homocysteine. regression analysis showed a direct relationship of imt with age, waist circumference, pulse pressure, fibrinogen, fibrin d-dimer, and number of cigarettes smoked per day, and an inverse relationship with creatinine clearance. on multivariate analysis, age, pulse pressure, and fibrin d-dimer were independently related with imt.   conclusion in hypertensive patients, subclinical carotid damage is related with evidence of activated coagulation system suggesting a prothrombotic state. this might contribute to the development of hypertensive arterial damage even in the earliest stages.
loss of correction in spinal cord injury-related scoliosis after pedicle screw fixation object pedicle screw fixation has been theorized to provide better correction of scoliotic deformity, but controversy over the benefits of pedicle screw-only constructs remains, and the longer-term impact of pedicle screw fixation as compared with hybrid constructs is unclear. in this study, a retrospective review of a prospectively collected database was conducted to determine the longer-term impact of pedicle screw fixation as compared with hybrid constructs in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (ais).   methods the authors retrospectively reviewed a multicenter database of pediatric patients (ages ≤ 18) from 1995 to 2006 and identified 127 patients with lenke type 1-4 ais curves with a minimum 5 years of follow-up. patients were divided into 2 cohorts based on whether they had undergone pedicle screw fixation or fixation with hybrid constructs.   results the mean main thoracic curvature of 56.1° ± 13.0°, which corrected to 14.9° ± 9.3°, translated into a mean correction of 73% (p < 0.01). the curve was 19.4° ± 10.6° at 2-year follow-up and 20.5° ± 10.4° at 5 years. when comparing preoperative parameters between the groups, differences were noted in the magnitude of the main thoracic curve (p = 0.04), flexibility of the main thoracic curve (p = 0.02), coronal balance (p = 0.04), t2-12 kyphosis (p = 0.02), and sex (p = 0.02). the pedicle screw cohort had fewer spinal segments instrumented (p < 0.01), fewer anterior releases performed (p = 0.02), and fewer thoracoplasties performed (p < 0.01). by 5 years of follow-up, significant differences were apparent between the two cohorts with respect to upper thoracic curvature (p = 0.01), t2-12 (p = 0.02) and t5-12 (p = 0.02) kyphosis, lumbar lordosis (p < 0.01), and sagittal balance (p = 0.01).   conclusions although some preoperative differences did exist, outcomes were comparable between hybrid and screw constructs at 2 and 5 years. however, hybrid constructs required more concurrent anterior releases and thoracoplasties to achieve similar results.
pharmacy students ' care improved hba 1 c levels and quality of life of patients with diabetes objectives the current study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of delivering diabetes education in either a group or individual setting using a consistent, evidence-based curriculum.   research design and methods a total of 170 subjects with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to either group (n = 87) or individual (n = 83) educational settings. subjects received education in four sequential sessions delivered at consistent time intervals over a 6-month period. outcomes included changes in knowledge, self-management behaviors, weight, bmi, hba(1c), health-related quality of life, patient attitudes, and medication regimen. changes were assessed at baseline and after the 2-week, 3-month, and 6-month education sessions.   results both educational settings had similar improvements in knowledge, bmi, health-related quality of life, attitudes, and all other measured indicators. hba(1c) decreased from 8.5 +/- 1.8% at baseline to 6.5 +/- 0.8% at 6 months (p < 0.01) in the study population as a whole. subjects assigned to the individual setting had a 1.7 +/- 1.9% reduction in hba(1c) (p < 0.01), whereas subjects assigned to the group setting had a 2.5 +/- 1.8% reduction in hba(1c) (p < 0.01). the difference in hba(1c) improvement was marginally greater in subjects assigned to group education versus individualized education (p = 0.05).   conclusions this study demonstrates that diabetes education delivered in a group setting, when compared with an individual setting, was equally effective at providing equivalent or slightly greater improvements in glycemic control. group diabetes education was similarly effective in delivering key educational components and may allow for more efficient and cost-effective methods in the delivery of diabetes education programs.
detecting representations of recent and remote autobiographical memories in vmpfc and hippocampus a fundamental question in memory research is how our brains can form enduring memories. in humans, memories of everyday life depend initially on the medial temporal lobe system, including the hippocampus. as these memories mature, they are thought to become increasingly dependent on other brain regions such as the cortex. little is understood about how new memories in the hippocampus are transformed into remote memories in cortical networks. however, recent studies have begun to shed light on how remote memories are organized in the cortex, and the molecular and cellular events that underlie their consolidation.
rats ventilatory responsiveness to hypoxia and hypercapnia in fructose feeding and intermittent hypoxia affect abstract—hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are closely associated with hypertension in humans and in animal models. gender differences have been found in the development of hypertension in fructose-fed rats. the objectives of the present study were, first, to clarify whether androgens are required in the development of hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and hypertension in fructose-fed rats, and second, to determine if cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 are also increased in the arteries of these rats. male rats were gonadectomized or sham-operated and fed a 60% fructose diet beginning at age 7 weeks. blood pressure was measured by a tail-cuff method, and an oral glucose tolerance test was performed to assess insulin sensitivity after 8 weeks of fructose feeding. cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 mrna expression was also assessed in the thoracic aortae and mesenteric arteries. gonadectomy prevented hypertension from developing in the fructose-fed rats, but hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance developed. there was an increase in cyclooxygenase-2 expression in the thoracic aortae and mesenteric arteries of the fructose-fed sham-operated rats while the expression of cyclooxygenase-1 remained unchanged. gonadectomy prevented the mrna overexpression of vascular cyclooxygenase-2 in the fructose-fed rats. these results suggest that the presence of androgens is necessary for the development of fructose-induced hypertension. androgens apparently act as a link between hyperinsulinemia/insulin resistance and hypertension in fructose-hypertensive rats. furthermore, an increase in the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 is implicated in the development of hypertension. the mechanisms involved require further study.
distinct spatiotemporal expression of serine proteases prss23 and prss35 in periimplantation mouse uterus and dispensable function of prss35 in fertility abstract the objective of the present study was to determine how low progesterone (p4) affects the endometrial transcriptome, with specific emphasis on those changes that may impact conceptus elongation. following estrous synchronization and detection (estrus = day 0, n = 40), heifers were randomly assigned to a control group (n = 12) or a low p4 group (n = 28). heifers in the low p4 group had consistently lower p4 concentrations compared to controls (p < 0.05). microarray analysis of endometrial gene expression revealed low p4 altered the expression of 498 differentially expressed genes (degs; 215 up- and 283 down-regulated) on day 7 and 351 degs (272 up- and 79 down-regulated) on day 13. a similar number of temporal changes occurred between day 7 and day 13 in both groups (2212 in heifers with normal p4 compared with 2247 in heifers with low p4); of these degs, 1278 were common to both groups. little overlap in the number of degs affected by high or low p4 was observed across days. comparison of the temporal changes that occur during normal estrous cycle progression (i.e., from day 7 to day 13) to those affected by altered p4 found significant numbers of genes were modulated by elevated (4157) and decreased (809) p4 alone. analysis of selected genes by quantitative real-time pcr and in situ hybridization revealed that expression of mep1b, nid2, and prss23 increased on day 13 compared to day 7 (p < 0.05) and that the magnitude of increase was significantly diminished in heifers with low p4 compared to controls. mep1b predominantly localized to the both the superficial and deep glandular epithelium (ge), nid2 localized to the deep ge, whereas prss23 localized only to the luminal epithelium. in conclusion, we have determined the global changes in the endometrial transcriptome induced by decreasing the output of p4 from the corpus luteum in vivo using a unique animal model. placing these data into context with previous data in which p4 was supplemented or elevated after ovulation, we have identified a panel of genes that are truly regulated in the endometrium by circulating concentrations of p4 in vivo and that likely impact conceptus elongation.
microsporidia-like parasites of amoebae belong to the early fungal lineage rozellomycota free-living amoebae (fla) are distributed ubiquitously in aquatic and humid habitats. in addition to the role of a few species as causative agents of meningoencephalitis and keratitis, fla are frequently considered to serve as natural hosts and vehicles of dierent bacteria ± especially those that cause human illness. these intracellularly growing organisms are thus protected against chlorine ± favoring their distribution within potable water systems and sanitary facilities. this important observation was ®rst mentioned by rowbotham (1986) for legionellae and was shown by in vitro investigations for various bacteria, ®nally sustained by recent ®ndings of burgholderia pickettii (michel et al. 1997), chlamydia-like organisms (amann et al. 1997), pseudomonas aeruginosa (michel et al. 1995a), and ehrlichialike organisms (michel et al. 1995b) multiplying as endocytobiotic organisms within amoebae isolated from natural habitats. recently we isolated an obviously eukaryotic microorganism showing intracellular multiplication within vannella cirrifera amoebae isolated from samples obtained from a domestic potable warm-water system. for proof of the prevalence of fla, 100-ml water samples were ®ltered through membrane ®lters (0.45 lm, nitrocellulose). the ®lters were placed upside down onto nn agar plates according to page (1976) and then incubated at 30 °c. the best growth rates of the parasite and host were observed in cocultures with v. miroides on nn agar supplemented with 1% nonspeci®c ocean salt at 30 °c. growth of the amoebae was investigated daily by light microscopy. for electron microscopy examinations, cultures of 5±8 days were prepared according to techniques described previously (michel et al. 1995b). an infection with intracellular microorganisms could be detected within 2 days of incubation in v. cirrifera trophozoites. the culture of host amoebae and their parasites appeared to be problematic because of a rapid growth of parasites (strain kw19) within their hosts, leading to decay of the amoebic culture. on evaluation of the host range among fla, only one strain of v. miroides appeared sensitive for an infection with the parasite, showing the same characteristics as the wildtype strain, the exception being that the growth of the new host amoebae and their parasites stayed in a better balance, thus enabling continuous culture. phase-contrast microscopy revealed early stages of parasites within the caryoplasm of the host amoeba (fig. 1). the fast-growing parasite expanded the nuclear membrane, ®nally occupying the whole cell after the nuclear membrane had torn. within a period of 3±5 days the infection led to decay of the amoeba, resulting in the release of immobile coccoid stages of the parasite measuring 0.8±1.2 lm in diameter into the environment. electron microscopy examinations showed two different stages of the parasite in the amoebae: (1) the coccoid stage within the cytoplasm of the host cell and (2) the growing polymorphic stages within the caryoplasm (fig. 2). the polymorphous stages in the nucleus grow up to a diameter of 6.5 lm, with intracellular vacuoles and compartments being surrounded by double membranes (fig. 3). at the end of the developmental period the parasite dierentiates into numerous coccoid forms, ®nally occupying the whole host cell. these coccoid stages are provided with a thick wall of low electron density. parasitol res (1998) 84: 164±166 ó springer-verlag 1998
cardioprotective adaptation of rats to intermittent hypobaric hypoxia is accompanied by the increased association of hexokinase with mitochondria. brain hexokinase is associated with the outer membrane of mitochondria, and its activity has been implicated in the regulation of atp synthesis and apoptosis. reactive oxygen species (ros) are by-products of the electron transport chain in mitochondria. here we show that the adp produced by hexokinase activity in rat brain mitochondria (mt-hexokinase) controls both membrane potential (δψm) and ros generation. exposing control mitochondria to glucose increased the rate of oxygen consumption and reduced the rate of hydrogen peroxide generation. mitochondrial associated hexokinase activity also regulated δψm, because glucose stabilized low δψm values in state 3. interestingly, the addition of glucose 6-phosphate significantly reduced the time of state 3 persistence, leading to an increase in the δψm and in h2o2 generation. the glucose analogue 2-deoxyglucose completely impaired h2o2 formation in state 3-state 4 transition. in sharp contrast, the mt-hexokinase-depleted mitochondria were, in all the above mentioned experiments, insensitive to glucose addition, indicating that the mt-hexokinase activity is pivotal in the homeostasis of the physiological functions of mitochondria. when mt-hexokinase-depleted mitochondria were incubated with exogenous yeast hexokinase, which is not able to bind to mitochondria, the rate of h2o2 generation reached levels similar to those exhibited by control mitochondria only when an excess of 10-fold more enzyme activity was supplemented. hyperglycemia induced in embryonic rat brain cortical neurons increased ros production due to a rise in the intracellular glucose 6-phosphate levels, which were decreased by the inclusion of 2-deoxyglucose, n-acetyl cysteine, or carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. taken together, the results presented here indicate for the first time that mt-hexokinase activity performed a key role as a preventive antioxidant against oxidative stress, reducing mitochondrial ros generation through an adp-recycling mechanism.
hdm2 antagonist nutlin-3 disrupts p73-hdm2 binding and enhances p73 function mdm2 is a critical negative regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. recently, small-molecule antagonists of mdm2, the nutlins, have been developed to inhibit the p53-mdm2 interaction and activate p53 signaling. however, half of human cancers have mutated p53 and they are resistant to nutlin treatment. here, we report that treatment of the p53-mutant malignant peripheral nerve sheath (mpnst) and p53-null hct116 cells with cisplatin (cis) and nutlin-3a induced a degree of apoptosis that was significantly greater than either drug alone. nutlin-3a also increased the cytotoxicity of both carboplatin and doxorubicin in a series of p53-mutant human tumor cell lines. in the human dedifferentiated liposarcoma cell line (ls141) and the p53 wild-type hct116 cells, nutlin-3a induced downregulation of e2f1 and this effect appeared to be proteasome dependent. in contrast, in mpnst and hctp53−/− cells, nutlin-3a inhibited the binding of e2f1 to mdm2 and induced transcriptional activation of free e2f1 in the presence of cis-induced dna damage. downregulation of e2f1 by small interfering rna significantly decreased the level of apoptosis induced by cis and nutlin-3a treatment. moreover, expression of a dominant-negative form of e2f1 rescued cells from apoptosis, whereas cells overexpressing wild-type e2f1 showed an increase in cell death. this correlated with the induction of the proapoptotic proteins p73α and noxa, which are both regulated by e2f1. these results indicate that antagonism of mdm2 by nutlin-3a in cells with mutant p53 enhances chemosensitivity in an e2f1-dependent manner. nutlin-3a therefore may provide a therapeutic benefit in tumors with mutant p53 provided it is combined with chemotherapy.
persistent hypogonadism influences estradiol synthesis, cognition and outcome in males after severe tbi background traumatic brain injury initiates several metabolic processes that can exacerbate the injury. there is evidence that hypothermia may limit some of these deleterious metabolic responses.   methods in a randomized, controlled trial, we compared the effects of moderate hypothermia and normothermia in 82 patients with severe closed head injuries (a score of 3 to 7 on the glasgow coma scale). the patients assigned to hypothermia were cooled to 33 degrees c a mean of 10 hours after injury, kept at 32 degrees to 33 degrees c for 24 hours, and then rewarmed. a specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation who was unaware of the treatment assignments evaluated the patients 3, 6, and 12 months later with the use of the glasgow outcome scale.   results the demographic characteristics and causes and severity of injury were similar in the hypothermia and normothermia groups. at 12 months, 62 percent of the patients in the hypothermia group and 38 percent of those in the normothermia group had good outcomes (moderate, mild, or no disabilities). the adjusted risk ratio for a bad outcome in the hypothermia group was 0.5 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.2 to 1.2). hypothermia did not improve the outcomes in the patients with coma scores of 3 or 4 on admission. among the patients with scores of 5 to 7, hypothermia was associated with significantly improved outcomes at 3 and 6 months (adjusted risk ratio for a bad outcome, 0.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.1 to 0.9 at both intervals), although not at 12 months (risk ratio, 0.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.1 to 1.0).   conclusions treatment with moderate hypothermia for 24 hours in patients with severe traumatic brain injury and coma scores of 5 to 7 on admission hastened neurologic recovery and may have improved the outcome.
variability in potency among commercial preparations of berberine metabolic regulation is largely dependent on mitochondria, which play an important role in energy homeostasis. imbalance between energy intake and expenditure leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, characterized by a reduced ratio of energy production (atp production) to respiration. due to the role of mitochondrial factors/events in several apoptotic pathways, the possibility of targeting that organelle in the tumor cell, leading to its elimination is very attractive, although the safety issue is problematic. berberine, a benzyl-tetra isoquinoline alkaloid extracted from plants of the berberidaceae family, has been extensively used for many centuries, especially in the traditional chinese and native american medicine. several evidences suggest that berberine possesses several therapeutic uses, including anti-tumoral activity. the present review supplies evidence that berberine is a safe anti-cancer agent, exerting several effects on mitochondria, including inhibition of mitochondrial complex i and interaction with the adenine nucleotide translocator which can explain several of the described effects on tumor cells.
photosynthetic co2 affinity of the aquatic carnivorous plant utricularia australis (lentibulariaceae) and its investment in carnivory various ecophysiological investigations are presented in aldrovanda vesiculosa, a rootless aquatic carnivorous plant. a distinct polarity of n, p, and ca tissue content per dry mass (dm) unit was found along aldrovanda shoots. due to effective re-utilization, relatively small proportions of n (10 – 13 %) and p (33 – 43 %) are probably lost with senescent leaf whorls, while there is complete loss of all ca, k, and mg. the total content of starch and free sugars was 26 – 47 % dm along adult shoots, with the maximum in the 7th – 10th whorls. about 30 % of the total maximum sugar content was probably lost with dead whorls. the plant was found to take up 5 – 7 times more nh4+ to no3− from a mineral medium. under nearly-natural conditions in an outdoor cultivation container, catching of prey led to significantly more rapid growth than in unfed plants. dm of the fed controls was 48 % higher than in the unfed plants. the controls produced 0.69 branches per plant, while the unfed plants did not produced any. however, the n and p content per dm unit increased by 6 – 25 % in the apices and the first 6 whorls in the unfed variant, as compared to the fed controls. it may be suggested that carnivory is very important for aldrovanda.
intracerebral hemorrhage outcomes following selective blockade or stimulation of the pge2 ep1 receptor reactive astrocytes adjacent to a forebrain stab injury were selectively ablated in adult mice expressing hsv-tk from the gfap promoter by treatment with ganciclovir. injured tissue that was depleted of gfap-positive astrocytes exhibited (1) a prolonged 25-fold increase in infiltration of cd45-positive leukocytes, including ultrastructurally identified monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes, (2) failure of blood-brain barrier (bbb) repair, (3) substantial neuronal degeneration that could be attenuated by chronic glutamate receptor blockade, and (4) a pronounced increase in local neurite outgrowth. these findings show that genetic targeting can be used to ablate scar-forming astrocytes and demonstrate roles for astrocytes in regulating leukocyte trafficking, repairing the bbb, protecting neurons, and restricting nerve fiber growth after injury in the adult central nervous system.
vigorous exercise increases brain lactate and glx (glutamate+glutamine): a dynamic 1h-mrs study coupling between cerebral blood flow (cbf) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (cmro2) was studied using multiple sequential administrations of 15o-labeled radiotracers (half-life, 123 sec) and positron emission tomography. in the resting state an excellent correlation (mean r, 0.87) between cbf and cmro2 was found when paired measurements of cbf and cmro2 from multiple (30-48) brain regions were tested in each of 33 normal subjects. regional uncoupling of cbf and cmro2 was found, however, during neuronal activation induced by somatosensory stimulation. stimulus-induced focal augmentation of cerebral blood flow (29% mean) far exceeded the concomitant local increase in tissue metabolic rate (mean, 5%), when resting-state and stimulated-state measurements were obtained in each of 9 subjects. stimulus duration had no significant effect on response magnitude or on the degree of cbf-cmro2 uncoupling observed. dynamic, physiological regulation of cbf by a mechanism (neuronal or biochemical) dependent on neuronal firing per se, but independent of the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen, is hypothesized.
altered caudate connectivity is associated with executive dysfunction after traumatic brain injury individual differences in striatal dopamine (da) signaling have been associated both with individual differences in executive function in healthy individuals and with risk for psychiatric disorders defined by executive dysfunction. we used resting-state functional connectivity in 50 healthy adults to examine whether a polymorphism of the dopamine transporter gene (dat1), which regulates striatal da function, affects striatal functional connectivity in healthy adults, and whether that connectivity predicts executive function. we found that 9/10 heterozygotes, who are believed to have higher striatal da signaling, demonstrated stronger connectivity between dorsal caudate (dc) and insular, dorsal anterior cingulate, and dorsolateral prefrontal regions, as well as between ventral striatum and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, than 10/10 homozygotes. across subjects, stronger dc-seeded connectivity predicted superior n-back working memory performance, while stronger ventral striatum-seeded connectivity predicted reduced impulsivity in everyday life. further, mediation analysis suggested that connectivity strength mediated relationships between dat1 genotype and behavior. these findings suggest that resting-state striato-frontal connectivity may be an endophenotype for executive function in healthy individuals.
diesel exhaust particles induce oxidative stress, proinflammatory signaling, and p‐glycoprotein up‐regulation at the blood‐brain barrier epidemiological studies demonstrate an association between short term exposure to ambient particulate matter (pm) and cardiorespiratory morbidity and mortality. although the biological mechanisms of these adverse effects are unknown, emerging data suggest a key role for oxidative stress. ambient pm and diesel exhaust particles (dep) contain redox cycling organic chemicals that induce pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory effects in the lung. these responses are suppressed by n-acetylcysteine (nac), which directly complexes to electrophilic dep chemicals and exert additional antioxidant effects at the cellular level. a proteomics approach was used to study dep-induced responses in the macrophage cell line, raw 264.7. we demonstrate that in the dose range 10–100 μg/ml, organic dep extracts induce a progressive decline in the cellular gsh/gssg ratio, in parallel with a linear increase in newly expressed proteins on the two-dimensional gel. using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and electrospray ionization-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry analysis, 32 newly induced/nac-suppressed proteins were identified. these include antioxidant enzymes (e.g. heme oxygenase-1 and catalase), pro-inflammatory components (e.g. p38mapk and rel a), and products of intermediary metabolism that are regulated by oxidative stress. heme oxygenase-1 was induced at low extract dose and with minimal decline in the gsh/gssg ratio, whereas map kinase activation required a higher chemical dose and incremental levels of oxidative stress. moreover, at extract doses >50 μg/ml, there is a steep decline in cellular viability. these data suggest that dep induce a hierarchical oxidative stress response in which some of these proteins may serve as markers for oxidative stress during pm exposures.
comparing the efficacy of intrauterine lidocaine and paracervical block in decreasing the pain associated with endometrial biopsy: a randomised trial objective to compare becteriostatic saline and buffered lidocaine for cervical anesthesia to blunt the reported pain during brief suction curettage. methods a double-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted on women presenting for pregnancy termination procedures. participants received either paracervical submucosal injections of bacteriostatic saline or 1% buffered lidocaine just before cervical dilation. self-reported pain intensity was assessed at three time points during and 30 minutes after the procedure. results fifty-two of 135 eligible women presenting for pregnancy termination procedures participated in the study. pain intensity ratings in lidocaine and saline treatment subjects did not differ significantly at any point. our study had a power of .094 to detect more than a 15% difference on the 21-point box scale between the two solutions. only one patient requested her block be repeated, and she had received lidocaine originally. furthermore, of those women receiving lidocaine, 11% reported mild toxicity symptoms. conclusion to minimize lidocaine toxicity for a brief suction curettage procedure, bacteriostatic saline or very dilute lidocaine could be considered for the paracervical injection rather than blockage of specific autonomic nerves when there is no waiting period. this would mean that the term paracervical block could be changed to cervical anesthesia.
long-term outcome of displaced, transverse, noncomminuted olecranon fractures thirty-seven consecutive olecranon fractures treated with tension-band wiring were evaluated at a mean follow-up of 4 years. there was no or mild pain in 33 cases, mean elbow extension was 7 degrees , and mean elbow flexion was 131 degrees . according to the mayo elbow performance score, the results were graded as good or excellent in 32 cases (86%). most patients had mild residual upper extremity disability (mean disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand score, 18 points). in 10 patients, degenerative changes developed. arthritic changes were significantly associated with elbow instability (p = .014) and length of follow-up (p = .031) and were more common in the presence of associated radial head or coronoid fractures (p = .06). hardware removal was required in 17 cases. tension-band wiring provides satisfactory results in a high percentage of olecranon fractures. however, the outcome may be compromised in the presence of elbow instability and associated fractures of the radial head and coronoid.
contour changes after guided bone regeneration of large non-contained mandibular buccal bone defects using deproteinized bovine bone mineral and a porcine-derived collagen membrane: an experimental in vivo investigation objectives to test whether or not vascularized interpositional periosteal-connective tissue grafts are as successful as free subepithelial connective tissue grafts in augmenting volume defects in the anterior maxilla.   material and methods twenty subjects with seibert class 1 ridge defects in the anterior maxilla were randomly, equally assigned to augmentation by vascularized interpositional periosteal-connective tissue graft (test) or free subepithelial connective tissue graft (control). clinical periodontal parameters at teeth adjacent to the gap were recorded, and conventional impressions were taken prior to surgery (baseline = t(0)) and 1 (t(1)), 3 (t(3)) and 6 (t(6)) months after surgery. the casts were optically scanned, digitized and analyzed for ridge contour changes in the augmented area. data were subjected to nonparametric statistics.   results the contour changes in labial distance between baseline and follow-up for the control group were (median, range) 1 mm, 0.37-1.45 (t(0)-t(1)); 1.18 mm, 0.39-1.40 (t(0)-t(3)); and 0.63 mm, 0.28-1.22 (t(0)-t(6)) and for test group 1.21 mm, 0.74-2.47 (t(0)-t(1)); 1.26 mm, 0.50-1.71 (t(0)-t(3)); and 1.18 mm, 0.16-1.75 (t(0)-t(6)). significantly less shrinkage of the graft was observed in the test group after 6 months (p = 0.03). clinical periodontal parameters at the neighboring teeth were stable over the follow-up period and did not differ between groups.   conclusions augmentation of single tooth gaps with moderate ridge defects in the anterior maxilla was successfully performed using both techniques. however, after 6 months, sites treated by the pediculated graft were superior in maintaining the initially augmented volume and showed less shrinkage of the graft. this could be attributed to better perfusion of the pediculated graft.
mutations in non-small cell lung cancer p 53 frequency of alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking increase the updated consumption of alcoholic beverages is an accepted social custom world-wide. this makes its involvement in events contributing to human cancer risk very important. although it is neither tumorigenic nor genotoxic in animals, ethanol can potentiate the carcinogenic risk associated with certain environmentally present agents. the reasons for such a synergistic action are speculative, but among theories postulated may be ethanol's ability to modify the toxicokinetics/dynamics of carcinogen metabolism. experiments conducted with rodents and primates support this hypothesis, demonstrating increased exposure of posthepatic organs to nitrosamines when given in combination with ethanol, followed by enhancement of dna adduct formation and, at least in rodents, of tumor development. in addition, ethanol may induce enzymes responsible for carcinogen activation, including hepatic cytochrome p450 2e1 in rodents and humans, and in lung, kidney, and brain in rodents. studies have also shown that these effects can extend to the next generation via maternal and in utero fetal exposure. what impact such ethanol-induced modulations have on tumorigenesis during childhood and later stages of life needs to be investigated further.
retraction for dougan et al., probing osmolyte participation in the unfolding transition state of a protein osmolytes are small organic compounds that affect protein stability and are ubiquitous in living systems. in the equilibrium protein folding reaction, unfolded (u) ⇌ native (n), protecting osmolytes push the equilibrium toward n, whereas denaturing osmolytes push the equilibrium toward u. as yet, there is no universal molecular theory that can explain the mechanism by which osmolytes interact with the protein to affect protein stability. here, we lay the groundwork for such a theory, starting with a key observation: the transfer free energy of protein backbone from water to a water/osmolyte solution, δgtr, is negatively correlated with an osmolyte’s fractional polar surface area. δgtr measures the degree to which an osmolyte stabilizes a protein. consequently, a straightforward interpretation of this correlation implies that the interaction between the protein backbone and osmolyte polar groups is more favorable than the corresponding interaction with nonpolar groups. such an interpretation immediately suggests the existence of a universal mechanism involving osmolyte, backbone, and water. we test this idea by using it to construct a quantitative solvation model in which backbone/solvent interaction energy is a function of interactant polarity, and the number of energetically equivalent ways of realizing a given interaction is a function of interactant surface area. using this model, calculated δgtr values show a strong correlation with measured values (r = 0.99). in addition, the model correctly predicts that protecting/denaturing osmolytes will be preferentially excluded/accumulated around the protein backbone. taken together, these model-based results rationalize the dominant interactions observed in experimental studies of osmolyte-induced protein stabilization and denaturation.
glucose is a ph-dependent motor for sperm beat frequency during early activation mammalian spermatozoa expend energy, generated as intracellular atp, largely on motility. if the sperm cell cannot swim by use of its flagellar motion, it cannot fertilize the egg. studies of the means by which this energy is generated span a period of six decades. this review gives an overview of these studies, which demonstrate that both mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, for which oxygen is friend, and glycolysis, for which sugar is friend, can provide the energy, independent of one another. in mouse sperm, glycolysis appears to be the dominant pathway; in bull sperm, oxidative phosphorylation is the predominant pathway. in the case of bull sperm, the high activity of the glycolytic pathway would maintain the intracellular ph too low to allow sperm capacitation; here sugar is enemy. the cow's oviduct has very low glucose concentration, thus allowing capacitation to go forward. the choice of the pathway of energy generation in vivo is set by the conditions in the oviduct of the conspecific female. the phospholipids of the sperm plasma membrane have a high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids represented in their acyl moieties, rendering them highly susceptible to lipid peroxidation; in this case oxygen is enemy. but the susceptibility of the sperm membrane to lethal damage by lipid peroxidation allows the female oviduct to dispose of sperm that have overstayed their welcome, and so keep in balance sperm access to the egg and sperm removal once this has occurred.
contemporary fatherhood and its consequences for paternal psychological well-being – a cross-sectional study of fathers in central europe objective the prevalence and etiology of pre- and postpartum depressive symptoms in women in a variety of family forms have been well documented, but relatively little research has been conducted on the adjustment of their male partners. the authors' goals in this study were 1) to estimate rates of depression during the pregnancy and 8 weeks following the birth of a child in a large representative community sample of fathers in different family structures and 2) to explore the role of stressful life events, social and emotional support, the quality of the partner relationship, and socioeconomic circumstances.   method this study describes the relations of family setting and other correlates to men's depressive symptoms during the pregnancies (18 weeks gestation, on average) and 8 weeks after the births of children for 7,018 partners of female participants in the avon longitudinal study of pregnancy and childhood.   results men living in stepfamilies had-significantly higher levels of depressive symptoms before and after the birth than did men in more traditional families. the effect of stepfamily status on depression was mediated by education, life events, social support, social network, and level of aggression in the partnership.   conclusions there are similarities in the patterns and correlates of depression after the birth of a child for men and women. these findings point to the importance of family and partnership ecology in the adjustment of men before and after the birth of a child.
lower galactosylation levels of the lipophosphoglycan from leishmania (leishmania) major-like strains affect interaction with phlebotomus papatasi and lutzomyia longipalpis lipophosphoglycan (lpg) is an abundant surface molecule that plays key roles in the infectious cycle ofleishmania major. the dominant feature of lpg is a polymer of phosphoglycan (pg) (6galβ1,4manα1-po4) repeating units. in l. major these are extensively substituted with gal(β1,3) side chains, which are required for binding to midgut lectins and survival. we utilized evolutionary polymorphisms in lpg structure and cross-species transfections to recover genes encoding the lpg side chain β1,3-galactosyltransferases (βgalts). a dispersed family of six scg genes was recovered, whose predicted proteins exhibited characteristics of eukaryotic galts. at least four of these proteins showed significant lpg side chain βgalt activity; scg3 exhibited initiating galt activity whereas scg2 showed both initiating and elongating galt activity. however, the activity ofscg2 was context-dependent, being largely silent in its normal genomic milieu, and different strains show considerable variation in the extent of lpg galactosylation. thus thel. major genome encodes a family of scgs with varying specificity and activity, and we propose that strain-specific lpg galactosylation patterns reflect differences in their expression.
the arabidopsis pxa 1 mutant is defective in an atp-binding cassette transporter-like protein required for peroxisomal fatty acid-oxidation 1 the adrenoleukodystrophy protein (aldp) is an atp-binding cassette (abc) transporter in the human peroxisome membrane. it is defective in x chromosome-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ald), a neurodegenerative disorder with impaired peroxisomal oxidation of very long chain fatty acids. we report cloning and characterization of pxa1, a yeast gene encoding a protein (pxa1p) exhibiting high similarity to aldp. disruption of pxa1 results in impaired growth on oleic acid and reduced ability to oxidize oleate. pxa1p is peroxisome associated; however, in the pxa1 mutant yeast, as in ald cells, peroxisomes are morphologically intact. disruption of a second yeast gene, ykl741, which encodes a more distantly related aldp homolog (yk174p), in either wild-type or pxa1 mutant yeast, results in a growth phenotype identical to that of the pxa1 mutant. this result suggests that yk1741p and pxa1p may be subunits of the same transporter. sequence analysis of pxa1p, aldp, and related abc transporters reveals a possible fatty acid binding domain and a 14-amino acid eaa-like motif, previously described only in prokaryotes. because of the similarities in sequence and function, we propose that pxa1p is the saccharomyces cerevisiae ortholog of aldp.
vermicomposting of vegetable market waste using perionyx ceylanensis recycling of guar gum industrial waste through vermitechnology was studied under laboratory conditions by using composting earthworm perionyx excavatus (perrier). three different combination of guar gum industrial waste namely guar gum industrial waste:cow dung:saw dust in 40:30:30 ratio (t1), guar gum industrial waste:cow dung:saw dust in 60:20:20 ratio (t2), and guar gum industrial waste:cow dung:saw dust in 75:15:10 ratio (t3) were used for vermicomposting experiments. chemical changes during vermicomposting were measured and comparatively t2 showed great increase (from its initial level) for total n (25.4%), phosphorus (72.8%) and potassium (20.9%) than the other treatments. t2 also showed higher vermicomposting coefficient (vc), higher mean biomass for p. excavatus (146.68 mg) and higher cocoon production (about 21.9% and 645.5% more than the t1 and t3, respectively). maximum earthworm mortality during vermicomposting was recorded with t3 treatment while zero mortality was recorded for t2 treatment after 150 days. overall, t2 treatment appeared to be an ideal combination for enhancing maximum biopotential of earthworms to management guar gum industrial waste as well as for earthworm biomass and cocoon production.
tako-tsubo syndrome: an important differential diagnosis in patients with acute chest pain key summary points the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome is a novel cardiac syndrome. it is characterized by peculiar transient apical ballooning of the left ventricle, which is the result of characteristic wall-motion abnormalities in the left ventricular apex and mid-ventricle. despite the absence of obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease, clinical presentation in patients with the syndrome is similar to that of patients with st-segment elevation myocardial infarction. postmenopausal women seem to be most at risk for developing the syndrome. an episode of acute emotional or physiologic stress seems to often precede presentation with the syndrome. patients with the syndrome should be monitored and treated for left heart failure, dynamic intraventricular obstruction, arrhythmias, and mechanical complications, should they develop. patients with the syndrome seem to have a favorable in-hospital prognosis despite the development of acute left-sided heart failure and hemodynamic instability in many patients. the cause of the syndrome is not yet known. the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome, also known as takotsubo cardiomyopathy, is a recently described novel acute cardiac syndrome. the syndrome is characterized by peculiar, yet characteristic, transient regional systolic dysfunction involving the left ventricular apex and mid-ventricle with hyperkinesis of the basal left ventricular segments. the syndrome was initially recognized and reported in the japanese population (1-6). dote and colleagues (1) were one of the first to describe the syndrome, which was given the moniker tako-tsubo-like left ventricular dysfunction, naming it after a round-bottomed narrow-necked japanese fishing pot used for trapping octopus (figure 1, parts a, b, and c). more recently, the condition has been called transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome in reference to the associated left ventricular morphologic features that accompany the syndrome. after the initial recognition and description of the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome in the japanese population, subsequent recent reports have documented the syndrome in the united states (7) and belgium (8). despite the acute onset of transient left ventricular systolic dysfunction involving the left ventricular apex and mid-ventricle, patients with the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome do not have obstructive atherosclerotic coronary disease. the cause of the syndrome is unknown. figure 1. left ventriculograms (end-systole) of 2 patients with the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome and examples of a tako-tsubo. a. b c d e d e american heart journal available case series of the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome have included relatively few patients. this review presents reported case series of the syndrome in order to more precisely summarize the demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of patients presenting with the syndrome. in addition, we review the available literature evaluating possible pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for the syndrome. methods literature search and identification of relevant studies we identified relevant english-language articles pertaining to the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome by searching the pubmed and embase databases (through june 2004). the following search terms were used to identify primary articles: left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome, takotsubo cardiomyopathy, ampulla cardiomyopathy, and transient left ventricular dysfunction. we then manually searched references from the primary articles. we included only peer-reviewed reports and did not search for unpublished data. when more than 1 case series was reported from the same medical center, we included the case series reporting on the largest number of patients and excluded those with fewer patients to avoid duplicate reporting. only case series reporting on at least 5 consecutive patients with the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome were initially identified and assessed for potential inclusion in this case series review. case reports and small case series reporting on fewer than 5 patients were not included in the review in an attempt to minimize potential reporting bias of uncharacteristic or nonrepresentative cases. we included prospective and retrospective case series. figure 2 outlines the search and selection process. figure 2. study identification. case series and data assessment we identified 13 case series for potential inclusion in this review. of these, 10 reported on unselected, consecutive patients with the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome. seven of these 10 case series reported on patients who met the following criteria and were subsequently included in this review. first, the patient must have had transient apical and midleft ventricular wall-motion abnormalities resulting in the left ventricular morphologic appearance of apical ballooning. second, coronary angiography data that excluded obstructive atherothrombotic coronary artery disease as the causative mechanism for left ventricular dysfunction had to be available. third, the study had to report on patient demographic characteristics, presenting symptoms, clinical presentation, electrocardiographic characteristics, laboratory data, cardiac catheterization data, clinical complications, and clinical outcome. of the 3 excluded series reporting on consecutive patients, 2 were excluded because they lacked coronary angiography data for all patients (9, 10), and 1 was excluded because it reported on only 2 patients (11). in addition, data that addressed potential pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome were identified by using the search strategy described earlier. these data were then reviewed and summarized. one author read and assessed all studies. results table 1 summarizes the 7 case series that met the inclusion criteria for this review. of these, 5 reports were from japan (2-6), 1 was from the united states (7), and 1 was from belgium (8). three studies reported prospectively collected data, 2 studies reported retrospective data, and 2 studies did not specify the prospective or retrospective nature of the study. table 1. demographic and clinical characteristics of consecutive patients given a diagnosis of the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome demographic characteristics and presenting symptoms all 7 case series consistently reported a sex discrepancy in patients presenting with the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome: most patients were women (range, 82% to 100%). the mean age of patients presenting with the syndrome was 62 to 75 years (overall range, 10 to 88 years). patients often presented with chest pain at rest (33% to 71%), although dyspnea as the initial symptom was not uncommon. isolated cases of syncope as the presenting symptom have been reported (2, 4, 5, 7). electrocardiographic data the most common finding on the admission electrocardiogram was st-segment elevation (range, 46% to 100% of patients). all series except 1 reported st-segment elevation in at least 81% of patients. st-segment elevation, when present, was most often reported in the precordial leads. concomitant st-segment elevation in the inferior leads has been reported in a few cases, and isolated inferior or lateral st-segment elevation seems to be an unusual electrocardiographic finding in patients presenting with the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome. new left and right bundle-branch block on the presenting electrocardiogram has been reported. almost all series patients developed evolutionary t-wave inversions that were usually present in most leads. new pathologic q waves on the electrocardiogram were reported in 6% to 31% of patients; in some instances, the q waves were transient. the corrected qt interval on the presenting electrocardiogram was prolonged; it ranged from a mean of 450 milliseconds to 501 milliseconds. cardiac enzyme and biomarker release most patients had a small, rapid increase in cardiac enzyme and biomarker levels. fifty-six percent to 100% of patients had a peak cardiac enzyme or biomarker level above the upper limit of normal. the series reporting a 56% incidence of cardiac enzyme increase assessed only creatine kinase (3), whereas the 2 series reporting a 100% incidence of biomarker release evaluated cardiac troponin (7, 8). several series have reported that peak cardiac biomarker levels are often those drawn at the time of initial presentation; they appear to not follow the slow rise-and- fall kinetics observed with conventional myocardial infarction. angiographic data and left ventricular function patients with the transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome had either no angiographically detectable coronary disease (range, 25% to 100% of patients) or nonobstructive coronary disease (range, 0% to 75% of patients). none of the patients had epicardial stenosis greater than 50% of the luminal coronary artery diameter. patients with the syndrome had an abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction at presentation (mean, 0.39 to 0.49) that improved rapidly over a period of days to weeks (mean follow-up left ventricular ejection fraction, 0.60 to 0.76). apical and mid-ventricular regional wall-motion abnormalities completely resolved in most patients and followed a time course similar to that of the associated improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction. four studies reported endomyocardial biopsy results in the acute phase of the syndrome (n=

psychometric evaluation of the ‘reading the mind in the eyes’ test with samples of different ages from a polish population the present paper investigated recognition errors in affective judgement of facial emotional expressions. twenty-eight females and sixteen males participated in the study. the results showed that in both males and females emotional displays could be correctly classified, but females had a higher rate of correct classification; males were more likely to have difficulty distinguishing one emotion from another. females rated emotions identically regardless of whether the emotion was displayed by a male or female face. furthermore, the two-factor structure of emotion, based on a valence and an arousal dimension, was only present for female subjects. these results further extend our knowledge about gender differences in affective information processing.
regression of cutaneous tumor lesions in patients intratumorally injected with a recombinant single-chain antibody-toxin targeted to erbb2/her2 abstract. the tumour antigen erbb-2 belongs to the epidermal growth factor receptor family. numerous studies have shown that erbb-2 is overexpressed in many cancers and it is prognostically important in a subset of malignancies. it is well recognised that this receptor has many characteristics that make it an excellent target for tumour-specific immunotherapy. one anti-erbb-2 monoclonal antibody, herceptin or trastuzumab, has already shown clinical efficacy for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. however, despite this success, it is still currently unclear how monoclonal antibodies inhibit tumour growth in vivo. this review will summarise the biological activities of a range of anti-erbb-2 mabs, as well as their possible mechanisms of action. in addition, as an active mode of immunotherapy, the current vaccine strategies for inducing or enhancing erbb-2-specific immunity will also be discussed. it is anticipated that a better understanding of the activities of anti-erbb-2 mabs will aid in the development of both passive and active immunotherapies against this important receptor.
simultaneous measurement of noise-activated middle-ear muscle reflex and stimulus frequency otoacoustic emissions it is well established that low-level broad band noise can elicit an amplitude decrease in evoked otoacoustic emissions recorded in the opposite ear. however, the influence of the temporal characteristics of the contralateral stimulus on this effect remains largely unknown. in the present study, otoacoustic emissions evoked by 60 db spl clicks were recorded in 19 normal-hearing subjects using the otodynamics il088, successively in absence and presence of a contralateral noise that was either steady or modulated sinusoidally in amplitude at different depths (from 25% to 100% in 25 point steps) and rates (from 50 hz to 800 hz in half-octave steps). the energy was kept constant whatever the modulation depth. the results showed that the evoked otoacoustic-emission attenuation effect induced by contralateral stimulation varied depending on the modulation depth and frequency of the contralateral amplitude-modulated noise. the largest suppression effect was observed at the 100 hz modulation frequency and the 100% modulation depth. the 50 hz modulation resulted in less suppression than with unmodulated noise. an interpretation of these results in terms of the influence of temporal amplitude fluctuations falling within a certain range on medial olivocochlear bundle activity is discussed.
chronology of upr activation in skeletal muscle adaptations to chronic contractile activity. chronic contractile activity produces mitochondrial biogenesis in muscle. this adaptation results in a significant shift in adenine nucleotide metabolism, with attendant improvements in fatigue resistance. the vast majority of mitochondrial proteins are derived from the nuclear genome, necessitating the transcription of genes, the translation of mrna into protein, the targeting of the protein to a mitochondrial compartment via the import machinery, and the assembly of multisubunit enzyme complexes in the respiratory chain or matrix. putative signals involved in initiating this pathway of gene expression in response to contractile activity likely arise from combinations of accelerations in atp turnover or imbalances between mitochondrial atp synthesis and cellular atp demand, and ca(2+) fluxes. these rapid events are followed by the activation of exercise-responsive kinases, which phosphorylate proteins such as transcription factors, which subsequently bind to upstream regulatory regions in dna, to alter transcription rates. contractile activity increases the mrna levels of nuclear-encoded proteins such as cytochrome c and mitochondrial transcription factor a (tfam) and mrna levels of upstream transcription factors like c-jun and nuclear respiratory factor-1 (nrf-1). mrna level changes are often most evident during the postexercise recovery period, and they can occur as a result of contractile activity-induced increases in transcription or mrna stability. tfam is imported into mitochondria and controls the expression of mitochondrial dna (mtdna). mtdna contributes only 13 protein products to the respiratory chain, but they are vital for electron transport and atp synthesis. contractile activity increases tfam expression and accelerates its import into mitochondria, resulting in increased mtdna transcription and replication. the result of this coordinated expression of the nuclear and the mitochondrial genomes, along with poorly understood changes in phospholipid synthesis, is an expansion of the muscle mitochondrial reticulum. further understanding of 1) regulation of mtdna expression, 2) upstream activators of nrf-1 and other transcription factors, 3) the identity of mrna stabilizing proteins, and 4) potential of contractile activity-induced changes in apoptotic signals are warranted.
molecular detection and comparison of acanthamoeba genotypes in different functions of watersheds in taiwan in this study, 14 isolates of acanthamoeba from both clinical and environmental sources belonging to seven different species were assayed for tolerance of high osmotic pressure, temperature tolerance, extracellular proteases, and cytopathic effects (cpe) on immortalized rabbit corneal epithelial cells. on the basis of the results, amoeba isolates were divided into pathogenic and nonpathogenic groups. ribosomal dna sequencing was performed on these isolates. phylogenetic relationships revealed that all the pathogenic strains tested clustered together as one group, while nonpathogenic strains clustered into other groups. sequence comparisons with previously published sequences determined that among the six new pathogenic isolates used in this study, five belong to t4 genotype and one to t11. this is the first report of a t11 genotype being found in acanthamoeba keratitis.
a role for the girk3 subunit in methamphetamine-induced attenuation of gabab receptor-activated girk currents in vta dopamine neurons single or repeated exposure to psychostimulants such as amphetamines and cocaine after postnatal week 3 leads to an enduring enhancement in the psychotomimetic responses elicited by a subsequent challenge of a stimulant in rodents. this behavioral sensitization phenomenon has been considered to be the neural consequences of stimulant-induced alterations in gene expression in the brain after a critical period of postnatal development. using a differential cloning technique, rna arbitrarily primed pcr, we have now identified from the rat neocortex a novel and developmentally regulated methamphetamine (map)-inducible gene mrt1 (map responsive transcript 1). mrt1 encodes two major types of pdz- and px-domains containing proteins of approximately 62 kda in size with different carboxy termini, mrt1a and mrt1b. the mrt1 mrnas for mrt1a, mrt1a, and for mrt1b, mrt1b, are predominantly expressed in various brain regions and the testes, respectively. acute map injection upregulated mrt1b expression in the neocortex after postnatal week 3 in a d1 receptor antagonist-sensitive manner without affecting mrt1a expression. this upregulation was mimicked by another stimulant, cocaine, whereas pentobarbital and d1 antagonist failed to change the mrt1b transcript levels. moreover, repeated daily treatment of map, but not map plus d1 antagonist, for 5 days caused an augmentation of the basal expression of mrt1b 2 and 3 weeks after the drug discontinuation. these late-developing, cocaine-crossreactive, d1 antagonist-sensitive and long-term regulations of mrt1b by map are similar to the pharmacological profiles of stimulant-induced behavioral sensitization, and therefore may be associated with the initiation and/or maintenance of the long-term neuronal adaptation.
in vitro evaluation of cytotoxicity and cellular uptake of alternating copolymers for use as drug delivery vehicles this work reports the design of polymer micelles with cross-linked ionic cores that display high stability. block ionomer complexes were utilized as a micellar template for the synthesis of the cross-linked micelles. such micelles represent hydrophilic nanospheres of core-shell morphology. the core comprises a network of the cross-linked polyanions, which is surrounded by the shell of hydrophilic peo chains.
metastatic potential and normal tissues expression of five cathepsins in murine melanomas of varying updated ascitic fluid of patients with primary liver cancer was shown to contain a latent thiol proteinase which can be activated by pepsin treatment or by autolysis at acidic environment. this enzyme resembles cathepsin b (ec 3.4.22.1) in many physical-chemical properties including substrate specificity, requirement for thiol activators and inhibition both by thiol blocking reagents and by peptidyl diazomethyl ketones, but has a higher molecular size even after activation. pepsin treatment and autolysis reduce its mr from 41 800 to 33 400 and 27 700, respectively, but all these forms are larger than human liver cathepsin b. the latent enzyme may be, therefore, an enzyme--inhibitor complex or an inactive precursor of cathepsin b due to an altered processing in golgi endoplasmatic reticulum-lysosome compartment.
expression of piabp19, picdc2 and piserk3 during induction of somatic embryogenesis in leaflets of prunus incisa (thunb.) the first somatic single cells of carrot hypocotyl explants having the competence to form embryos in the presence of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-d) were identified using semi-automatic cell tracking. these competent cells are present as a small subpopulation of enlarged and vacuolated cells derived from cytoplasm-rich and rapidly proliferating non-embryogenic cells that originate from the provascular elements of the hypocotyl. a search for marker genes to monitor the transition of somatic into competent and embryogenic cells in established suspension cell cultures resulted in the identification of a gene transiently expressed in a small subpopulation of the same enlarged single cells that are formed during the initiation of the embryogenic cultures from hypocotyl explants. the predicted amino acid sequence and in vitro kinase assays show that this gene encodes a leucine-rich repeat containing receptor-like kinase protein, designated somatic embryogenesis receptor-like kinase (serk). somatic embryos formed from cells expressing a serk promoter-luciferase reporter gene. during somatic embryogenesis, serk expression ceased after the globular stage. in plants, serk mrna could only be detected transiently in the zygotic embryo up to the early globular stage but not in unpollinated flowers nor in any other plant tissue. these results suggest that somatic cells competent to form embryos and early globular somatic embryos share a highly specific signal transduction chain with the zygotic embryo from shortly after fertilization to the early globular embryo.
mobility has a non-linear association with falls risk among people in residential aged care: an observational study. objectives to assess the use of the voluntary step execution test to identify fallers.   design cross-sectional retrospective.   setting two self-care, residential facilities.   participants a total of 100 healthy old volunteers (mean age = 78.4 +/- 5.7).   measurements the study investigated the use of the voluntary step execution test to identify fallers under single and dual-task conditions. berg balance test (bbs) and timed get up and go (tug) were used to assess balance and gait function.   results there were no significant differences found between fallers and non-fallers in bbs and tug (50.5 +/- 4.6 versus 52.5 +/- 3.4 and 9.4 +/- 3.4 versus 7.98 +/- 2.3 respectively). there were no statistically significant differences between non-fallers and fallers across all step execution parameters under the single-task condition. however, adding cognitive load to the voluntary step execution test revealed statistically significant increases in duration of the preparatory phase, swing time and the time to foot-contact (p = 0.035;p = 0.033 and p = 0.037, respectively). based on the coefficients of the logistic regression model participants with dual-task step execution times of > or =1,100 ms had five times the risk of falling than participants with execution times of <1,100 ms.   conclusions the study provides evidence that a simple, safe measure of step execution under dual-task conditions can identify elderly individuals at risk for falls.
influence of laser irradiation on fiber post retention objective the aim of this study was to compare the antibacterial effectiveness of the nd:yag, the ho:yag, and the er:yag laser in infected root canals.   summary background data lasers are gaining increasing importance in the field of endodontics. numerous studies have shown the beneficial effects of laser treatment in disinfecting root canals.   methods in our in vitro experimental setup, 40 extracted and endodontically treated teeth were inoculated with a suspension of escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis and then irradiated at standardized power settings. the disinfecting efficacy of each laser was proved by classical microbiological examination.   results this article highlights that all three lasers substantially decreased the bacterial population with only minimal differences in their microbicidal efficacy. at 1.5 w, the best results were obtained by the er:yag laser achieving a mean bacterial elimination of 99.64%, followed by the nd:yag laser (99.16%), and the ho:yag laser (99.05%).   conclusion our findings indicate that all three lasers act as strongly effective microbicides without causing unfavorable temperature rises at the settings used. they can thus be considered a valuable tool for root canal treatment.
characteristic differences in modulation of stomatogastric musculature by a neuropeptide in three species of cancer crabs at least 10 different substances modulate the amplitude of nerve-evoked contractions of the gastric mill 4 (gm4) muscle of the crab, cancer borealis. serotonin, dopamine, octopamine, proctolin, red pigment concentrating hormone, crustacean cardioactive peptide, tnrnflrfamide, and sdrnflrfamide increased and -allatostatin-3 and histamine decreased the amplitude of nerve-evoked contractions. modulator efficacy was frequency dependent; tnrnflrfamide, proctolin, and allatostatin-3 were more effective when the motor neuron was stimulated at 10 hz than at 40 hz, whereas the reverse was true for dopamine and serotonin. the modulators that were most effective at high stimulus frequencies produced a significant decrease in muscle relaxation time; those that were most effective at low stimulus frequencies produced modest increases in relaxation time. thus modulator actions that appear redundant when examined only at one stimulus frequency are differentiated when a range of stimulus dynamics is studied. the effects of tnrnflrfamide, serotonin, proctolin, dopamine, and -allatostatin-3 on the amplitude and facilitation of nerve-evoked excitatory junctional potentials (ejps) in the gm4 and gastric mill 6 (gm6) muscles were compared. the ejps in gm4 have a large initial amplitude and show relatively little facilitation, whereas the ejps in gm6 have a small initial amplitude and show considerable facilitation. modulators that enhanced contractions also enhanced ejp amplitude; -allatostatin-3 reduced ejp amplitude. the effects of these modulators on ejp amplitude were modest and showed no significant frequency dependence. this suggests that the frequency dependence of modulator action on contraction results from effects on excitation-contraction coupling. the modulators affected facilitation at these junctions in a manner consistent with a change in release probability. they produced a change in facilitation that is inversely related to their action on ejp amplitude.
environmental lead (pb) exposure versus fatty acid content in blood and milk of the mother and in the blood of newborn children abstract the fatty acid composition of plasma phospholipids, triglycerides, cholesterol esters and nonesterified fatty acids was determined by high-resolution capillary gas-liquid chromatography in 41 pairs of mothers and their term infants at time of birth. the total free fatty acid content in maternal and cord plasma was positively correlated, possibly reflecting a passive, gradient dependent transplacental passage of nonesterified fatty acids. higher percentage values of several saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids in cord than in maternal plasma phospholipids, triglycerides and nonesterified fatty acids may have resulted from an active fetal fatty acid synthesis. trans fatty acids were found in every lipid class at similar or slightly lower percentages in neonatal as in maternal plasma, thus confirming their placental passage. long-chain n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are preferentially incorporated into phospholipids and sterolesters of both maternal and cord plasma. linoleic and α-linolenic acids were found in smaller portions in cord than in maternal fatty acids, in contrast to strikingly higher proportions of their long-chain polyunsaturated metabolites, which may indicate a discriminating placental transport for certain physiologically important long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. conclusion the fetus appears to obtain fatty acids from a combination of de novo synthesis, a passive gradient dependent transplacental passage of nonesterified fatty acids and a selective materno-fetal placental transport for certain fatty acids, such as physiologically important long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.
adolescent gbr12909 exposure induces oxidative stress, disrupts parvalbumin-positive interneurons, and leads to hyperactivity and impulsivity in adult mice antibodies specific for the dopamine transporter (dat) was developed and characterized by immunoblot analysis, immunoprecipitation, and immunocytochemistry, and used for immunolocalization of transporter protein in rat brain at the light microscopic level. antibodies targeting the n-terminus, the second extracellular loop, and the c- terminus were generated from fusion proteins containing amino acid sequences from these respective regions. immunoblot analysis demonstrated that n-terminus and loop antibodies were specific for expressed cloned dat, recognized transporter protein in rat and human striatal membranes, and were sensitive to preabsorption with excess homologous fusion protein. immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that anti-dat antisera recognized solubilized, radiolabeled dat protein in a concentration-dependent manner. dat immunocytochemistry with these antibodies were also sensitive to preabsorption with fusion protein and to lesions of dopaminergic mesostriatal and mesocorticolimbic pathways. regional distribution of dat coincided with established dopaminergic innervation of several regions, including ventral mesencephalon, medial forebrain bundle, and dorsal and ventral striatum. however, certain mismatches between immunocytochemical distributions of dat and tyrosine hydroxylase were apparent, indicating that dopaminergic systems are heterogeneous and may use independent mechanisms for the regulation of dopamine levels in brain. the generation of specific dat antibodies will permit further characterization of the cellular and subcellular localization of dat protein, and of dopaminergic circuits in neurological and psychiatric disorders.
regulation of the number of cell division rounds by tissue-specific transcription factors and cdk inhibitor during ascidian embryogenesis differences in cell responsiveness to an inductive signal contribute to the emergence of a variety of tissue types during animal development. in ascidian embryos, the fibroblast growth factor (fgf) signal secreted from endoderm cells induces several different tissue types, such as notochord, mesenchyme and brain, at different positions in the embryo at the 32-cell stage. we show here in halocynthia roretzi that foxa and zic are required for notochord formation in cells that receive the fgf signal. we also show that these transcription factors, only when both are supplied, are able to induce ectopic expression of the brachyury gene, a notochord-specific marker, in cells of all the three germ layers in an fgf-dependent manner. these results suggest that foxa and zic confer notochord-specific responsiveness to fgf signaling. further analyses including knockdown and over-expression experiments showed that combinatorial inputs from maternally supplied and zigotically activated factors lead to overlapping expression of foxa and zic in the presumptive notochord cells, which eventually activate the expression of the brachyury gene in cooperation with fgf signaling. our data illustrate how a complex gene network specifies the notochord at its specific position within the embryo.
non-linear cross-domain collaborative filtering via hyper-structure transfer recommender systems always aim to provide recommendations for a user based on historical ratings collected from a single domain (e.g., movies or books) only, which may suffer from the data sparsity problem. recently, several recommendation models have been proposed to transfer knowledge by pooling together the rating data from multiple domains to alleviate the sparsity problem, which typically assume that multiple domains share a latent common rating pattern based on the user-item co-clustering. in practice, however, the related domains do not necessarily share such a common rating pattern, and diversity among the related domains might outweigh the advantages of such common pattern, which may result in performance degradations. in this paper, we propose a novel cluster-level based latent factor model to enhance the cross-domain recommendation, which can not only learn the common rating pattern shared across domains with the flexibility in controlling the optimal level of sharing, but also learn the domain-specific rating patterns of users in each domain that involve the discriminative information propitious to performance improvement. to this end, the proposed model is formulated as an optimization problem based on joint nonnegative matrix tri-factorization and an efficient alternating minimization algorithm is developed with convergence guarantee. extensive experiments on several real world datasets suggest that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for the cross-domain recommendation task.
health care providers’ perceptions of and attitudes towards induced abortions in sub-saharan africa and southeast asia: a systematic literature review of qualitative and quantitative data background we assessed whether the safety of first-trimester manual vacuum aspiration abortion done by health-care providers who are not doctors (mid-level providers) is equivalent to that of procedures done by doctors in south africa and vietnam, where mid-level providers are government trained and accredited to do first-trimester abortions.   methods we did a randomised, two-sided controlled equivalence trial to compare rates of complication in abortions done by the two groups of providers. an a-priori margin of equivalence of 4.5% with 80% power and 95% ci (alpha=0.05) was used. 1160 women participated in south africa and 1734 in vietnam. women presenting for an induced abortion at up to 12 weeks' gestation were randomly assigned to a doctor or a mid-level provider for manual vacuum aspiration and followed-up 10-14 days later. the primary outcome was complication of abortion. complications were recorded during the abortion procedure, before discharge from the clinic, and at follow-up. per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses were done. this trial is registered at with the identifier .   findings in both countries, rates of complication satisfied the predetermined statistical criteria for equivalence: rates per 100 patients in south africa were 1.4 (eight of 576) for mid-level providers and 0 for doctors (difference 1.4, 95% ci 0.4 to 2.7); in vietnam, rates were 1.2 (ten of 824) for mid-level providers and 1.2 (ten of 812) for doctors (difference 0.0, 95% ci -1.2 to 1.1). there was one immediate complication related to analgesics. delayed complications were caused by retained products and infection.   interpretation with appropriate government training, mid-level health-care providers can provide first trimester manual vacuum aspiration abortions as safely as doctors can.
meta-analysis of the association between cox-2 polymorphisms and risk of colorectal cancer based on case–control studies in this study, we aimed to investigate a possible association of the cox-2 polymorphisms (−765g→c and −1195a→g) and with the risk of developing epithelial ovarian carcinoma (eoc). cox-2 gene polymorphisms was investigated in 111 healthy women and 57 patients with eoc. individuals who had −765 cg, −1195 aa genotype, and −765 c allele had increased risk for ovarian carcinoma (p < 0.01) and individuals with −765 gg, −1195 ag genotypes and −1195 g allele seem to be protected from ovarian carcinoma (p < 0.01). haplotype analysis confirmed the association of cox-2 gene variants with ovarian carcinoma and revealed that the frequencies of −765c: −1195a haplotype frequencies was significantly higher in patients as compared with those of controls (p = 0.048). we state that there appears to be a modulating role for the cox-2 −1195a→g and −765g→c polymorphisms in the development of eoc. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show such an association.
bacterioplankton abundance and growth in a river-dominated estuary: relationships with temperature and resources the importance of algal and detrital food supplies to the planktonic food web of a highly disturbed, estuarine ecosystem was evaluated in response to declining zooplankton and fish populations. we assessed organic matter bioavailability among a diversity of habitats and hydrologic inputs over 2 years in san francisco estuary's sacramento–san joaquin river delta. results show that bioavailable dissolved organic carbon from external riverine sources supports a large component of ecosystem metabolism. however, bioavailable particulate organic carbon derived primarily from internal phytoplankton production is the dominant food supply to the planktonic food web. the relative importance of phytoplankton as a food source is surprising because phytoplankton production is a small component of the ecosystem's organic-matter mass balance. our results indicate that management plans aimed at modifying the supply of organic matter to riverine, estuarine, and coastal food webs need to incorporate the potentially wide nutritional range represented by different organic matter sources.
statistical track-before-detect methods applied to faint optical observations of resident space objects the objective of multi-object estimation is to simultaneously estimate the number of objects and their states from a set of observations in the presence of data association uncertainty, detection uncertainty, false observations, and noise. this estimation problem can be formulated in a bayesian framework by modeling the (hidden) set of states and set of observations as random finite sets (rfss) that covers thinning, markov shifts, and superposition. a prior for the hidden rfs together with the likelihood of the realization of the observed rfs gives the posterior distribution via the application of bayes rule. we propose a new class of rfs distributions that is conjugate with respect to the multiobject observation likelihood and closed under the chapman-kolmogorov equation. this result is tested on a bayesian multi-target tracking algorithm.
hepatic leukostasis and hypoxic stress in adhesion molecule-deficient mice after gut ischemia/reperfusion. background & aims although it has been reported that gut ischemia/reperfusion (i/r) elicits neutrophil-dependent liver dysfunction, little is known about the kinetics of leukocyte accumulation in the hepatic microcirculation after gut i/r. the aim of this study was to determine the temporal relationship between leukocyte sequestration and oxidative stress in rat liver after occlusion (30 minutes) and reperfusion (60 minutes) of the superior mesenteric artery and assess the effects of neutrophil depletion or immunoneutralization of either intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (icam-1) or the leukocyte adhesion glycoprotein cd11/cd18 on the hepatic microvascular responses to gut i/r.   methods leukocyte accumulation, number of nonperfused sinusoids, and autofluorescence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nadh) were monitored using intravital videomicroscopy both before and after gut i/r.   results the number of adherent leukocytes in both midzonal and pericentral regions after gut i/r was elevated. autofluorescence of nadh increased after reperfusion (indicating hypoxia), particularly in the pericentral region. neutrophil depletion or antibodies to either icam-1 or cd11/cd18 blunted the gut i/r-induced increases in nadh autofluorescence in the pericentral region, leukocyte adherence, and nonperfused sinusoids.   conclusions leukocytes accumulate in the liver after gut i/r via interaction of cd11/cd18 and icam-1. the leukocytes appear to mediate an oxidative stress, occurring in proximity to nonperfused sinusoids, that may contribute to liver injury.
cancer-associated fibroblasts are activated in incipient neoplasia to orchestrate tumor-promoting inflammation in an nf-kappab-dependent manner. we studied the role of nf-κb in acute inflammation caused by gut ischemia-reperfusion through selective ablation of iκb kinase (ikk)-β, the catalytic subunit of ikk that is essential for nf-κb activation. ablation of ikk-β in enterocytes prevented the systemic inflammatory response, which culminates in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (mods) that is normally triggered by gut ischemia-reperfusion. ikk-β removal from enterocytes, however, also resulted in severe apoptotic damage to the reperfused intestinal mucosa. these results show the dual function of the nf-κb system, which is responsible for both tissue protection and systemic inflammation, and underscore the caution that should be exerted in using nf-κb and ikk inhibitors.
role of group ii and iii metabotropic glutamate receptors in rhythmic patterns of the neonatal rat spinal cord in vitro intracellular recording from rat lumbar motoneurones showed that patterned electrical stimulation of one dorsal root induced alternating patterns typical of fictive locomotion, accompanied by a reduction in the antidromic spike afterhyperpolarization (ahp). since the ahp depended linearly on extracellular k(+) ([k(+)](o)), from the ahp fall we calculated that [k(+)](o) rose to 7.9+/-0.4 mm, a value within the 7-10 mm range known to elicit fictive locomotion. to confirm the specificity of this approach we also tested concentrations of n-methyl-d-aspartate (2 microm) below threshold for fictive locomotion, and we observed that, despite strong excitation, the estimated [k(+)](o) was 6 mm, i.e. outside the range for fictive locomotion. we suggest that synaptic activity induced by a certain pattern of electrical stimulation of afferent fibres evoked persistent elevation in [k(+)](o) which triggered the locomotor network to generate rhythmic patterns.
two newly identified sites in the n-terminal regulatory domain of aurora-a are essential for auto-inhibition aurora-a is a centrosome-localized serine/threonine kinase that is overexpressed in multiple human cancers. here, we report an intramolecular inhibitory regulation in aurora-a between its n-terminal regulatory domain (aa 1-128, nt) and the c-terminal catalytic domain (aa 129-403, cd). removal of nt results in a significant increase in kinase activity. nt inhibited the activity of the single c-terminal kinase domain, but had little effect on the activity of the full-length of aurora-a. pp1 is not involved in this regulation, instead, nt interacts cd directly in vitro and in vivo. the non-aurora box (aa 64-128) in the n-terminal negatively regulated the kinase activity of the c-terminal kinase domain by intramolecular interaction with aa 240-300 within the c-terminal.
mondo/chrebp-mlx-regulated transcriptional network is essential for dietary sugar tolerance in drosophila the paralogous transcription factors chrebp and mondoa, together with their common binding partner mlx, have emerged as key mediators of intracellular glucose sensing. by regulating target genes involved in glycolysis and lipogenesis, they mediate metabolic adaptation to changing glucose levels. as disturbed glucose homeostasis plays a central role in human metabolic diseases and as cancer cells often display altered glucose metabolism, better understanding of cellular glucose sensing will likely uncover new therapeutic opportunities. here we review the regulation, function and evolutionary conservation of the chrebp/mondoa-mlx glucose sensing system and discuss possible directions for future research.
anti-cancer effects of aloe-emodin: a systematic review aloe-emodin (1,8-dihydroxy-3-(hydroxymethyl)-anthraquinone) is an active component from the root and rhizome of rheum palmatum. the study investigated the effects and mechanisms of aloe-emodin-induced cell death in human lung squamous cell carcinoma cell line ch27. aloe-emodin (40 microm)-induced ch27 cell apoptosis was confirmed by dna fragmentation (dna ladders and sub-g(1) formation). aloe-emodin-induced apoptosis of ch27 cells involved modulation of the expression of bcl-2 family proteins, such as bclx(l), bag-1, and bak, and was associated with the translocation of bak and bax from cytosolic to particulate fractions. aloe-emodin-treated ch27 cells had an increased relative abundance of cytochrome c in the cytosolic fraction. results demonstrated that the activation of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 is an important determinant of apoptotic death induced by aloe-emodin. these results suggest that aloe-emodin induces ch27 cell death by the bax and fas death pathway.
the cghaa1-regulon mediates response and tolerance to acetic acid stress in the human pathogen candida glabrata saccharomyces cerevisiae has a single integral plasma membrane heat shock protein (hsp). this hsp30 is induced by several stresses, including heat shock, ethanol exposure, severe osmostress, weak organic acid exposure and glucose limitation. plasma membrane h(+)-atpase activities of heat shocked and weak acid-adapted, hsp30 mutant and wild-type cells, revealed that hsp30 induction leads to a downregulation of the stress-stimulation of this h(+)-atpase. plasma membrane h(+)-atpase activity consumes a substantial fraction of the atp generated by the cell, a usage that will be increased by the h(+)-atpase stimulation occurring with several hsp30-inducing stresses. hsp30 might therefore provide an energy conservation role, limiting excessive atp consumption by plasma membrane h(+)-atpase during prolonged stress exposure or glucose limitation. consistent with the role of hsp30 being energy conservation, hsp30 null cultures give lower final biomass yields. they also have lower atp levels, consistent with higher h(+)-atpase activity, at the glucose exhaustion stage of batch fermentations (diauxic lag), when hsp30 is normally induced. loss of hsp30 does not affect several stress tolerances but it extends the time needed for cells to adapt to growth under several stressful conditions where the maintenance of homeostasis will demand an unusually high usage of energy, hsp30 is the first yeast gene identified as both weak organic acid-inducible and assisting the adaptation to growth in the presence of these acids.
chlamydial type iii secretion system needle protein induces protective immunity against chlamydia muridarum intravaginal infection chlamydia trachomatis sexually transmitted infections cause considerable morbidity and socioeconomic burden worldwide, despite significant advances in our understanding of the biology (29, 31, 57), pathogenesis (11, 83, 117), genomics (94), and epidemiology (91) of this parasite. chlamydial urogenital tract infections are readily cured with antibiotics, but control measures based on antimicrobial chemotherapy alone are hampered by the frequency of asymptomatic infections and delayed diagnosis (9). definitive control of c. trachomatis sexually transmitted diseases (stds) is possible through the development of a safe and efficacious vaccine (24). progress toward the development of an effective vaccine has been disappointingly modest, as it has been for vaccines to other sexually transmitted pathogens that infect the genital tract mucosae. the strict tropism for mucosal epithelial cells, the complex biology and antigenic structure, and the predilection to cause persistent infection have presented formidable challenges to chlamydial vaccine development. a heightened understanding of protective immunity to c. trachomatis urogenital infection has emerged in the past decade from studies using a mouse model of chlamydial genital tract infection. the insights are of considerable interest because they offer promise for the development of an efficacious chlamydial vaccine. this review focuses on that progress and summarizes the current understanding of protective immune mechanisms that function against murine chlamydial urogenital infection. we also discuss specific requirements for a vaccine to protect against chlamydial stds and the challenges presently confronting us in achieving that goal.
activity and expression of ecto-5′-nucleotidase/cd73 are increased by thyroid hormones in vascular smooth muscle cells sympathetically innervated smooth muscles, including those in some arteries, arterioles, cat nictitating membrane and vas deferens, have α 1 -adrenoceptors which respond to exogenously applied noradrenaline (na) by producing contractions which can be abolished by α 1 -adrenoceptor antagonists such as prazosin. stimulation of the sympathetic nerves innervating these muscles causes release of na and a contractile response. however, this contraction is (at least partly) resistant to specific α 1 -adrenoceptor antagonists. this apparent contradiction could be explained by a variety of ad hoc explanations (such as high transmitter concentrations within the nerve-muscle junction, or prejunctional enhancement of transmitter release by the antagonist due to prejunctional α 2 -adrenoceptor blockade etc.) but recently two hypotheses have been advanced which may have more fundamental implications for sympathetic neurotransmission. first, hirst and neild and their colleagues suggested that the electrical and mechanical responses of some smooth muscles were resistant to α-adrenoceptor antagonists because neuronally released na was acting not only on α-adrenoceptors but also on a new class of adrenoceptors which they designated γ-receptors, located near the nerve-muscle junction. the crucial experiments in support of this hypothesis were originally performed on the arterioles of the guinea-pig submucosa [1], but the idea has been extended to include many other sympathetically innervated smooth muscles [2], including guinea-pig vas deferens, which was also the smooth muscle preparation in which the experimental evidence for an alternative hypothesis was obtained by fedan et al. [3]. they proposed that the α-blocker-resistant portion of the contractile response to sympathetic nerve stimulation was mediated by atp, acting as a cotransmitter with na. full details of the early development of the concept of cotransmission in sympathetic nerves have been reviewed previously [4, 6, 7]. the experimental evidence relating to the co-transmission hypothesis is outlined below, drawing mainly on results obtained in guinea-pig vas deferens, where most of the more recent experiments have been performed.
overcoming heterologous protein interdependency to optimize p450-mediated taxol precursor synthesis in escherichia coli protein engineering of cytochrome p450 monooxygenases (p450s) has been very successful in generating valuable non-natural activities and properties, allowing these powerful catalysts to be used for the synthesis of drug metabolites and in biosynthetic pathways for the production of precursors of artemisinin and paclitaxel. collected experience indicates that the p450s are highly 'evolvable' - they are particularly robust to mutation in their active sites and readily accept new substrates and exhibit new selectivities. their ability to adapt to new challenges upon mutation may reflect the nonpolar nature of their active sites as well as their high degree of conformational variability.
the role of portal vein embolization in the surgical management of primary hepatobiliary cancers. a systematic review. the aim of this study is to identify the efficacy of portal vein embolization (pve) before right hepatectomy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) with regard to hepatic function, surgical stress, and survival benefit.
nf‐κb and androgen receptor variant expression correlate with human bph progression the metabolic syndrome is common in countries with western lifestyles. it comprises a number of disorders—including insulin resistance, hypertension and obesity—that all act as risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. urological diseases have also been linked to the metabolic syndrome. most established aspects of the metabolic syndrome are linked to benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) and prostate cancer. fasting plasma insulin, in particular, has been linked to bph and incident, aggressive and lethal prostate cancer. the metabolic syndrome has also been shown to be associated with nonprostatic urological conditions such as male hypogonadism, nephrolithiasis, overactive bladder and erectile dysfunction, although data on these conditions are still sparse. overall, the results of studies on urological aspects of the metabolic syndrome seem to indicate that bph and prostate cancer could be regarded as two new aspects of the metabolic syndrome, and that an increased insulin level is a common underlying aberration that promotes both bph and clinical prostate cancer. urologists need to be aware of the effect that the metabolic syndrome has on urological disorders and should transfer this knowledge to their patients.
expression profile of androgen-modulated micrornas in the fetal murine lung aberrant wnt signalling promotes oncogenesis by increasing the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin to activate downstream target genes. however, the mechanism of β-catenin recruitment to the wnt target-gene promoter, a critical step for removing the co-repressor complex, is largely unknown. here, we report that transducin β-like protein 1 (tbl1) and its highly related family member tblr1 were required for wnt–β-catenin-mediated transcription. wnt signalling induced the interaction between β-catenin and tbl1–tblr1, as well as their binding to wnt target genes. importantly, the recruitment of tbl1–tblr1 and β-catenin to wnt target-gene promoters was mutually dependent on each other. furthermore, the depletion of tbl1–tblr1 significantly inhibited wnt–β-catenin-induced gene expression and oncogenic growth in vitro and in vivo. our results unravel two new components required for nuclear β-catenin function, and have important implications in developing new strategies for inhibiting wnt–β-catenin-mediated tumorigenesis.
convergent actions of iκb kinase β and protein kinase cδ modulate mrna stability through phosphorylation of 14-3-3β complexed with tristetraprolin tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf alpha) is a multifunctional cytokine belonging to a family of ligands with an associated family of receptor proteins. the pleiotropic actions of tnf range from proliferative responses such as cell growth and differentiation, to inflammatory effects and the mediation of immune responses, to destructive cellular outcomes such as apoptotic and necrotic cell death mechanisms. activated tnf receptors mediate the association of distinct adaptor proteins that regulate a variety of signalling processes including kinase or phosphatase activation, lipase stimulation, and protease induction. moreover, the cytokine regulates the activities of transcription factors, heterotrimeric or monomeric g-proteins and calcium ion homeostasis in order to orchestrate its cellular functions. this review addresses the structural basis of tnf signalling, the pathways employed with their cellular consequences, and focuses on the specific role played by each of the two tnf receptor isotypes, tnfr1 and tnfr2.
nuclear structures surrounding internal lamin invaginations the specificity of eukaryotic dna organization into loops fixed to the nuclear matrix/chromosomal scaffold has been studied for more than fifteen years. the results and conclusions of different authors remain, however, controversial. recently, we have elaborated a new approach to the study of chromosomal dna loops. instead of characterizing loop basements (nuclear matrix dna), we have concentrated our efforts on the characterization of individual loops after their excision by dna topoisomerase ii‐mediated dna cleavage at matrix attachment sites. in this review the results of applying this mapping approach are compared with the results and conclusions from studies of nuclear matrix dna. an attempt is also made to reconsider all data about the specificity of dna interactions with the nuclear matrix and to suggest a model of spatial organization of the eukaryotic genome which resolves apparent contradictions between these data.
relationship between vitamin d receptor bsmi and foki polymorphisms and anthropometric and biochemical parameters describing metabolic syndrome vitamin d receptor (vdr) polymorphism influences susceptibility to type 1 diabetes, but the association with type 2 diabetes is not clear. we investigated the association between vdr polymorphism and type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome in a community-based study of unrelated older adults without known diabetes. oral glucose tolerance test (75 g), plasma glucose and insulin measurement, homeostasis model assessment (homa), and vdr genotyping were performed. the distributions of genotype frequencies of apai, bsmi, and taqi polymorphism did not differ between persons with and without diabetes, but the frequency of aa genotype of apai polymorphism was marginally higher in persons with type 2 diabetes (p =.058). fasting plasma glucose (p <.05) and prevalence of glucose intolerance (p <.05) were significantly higher in nondiabetic persons with aa genotype compared with those with aa genotype. the bb genotype of bsmi polymorphism was associated with insulin resistance as assessed by homa after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index (bmi), and calcium and vitamin d use in persons without diabetes (p <.05). our research suggests that apai polymorphism may be associated with glucose intolerance independent of defective insulin secretion and bsmi polymorphism with insulin resistance in a nondiabetic caucasian population.
construction and characterization of a clostripain-like protease-deficient mutant of clostridium perfringens as a strain for clostridial gene expression aims:  to explore the potential to enhance secretion of heterologous proteins in bacillus subtilis by engineering cell factors affecting extracytoplasmic protein folding and degradation.
group a streptococcal puerperal sepsis: initial characterization of virulence factors in association with clinical parameters. analysis of 132 group a streptococcal (gas) isolates from 151 invasive episodes, including streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (stss), from 1983 to 1995 showed great genetic variation by use of t serotyping in combination with restriction fragment length polymorphism. in contrast, genetically homogenous t1m1 isolates appeared in epidemic patterns with significantly increased risk of stss. the spea gene, with the allelic variants spea2 and spea3 carried by the t1m1 and t3m3 serotypes, respectively, was strongly associated with stss. infection with a gas isolate carrying spea, alcohol abuse, and malignancy recently treated with cytostatic drugs were factors independently related to stss. neutralization of spea lymphocyte mitogenicity was totally absent in sera from patients with stss and low in sera from persons with uncomplicated bacteremia compared with levels in sera from uncomplicated erysipelas. neutralization of speb was significantly lower in sera of patients with stss than in sera from persons with bacteremia or erysipelas.
evaluation of post-operative complications associated with repeat resection and bcnu wafer implantation in recurrent glioblastoma summaryfollowing the resection of newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastomas, local implantation of carmustine-impregnated biodegradable wafers (gliadel®) in the resection cavity constitutes an adjuvant therapy that can improve the possibilities of survival. however, some precautions should be taken regarding gliadel implantation. we report three cases in whom patients with glioblastoma multiforme were implanted with fibrin glue-secured gliadel after the lateral ventricles had been opened, and who later developed severe hydrocephalus leading to death. although gliadel may be an important adjunct to treatment, opening of the ventricles during surgery as part of its application should be considered a contra-indication.
probabilistic reinforcement learning in adults with autism spectrum disorders we used event-related fmri to identify the brain regions engaged during explicit and implicit sequence learning (esl and isl, respectively). twenty-four subjects performed a concurrent esl and isl task. behavior showed learning in both conditions. prefrontal (pfc), striatal, anterior cingulate cortex (acc) and visual regions (v1, v2 and v3) were engaged during both esl and isl. with esl there was increased activity in the visual regions on the predictable (i.e. learned pattern) trials. with isl, however, there was a relative decrease in activity in visual regions. the opposite patterns in the visual regions highlight the different effects of esl and isl. the learning process was distinguished from the result of learning, by fitting subjects' functional magnetic resonance imaging data to their learning curve. this analysis revealed more extensive pfc activity during esl and caudal acc activity specific for the result of learning analysis, when the expected response was violated. our results suggest a relative dissociation of the brain regions engaged during esl and isl, whereby esl and isl can be viewed as partially distinct but overlapping parallel processes.
prevalence and optimal management strategy for aortic regurgitation in tetralogy of fallot. five patients with tetralogy of fallot associated with aortic insufficiency were studied. they ranged from 6 to 34 years old (mean, 14 years), and 2 patients had a history of subacute bacterial endocarditis. four patients had a bulboventricular type of ventricular septal defect. prolapse of the right coronary cusp was the main cause of aortic insufficiency. deformed valve secondary to subacute bacterial endocarditis and severe dilatation of the aortic annulus were the other causes. in addition to repair of the tetralogy defect, aortic valvuloplasty was performed in 2 patients. in the remaining 3 patients, the ventricular septal defect was closed with a relatively small-sized patch and no aortotomy was made. four patients survived the operation, and no residual aortic insufficiency was observed in 3 of them. the etiology and the method of operation are discussed.
characteristics of in‐vitro phenotypes of glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 autoantibodies in high‐titre individuals background stiff-person syndrome (sps) is an immune-mediated central nervous system disorder characterized by fluctuating muscle stiffness, disabling spasms, and heightened sensitivity to external stimuli. up to 80% of patients with sps have anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (gad) antibodies in the serum or cerebral spinal fluid (csf). whether these antibodies are clinically relevant and correlate with disease severity is unknown.   objective to correlate anti-gad antibody titers in the serum and csf of patients with sps with the degree of clinical severity.   design patients studied the last 6 years.   setting the clinical center of the national institutes of health, bethesda, md.   patients sixteen patients with typical sps and elevated serum anti-gad antibody titers.   interventions antibody titers in serum and csf were measured by radioimmunoassay, and the intrathecal anti-gad-specific igg production was calculated.   main outcome measures comparison of antibody titers with stiffness index and heightened sensitivity scores based on scales that reliably measure disease severity.   results the mean disease duration was 11 years (range, 5-30 years). the mean anti-gad antibody titer in the serum was 51 500 u/ml (range, 24 000-200 000 u/ml); and in the csf, 181 u/ml (range, 30-400 u/ml). a 10-fold increased intrathecal production of gad-specific igg antibodies was noted. no correlation was found between antibody titers in serum or csf with disease severity. in 4 patients, the anti-gad antibody titers measured serially during a 2-year period did not correlate with clinical fluctuations.   conclusions in patients with sps, the anti-gad antibody titers in serum and csf do not correlate with disease severity or duration. anti-gad antibodies are an excellent marker for sps, but monitoring their titers during the course of the disease may not be of practical value.
late neoproterozoic dokhan volcanics, north eastern desert, egypt: geochemistry and petrogenesis willis, k.m., stern, r.j. and clauer, n., 1988. age and geochemistry of late precambrian sediments of the hammamat series from the northeastern desert of egypt. precambrian res., 42: 173-187. late precambrian crustal evolution in the northeastern desert of egypt culminated in a major episode of strong extension, accompanied by bimodal igneous activity and deposition of clastic sediments in restricted terrigenous basins. these sediments, known as the hammamat series, record the uncovering of the evolving crust of the region. we have undertaken petrographic, geochemical, and rb-sr and k-ar geochronologic studies of hammamat samples collected along a single traverse. the lower half of a 400 m thick section consists of coarse detritus shed from nearby ensimatic terranes, while the upper half was derived from rapid reworking of bimodal igneous rocks similar to those of the dokhan volcanics and pink granites, units that are preserved within the region. rb-sr whole-rock analyses give an 8-point isochron age of 585 +_ 15 ma with an initial stsr/~sr of 0.70323 ± 0.00013, interpreted to approximate closely the time of sedimentation. this is very similar to the k-ar ages of the coarser clay fractions (2-0.5 #m) (588-567 ma). this result is consistent with stratigraphic considerations and other geochronological studies indicating that hammamat deposition occurred at ~ 590 ma. rb-sr analyses of leached and unleached size fractions indicate thermal resetting at 524 +_ 17 ma accompanied or followed by fluxing of a radiogenic sr-rich pore fluid (stsr/s~sr =0.7124). this is further indicated by k-ar ages of the 0.2-0.5 ttm size fraction of 542-532 ma.
nociceptor-expressed ephrin-b2 regulates inflammatory and neuropathic pain the maintenance of bone homeostasis is tightly controlled, and largely dependent upon cellular communication between osteoclasts and osteoblasts, and the coupling of bone resorption to bone formation. this tight coupling is essential for the correct function and maintenance of the skeletal system, repairing microscopic skeletal damage and replacing aged bone. a range of pathologic diseases, including osteoporosis and cancer-induced bone disease, disrupt this coupling and cause subsequent alterations in bone homeostasis. eph receptors and their associated ligands, ephrins, play critical roles in a number of cellular processes including immune regulation, neuronal development and cancer metastasis. eph receptors are also expressed by cells found within the bone marrow microenvironment, including osteoclasts and osteoblasts, and there is increasing evidence to implicate this family of receptors in the control of normal and pathological bone remodeling.
intrinsic laryngeal muscle activity in response to autonomic nervous system activation background in companion studies on canine and rodent laryngeal muscle, we observed that (1) muscle fibers in both the canine and rodent posterior cricoarytenoid (pca) muscles have a slower myosin heavy-chain (myhc) isoform profile than those in the thyroarytenoid (ta) muscle; (2) the muscle fiber composition of pca and ta muscles in canines and rodents is complex given the presence of so-called hybrid fibers (fibers coexpressing various combinations of myhc isoforms); (3) the types and proportions of hybrid fibers are both muscle specific and, in some cases, region specific; and (4) the myhc isoform profile of canine laryngeal muscle appears to be slower than that of rodent laryngeal muscle, suggesting the possibility that larger mammals have a slower myhc isoform profile.   objectives given the findings of these companion studies and the fact that very little is known about the myhc isoform composition of laryngeal muscle fibers, the primary objectives of this study were to determine (1) the types of myhc isoforms found in the human pca and ta muscles, (2) if there were regional differences in myhc isoform composition, (3) if hybrid fibers commonly occur in human laryngeal muscle, and (4) if the myhc isoform profile of human laryngeal muscle is slower than that of canine and rodent laryngeal muscle.   results and conclusions the findings of this study clearly demonstrate that both the pca and ta muscles in humans express 3 types of myhc isoforms (ie, slow type i, fast type iia, and fast type iix myhc isoforms). at the single-fiber level, there were distinct regional differences and hybrid fibers were a common occurrence. finally, the data demonstrate that the pca and ta muscles of humans have a slower myhc profile than that found in either canine or rodent laryngeal muscle.
deletion of irs2 reduces amyloid deposition and rescues behavioural deficits in app transgenic mice alzheimer's disease (ad) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the deposition of amyloid β-peptide (a-beta) in the brain. transthyretin (ttr) is a tetrameric protein of about 55 kda mainly produced in the liver and choroid plexus of the brain. the known physiological functions of ttr are the transport of thyroid hormone t4 and retinol, through binding to the retinol binding protein. ttr has also been established as a cryptic protease able to cleave apoa-i in vitro. it has been described that ttr is involved in preventing a-beta fibrilization, both by inhibiting and disrupting a-beta fibrils, with consequent abrogation of toxicity. we further characterized the nature of the ttr/a-beta interaction and found that ttr, both recombinant or isolated from human sera, was able to proteolytically process a-beta, cleaving the peptide after aminoacid residues 1, 2, 3, 10, 13, 14,16, 19 and 27, as determined by mass spectrometry, and reversed phase chromatography followed by n-terminal sequencing. a-beta peptides (1–14) and (15–42) showed lower amyloidogenic potential than the full length counterpart, as assessed by thioflavin binding assay and ultrastructural analysis by transmission electron microscopy. a-beta cleavage by ttr was inhibited in the presence of an αapp peptide containing the kunitz protease inhibitor (kpi) domain but not in the presence of the secreted αapp derived from the app isoform 695 without the kpi domain. ttr was also able to degrade aggregated forms of a-beta peptide. our results confirmed ttr as a protective molecule in ad, and prompted a-beta proteolysis by ttr as a protective mechanism in this disease. ttr may prove to be a useful therapeutic agent for preventing or retarding the cerebral amyloid plaque formation implicated in ad pathology.
ets-1 is a transcriptional mediator of oncogenic nitric oxide signaling in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer no produced in tumors can either positively or negatively regulate growth. to examine this dichotomy, effects of no concentration and duration on the posttranslational regulation of several key proteins were examined in human breast mcf7 cells under aerobic conditions. we found that different concentration thresholds of no appear to elicit a discrete set of signal transduction pathways. at low steady-state concentrations of no (<50 nm), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) phosphorylation was induced via a guanylate cyclase-dependent mechanism. hypoxic inducible factor 1α (hif-1α) accumulation was associated with an intermediate amount of no (>100 nm), whereas p53 serine 15 phosphorylation occurred at considerably higher levels (>300 nm). erk phosphorylation was transient during no exposure. hif-1α stabilization paralleled the presence of no, whereas p53 serine 15 phosphorylation was detected during, and persisted after, no exposure. the dose-dependent effects of synthetic no donors were mimicked by activated macrophages cocultured with mcf7 cells at varying ratios. erk and hif-1α activation was similar in breast cancer cell lines either mutant (mb231) or null (mb157) in p53. the stabilization of hif-1α by no was not observed with increased mcf7 cell density, demonstrating the interrelationship between no and o2 consumption. the findings show that concentration and duration of no exposure are critical determinants in the regulation of tumor-related proteins.
bayesian spatial quantile regression with scientific data available at geocoded locations, investigators are increasingly turning to spatial process models for carrying out statistical inference. over the last decade, hierarchical models implemented through markov chain monte carlo methods have become especially popular for spatial modelling, given their flexibility and power to fit models that would be infeasible with classical methods as well as their avoidance of possibly inappropriate asymptotics. however, fitting hierarchical spatial models often involves expensive matrix decompositions whose computational complexity increases in cubic order with the number of spatial locations, rendering such models infeasible for large spatial data sets. this computational burden is exacerbated in multivariate settings with several spatially dependent response variables. it is also aggravated when data are collected at frequent time points and spatiotemporal process models are used. with regard to this challenge, our contribution is to work with what we call predictive process models for spatial and spatiotemporal data. every spatial (or spatiotemporal) process induces a predictive process model (in fact, arbitrarily many of them). the latter models project process realizations of the former to a lower dimensional subspace, thereby reducing the computational burden. hence, we achieve the flexibility to accommodate non-stationary, non-gaussian, possibly multivariate, possibly spatiotemporal processes in the context of large data sets. we discuss attractive theoretical properties of these predictive processes. we also provide a computational template encompassing these diverse settings. finally, we illustrate the approach with simulated and real data sets.
a chrna5 smoking risk variant decreases the aversive effects of nicotine in humans objectiveallelic variation in the α5 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nachr) subunit gene, chrna5, increases vulnerability to tobacco addiction. here, we investigated the role of α5* nachrs in the effects of nicotine on brain reward systems.materials and methodseffects of acute (0.03125–0.5 mg/kg sc) or chronic (24 mg/kg per day; osmotic minipump) nicotine and mecamylamine-precipitated withdrawal on intracranial self-stimulation (icss) thresholds were assessed in wild-type and α5 nachr subunit knockout mice. noxious effects of nicotine were further investigated using a conditioned taste aversion procedure.resultslower nicotine doses (0.03125–0.125 mg/kg) decreased icss thresholds in wild-type and α5 knockout mice. at higher doses (0.25–0.5 mg/kg), threshold-lowering effects of nicotine were diminished in wild-type mice, whereas nicotine lowered thresholds across all doses tested in α5 knockout mice. nicotine (1.5 mg/kg) conditioned a taste aversion to saccharine equally in both genotypes. mecamylamine (5 mg/kg) elevated icss thresholds by a similar magnitude in wild-type and α5 knockout mice prepared with minipumps delivering nicotine. unexpectedly, mecamylamine also elevated thresholds in saline-treated α5 knockout mice.conclusionα5* nachrs are not involved in reward-enhancing effects of lower nicotine doses, the reward-inhibiting effects of nicotine withdrawal, or the general noxious effects of higher nicotine doses. instead, α5* nachrs regulate the reward-inhibiting effects nicotine doses that oppose the reward-facilitating effects of the drug. these data suggest that disruption of α5* nachr signaling greatly expands the range of nicotine doses that facilitate brain reward activity, which may help explain the increased tobacco addiction vulnerability associated with chrna5 risk alleles.
a technique for high-throughput protein crystallization in ionically cross-linked polysaccharide gel beads for x-ray diffraction experiments the introduction of electrostatic layer-by-layer (lbl) self-assembly has shown broad biomedical applications in thin film coating, micropatterning, nanobioreactors, artificial cells, and drug delivery systems. multiple assembly polyelectrolytes and proteins are based on electrostatic interaction between oppositely charged layers. the film architecture is precisely designed and can be controlled to 1-nm precision with a range from 5 to 1000 nm. thin films can be deposited on any surface including many widely used biomaterials. microencapsulation of micro/nanotemplates with multilayers enabled cell surface modification, controlled drug release, hollow shell formation, and nanobioreactors. both in vitro and in vivo studies indicate potential applications in biology, pharmaceutics, medicine, and other biomedical areas.
the ca2+ channel inhibitor 2‐apb reverses β‐amyloid‐induced ltp deficit in hippocampus by blocking bax and caspase‐3 hyperactivation beta amyloid (abeta), a peptide generated from the amyloid precursor protein (app) by neurons, is widely believed to underlie the pathophysiology of alzheimer's disease. recent studies indicate that this peptide can drive loss of surface ampa and nmda type glutamate receptors. we now show that abeta employs signaling pathways of long-term depression (ltd) to drive endocytosis of synaptic ampa receptors. synaptic removal of ampa receptors is necessary and sufficient to produce loss of dendritic spines and synaptic nmda responses. our studies indicate the central role played by ampa receptor trafficking in abeta-induced modification of synaptic structure and function.
comparison of endodontic retreatment in teeth obturated with resilon or gutta-percha: a review of literature objective retreatment of a root canal in the case of infection requires complete removal of previous filling material. this study evaluated the efficacy of 3 techniques in removing laterally compacted resilon/epiphany and gutta-percha/ah plus from straight and curved canals during retreatment.   materials and methods extracted human teeth (90 maxillary anterior teeth with single,straight root canals and 90 mandibular molars with mesial canal root curvatures of 20 degrees to 35 degrees ) were divided into 6 groups each consisting of 15 straight and 15 curved root canals. three groups were obturated using gutta-percha/ah plus and 3 were obturated with resilon/epiphany. after 3 weeks storage at 37 degrees c and 100% humidity, all root canal fillings were removed using a gates glidden drill, a gates glidden drill plus chloroform or a system b device.   results for all removal techniques, specimens obturated with gutta-percha/ah plus showed significantly more remnants of obturation material than specimens filled with resilon/epiphany for both straight and curved canals (p < 0.05). removal time was shorter for resilon/epiphany than gutta-percha/ah plus filling for all techniques and for both curved and straight canals. the gates glidden drill and gates glidden drill plus chloroform removal techniques were significantly faster than the system b technique for both straight and curved canals. the gates glidden drill technique was best for straight canals, whereas the gates glidden drill plus chloroform was the best technique for curved canals when removing resilon/epiphany sealer.   conclusions removal of resilon/epiphany filling resulted in fewer remnants and was faster than gutta-percha/ah plus removal using a gates glidden drill with or without chloroform in both straight and curved canals.
relationship of the changes of cervical mri, tcd and baep in patients with "isolated" vertigo. abstract objectives: vertigo can be a manifestation of underlying vertebrobasilar stroke in older adults. the study objectives were to investigate the correlation, sensitivity, and specificity of the auditory brainstem response (abr), electronystagmorgraphy (eng), and transcranial doppler (tcd) collectively to distinguish between vertigo due to vertebrobasilar insufficiency (vbi) and vertigo due to non-vbi. design: prospective experimental study comparing eng, abr, and tcd battery findings between two groups of patients with vertigo and a control group. study sample: participants included 14 patients with vertigo of vbi origin, 14 patients with vertigo of non-vbi, and 11 matched controls. results: participants with vbi had more abnormal findings in the eng (86%), tcd (72%), and abr (64%) compared to the non-vbi group (64%, 21%, and 7%, respectively) and the control group. the combined battery revealed positive correlations, 64% sensitivity, and 84% positive predictive value (ppv) in the vbi group, and 100% specificity with lack of correlations in the non-vbi group. conclusions: the modest sensitivity and ppv helps with early detection of vbi, thus preventing risk of vertebrobasilar stroke in 84% to 64% of patients. the 100% specificity in the non-vbi group rules out vbi, thus reducing the referral rate for unnecessary, diagnostic evaluations and ineffective treatment.
autophosphorylation of ataxia‐telangiectasia mutated is regulated by protein phosphatase 2a dna-dependent protein kinase (dna-pk) is a complex of dna-pk catalytic subunit (dna-pkcs) and the dna end-binding ku70/ku80 heterodimer. dna-pk is required for dna double strand break repair by the process of nonhomologous end joining. nonhomologous end joining is a major mechanism for the repair of dna double strand breaks in mammalian cells. as such, dna-pk plays essential roles in the cellular response to ionizing radiation and in v(d)j recombination. in vitro, dna-pk undergoes phosphorylation of all three protein subunits (dna-pk catalytic subunit, ku70 and ku80) and phosphorylation correlates with inactivation of the serine/threonine protein kinase activity of dna-pk. here we show that phosphorylation-induced loss of the protein kinase activity of dna-pk is restored by the addition of the purified catalytic subunit of either protein phosphatase 1 or protein phosphatase 2a (pp2a) and that this reactivation is blocked by the potent protein phosphatase inhibitor, microcystin. we also show that treating human lymphoblastoid cells with either okadaic acid or fostriecin, at pp2a-selective concentrations, causes a 50–60% decrease in dna-pk protein kinase activity, although the protein phosphatase 1 activity in these cells was unaffected. in vivo phosphorylation of dna-pkcs, ku70, and ku80 was observed when cells were labeled with [32p]inorganic phosphate in the presence of the protein phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid. together, our data suggest that reversible protein phosphorylation is an important mechanism for the regulation of dna-pk protein kinase activity and that the protein phosphatase responsible for reactivation in vivo is a pp2a-like enzyme.
computer-aided designed, three dimensional-printed hemipelvic prosthesis for peri-acetabular malignant bone tumour five children with pelvic ewing's sarcoma whose age was 6-10 years underwent reconstruction after resection of the tumor. one child with a tumor of the ilium underwent an iliosacral arthrodesis with allograft. three patients underwent a hip transposition after the resection of the ilium and the upper part of the acetabulum. one patient underwent no skeletal reconstruction after the resection of the acetabulum and the ilium. two children are alive 96 and 60 months after surgery; however, two died 12 and 21 months after surgery of metastasis, and one is alive with metastasis 15 months after surgery. functional evaluation was possible in four patients: one is excellent, and three are fair. after resection of the ilium, including the upper part of the acetabulum, a hip transposition can be selected. if all the acetabulum is resected, it will be optimal not to do a bony reconstruction.
kinetics of cellobiohydrolase ( cel 7 a ) variants with lowered substrate despite intensive research, the mechanism of the rapid retardation in the rates of cellobiohydrolase (cbh) catalyzed cellulose hydrolysis is still not clear. interpretation of the hydrolysis data has been complicated by the inability to measure the catalytic constants for cbh‐s acting on cellulose. we developed a method for measuring the observed catalytic constant (kobs) for cbh catalyzed cellulose hydrolysis. it relies on in situ measurement of the concentration of cbh with the active site occupied by the cellulose chain. for that we followed the specific inhibition of the hydrolysis of para‐nitrophenyl‐β‐d‐lactoside by cellulose. the method was applied to cbh‐s trcel7a from trichoderma reesei and pccel7d from phanerochaete chrysosporium and their isolated catalytic domains. bacterial microcrystalline cellulose, avicel, amorphous cellulose, and lignocellulose were used as substrates. a rapid decrease of kobs in time was observed on all substrates. the kobs values for pccel7d were about 1.5 times higher than those for trcel7a. in case of both trcel7a and pccel7d, the kobs values for catalytic domains were similar to those for intact enzymes. a model where cbh action is limited by the average length of obstacle‐free way on cellulose chain is proposed. once formed, productive cbh–cellulose complex proceeds with a constant rate determined by the true catalytic constant. after encountering an obstacle cbh will “get stuck” and the rate of further cellulose hydrolysis will be governed by the dissociation rate constant (koff), which is low for processive cbh‐s. biotechnol. bioeng. 2010;106: 871–883. © 2010 wiley periodicals, inc.
childhood autism and auditory system abnormalities. the structure of the planum temporale is often disturbed in disorders with associated communication problems, particularly in auditory and language processing areas in the brain. we hypothesized that people with autism would have reduced left hemisphere volumes in the planum temporale, a language related brain structure. we performed magnetic resonance imaging scans of 15 adults with autistic disorder and 15 comparison subjects, and measured the volume of gray matter in the planum temporale and heschl's gyrus (hg) in both hemispheres. planum temporale volume reduced in the left hemisphere of the autism group (p<0.003). no differences in hg volumes were observed between the two groups. the volume reduction seen in the left hemisphere of the autism group may suggest an early neurodevelopmental disturbance in autism that impacts language development.
p19(arf) deficiency reduces macrophage and vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis and aggravates atherosclerosis. coronary heart disease (chd) is a major cause of death in western countries. we used genome-wide association scanning to identify a 58-kilobase interval on chromosome 9p21 that was consistently associated with chd in six independent samples (more than 23,000 participants) from four caucasian populations. this interval, which is located near the cdkn2a and cdkn2b genes, contains no annotated genes and is not associated with established chd risk factors such as plasma lipoproteins, hypertension, or diabetes. homozygotes for the risk allele make up 20 to 25% of caucasians and have a approximately 30 to 40% increased risk of chd.
expression and requirement of t-box transcription factors tbx2 and tbx3 during secondary palate development in the mouse. ephs and ephrins are cell surface receptors that bind to each other and initiate distinct, bidirectional signalling pathways in processes known as forward (eph) and reverse (ephrin) signalling. previous work had shown that the loss of ephrinb1 protein alone or compound loss of ephb2 and ephb3 leads to cleft palate. because of the bidirectional signalling capability of these molecules, it was not clear whether forward or reverse signalling caused the cleft palate in the ephrinb1 protein null or ephb2 and ephb3 compound null mice. we demonstrate that forward signalling is essential for palatogenesis. foetuses with a cytoplasmically truncated ephb2 protein, which could initiate reverse but not forward signalling, and were protein null for ephb3 had a cleft palate. this happened because their palatal shelves, which could elevate in vivo and adhere and fuse in culture, were too small to contact one another. small shelf size was due to reduced proliferation in the palatal mesenchyme. the reduced proliferation was not the result of abnormal vascular development within the palate. in conclusion, strong evidence is provided for specific and co-operative roles of ephb2 and ephb3 in palate development.
varcards: an integrated genetic and clinical database for coding variants in the human genome dna sequencing technologies continue to make progress in increased throughput and quality, and decreased cost. as we transition from whole exome capture sequencing to whole genome sequencing (wgs), our ability to convert machine-generated variant calls, including single nucleotide variant (snv) and insertion-deletion variants (indels), into human-interpretable knowledge has lagged far behind the ability to obtain enormous amounts of variants. to help narrow this gap, here we present wgsa (wgs annotator), a functional annotation pipeline for human genome sequencing studies, which is runnable out of the box on the amazon compute cloud and is freely downloadable at (https://sites.google.com/site/jpopgen/wgsa/).  functional annotation is a key step in wgs analysis. in one way, annotation helps the analyst filter to a subset of elements of particular interest (eg, cell type specific enhancers), in another way annotation helps the investigators to increase the power of identifying phenotype-associated loci (eg, association test using functional prediction score as a weight) and interpret potentially interesting findings. currently, there are several popular gene model based annotation tools, including annovar,1 snpeff2 and the ensembl variant effect predictor (vep).3 these can annotate a variety of protein coding and non-coding gene models from a range of species. it is well known among practitioners that different databases (eg, refseq4 and ensembl5) use different models for …
high-throughput screening of monoclonal antibodies against plant cell wall glycans by hierarchical clustering of their carbohydrate microarray binding profiles a range of synthetic methyl hexagalacturonates were used as potential hapten inhibitors in competitive-inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisas) with anti-homogalacturonan monoclonal antibodies lm7, jim5 and jim7. the selective inhibition of these antibodies by different haptens provides insight into the structures of the partially methyl-esterified pectin epitopes of these widely used monoclonal antibodies.
creb, nf-κb, and nadph oxidase coordinately upregulate indoxyl sulfate-induced angiotensinogen expression in proximal tubular cells. background previously, we demonstrated that indoxyl sulphate (is), a uraemic toxin, induced aortic calcification in hypertensive rats. this study aimed to determine if is induces the production of reactive oxygen species (ros) and the expression of osteoblast-specific proteins in human aortic smooth muscle cells (hasmcs).   methods in order to achieve these goals, hasmcs were incubated with is. ros were detected using probes with a fluorescence detector. the expression of alkaline phosphatase (alp), osteopontin and organic anion transporters (oat1, oat3) was studied by western blotting. the expression of core binding factor 1 (cbfa1), alp, osteopontin and nadph oxidases (nox1, nox2 and nox4) was analysed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). knockdown of nox4 was performed by rna interference (rnai).   results is induced ros generation and the expression of nox4, cbfa1, alp and osteopontin in hasmcs. a nadph oxidase inhibitor and antioxidants inhibited is-induced ros production and mrna expression of cbfa1 and alp. knockdown of nox4 using small interfering rna (sirna) inhibited is-induced ros production and mrna expression of cbfa1, alp and osteopontin. oat3 was expressed in hasmcs.   conclusions is induces ros generation by upregulating nox4, and the expression of osteoblast-specific proteins such as cbfa1, alp and osteopontin in hasmcs.
building a robust tumor profiling program: synergy between next-generation sequencing and targeted single-gene testing context the higher throughput and lower per-base cost of next-generation sequencing (ngs) as compared to sanger sequencing has led to its rapid adoption in clinical testing. the number of laboratories offering ngs-based tests has also grown considerably in the past few years, despite the fact that specific clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988/college of american pathologists (cap) laboratory standards had not yet been developed to regulate this technology.   objective to develop a checklist for clinical testing using ngs technology that sets standards for the analytic wet bench process and for bioinformatics or "dry bench" analyses. as ngs-based clinical tests are new to diagnostic testing and are of much greater complexity than traditional sanger sequencing-based tests, there is an urgent need to develop new regulatory standards for laboratories offering these tests.   design to develop the necessary regulatory framework for ngs and to facilitate appropriate adoption of this technology for clinical testing, cap formed a committee in 2011, the ngs work group, to deliberate upon the contents to be included in the checklist. results . -a total of 18 laboratory accreditation checklist requirements for the analytic wet bench process and bioinformatics analysis processes have been included within cap's molecular pathology checklist (mol).   conclusions this report describes the important issues considered by the cap committee during the development of the new checklist requirements, which address documentation, validation, quality assurance, confirmatory testing, exception logs, monitoring of upgrades, variant interpretation and reporting, incidental findings, data storage, version traceability, and data transfer confidentiality.
isolation and characterization of phages infecting bacillus subtilis prokaryote viruses include 14 officially accepted families and at least five other potential families awaiting classification. approximately 5,500 prokaryote viruses have been examined in the electron microscope. classification has a predictive value and is invaluable to control experimental techniques and results. in describing viruses, the choice of methods depends on structure and taxonomical position of viruses. the study of isometric, filamentous, and pleomorphic viruses requires more detailed investigations than that of tailed species.
chlorhexidine and alcohol versus povidone-iodine for antisepsis in gynecological surgery. objective the purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of chlorhexidine and povidone iodine for cleansing the operative field for vaginal surgery.   study design this was a randomized controlled trial that compared 10% povidone iodine and 4% chlorhexidine gluconate as surgical scrubs. our primary end point was the proportion of contaminated specimens (defined as total bacterial colony counts of >/=5000 colony-forming units) per group found throughout the surgical procedures. all patients received standard infection prophylaxis that included preoperative intravenous antibiotics. immediately before antibiotic administration and baseline aerobic and anaerobic cultures of the vaginal flora were obtained, which were followed by cultures at 30 minutes after the surgical scrub and hourly thereafter throughout each patient's surgery.   results a total of 50 patients were enrolled between october 2002 and september 2003. there were no differences between the povidone iodine (n = 27) and chlorhexidine (n = 23) groups with respect to age, race, exogenous hormone use, body mass index, gravity, parity, preoperative mean colony counts, or operative time. among the first set of intraoperative specimens (which were obtained 30 minutes after the surgical scrub), 63% of the cultures (17/27) from the povidone iodine group and 22% of the cultures (5/23) from the chlorhexidine group were classified as contaminated ( p = .003; relative risk, 6.12; 95% ci, 1.7, 21.6). subsequent cultures failed to demonstrate significant differences.   conclusion chlorhexidine gluconate was more effective than povidone iodine in decreasing the bacterial colony counts that were found in the operative field for vaginal hysterectomy.
intention to use mobile customer relationship management systems this research represents a theoretical extension of the technology acceptance model (tam), which is researchers have used to explain technologies’ perceived usefulness and individuals intention to use it. the authors developed a model, referred to as the mobile wireless technology acceptance model (mwtam), to test the relationship between theoretical constructs spanning technological influence processes (perceived ubiquity, and perceived reachability) and cognitive influence processes (job relevance, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use) and their impact on behavioral intention. mwtam is assessed using data collected from an online survey and analyzed using amos 5.0. results provide evidence to support mwtam as both the technological and cognitive influence processes accounted for 58.7% of the variance explained in an individual’s behavioral intention toward using mobile wireless technology. additionally, the path coefficients between constructs ranged from 0.241 to 0.572 providing further evidence to support the theoretical extension of tam.
development of the human insular cortex: differentiation, proliferation, cell death, and appearance of 5ht-2a receptors stress- and drug-related cues are major factors contributing to high rates of relapse in addictive disorders. brain imaging studies have begun to identify neural correlates of stress and drug cue-induced craving states. findings indicate considerable overlap in neural circuits involved in processing stress and drug cues with activity in the corticostriatal limbic circuitry underlying both affective and reward processing. more recent efforts have begun to identify the relationships between neural activity during stress and drug cue exposure and drug relapse outcomes. findings suggest medial prefrontal, anterior and posterior cingulate, striatal and posterior insula regions to be associated with relapse outcomes. altered function in these brain regions is associated with stress-induced and drug cue-induced craving states and an increased susceptibility to relapse. such alterations can serve as markers to identify relapse propensity and a more severe course of addiction. efficacy of pharmacological and behavioral treatments that specifically target stress and cue-induced craving and arousal responses may also be assessed via alterations in these brain correlates.
degradation of the separase-cleaved rec8, a meiotic cohesin subunit, by the n-end rule pathway* the n‐end rule relates the regulation of the in vivo half‐life of a protein to the identity of its n‐terminal residue. degradation signals (degrons) that are targeted by the n‐end rule pathway include a set called n‐degrons. the main determinant of an n‐degron is a destabilizing n‐terminal residue of a protein. in eukaryotes, the n‐end rule pathway is a part of the ubiquitin system and consists of two branches, the ac/n‐end rule and the arg/n‐end rule pathways. the ac/n‐end rule pathway targets proteins containing nα‐terminally acetylated (nt‐acetylated) residues. the arg/n‐end rule pathway recognizes unacetylated n‐terminal residues and involves n‐terminal arginylation. together, these branches target for degradation a majority of cellular proteins. for example, more than 80% of human proteins are cotranslationally nt‐acetylated. thus, most proteins harbor a specific degradation signal, termed acn‐degron, from the moment of their birth. specific n‐end rule pathways are also present in prokaryotes and in mitochondria. enzymes that produce n‐degrons include methionine‐aminopeptidases, caspases, calpains, nt‐acetylases, nt‐amidases, arginyl‐transferases, and leucyl‐transferases. regulated degradation of specific proteins by the n‐end rule pathway mediates a legion of physiological functions, including the sensing of heme, oxygen, and nitric oxide; selective elimination of misfolded proteins; the regulation of dna repair, segregation, and condensation; the signaling by g proteins; the regulation of peptide import, fat metabolism, viral and bacterial infections, apoptosis, meiosis, spermatogenesis, neurogenesis, and cardiovascular development; and the functioning of adult organs, including the pancreas and the brain. discovered 25 years ago, this pathway continues to be a fount of biological insights.
a gene encoding a new cold-active lipase from an antarctic isolate of penicilliumexpansum lipases are acyl hydrolases that play a key role in fat digestion by cleaving long-chain triglycerides into polar lipids. due to an opposite polarity between the enzyme (hydrophilic) and their substrates (lipophilic), lipase reaction occurs at the interface between the aqueous and the oil phases. hence, interfaces are the key spots for lipase biocatalysis and an appropriate site for modulating lipolysis. surprisingly enough, knowledge about the effects of the interfacial composition on lipase catalysis is still limited and only described by the term "interfacial quality". recent systematic studies based on a biophysical approach allowed for the first time to show the effects of the interfacial microenvironment on lipase catalysis. these studies demonstrate that lipase activity as a function of interfacial composition is more attributed to substrate inaccessibility rather than to enzyme denaturation or inactivation, as it is often hypothesized. a detailed analysis of the interfacial properties of all compounds involved in triglyceride digestion revealed that lipolysis is a self-regulated reaction. this feedback mechanism can be explored as a new avenue to control lipase catalysis. to substantiate this hypothesis, oil hydrolysis in a model gastro-intestinal system was performed, which can be seen as an interfacial engineering approach to enzyme reactivity control. the presented characterization of the interfacial composition and its consequences provide a new approach for the understanding of lipase reactions at interfaces with direct impact on biotechnological and health care applications.
modulating the vascular response to limb ischemia: angiogenic and cell therapies. background— embryonic stem (es) cells are distinguished by their capacity for self-renewal and pluripotency. here we characterize the differentiation of es cell–derived endothelial cells (esc-ecs), use molecular imaging techniques to examine their survival in vivo, and determine the therapeutic efficacy of esc-ecs for restoration of cardiac function after ischemic injury. methods and results— murine es cells were transfected with a construct composed of a vascular endothelial cadherin promoter driving enhanced green fluorescence protein (pve-cadherin-egfp). differentiation of es cells to ecs was detected by facs analysis using flk-1 (early ec marker at day 4) and ve-cadherin (late ec marker at day 8). after isolation, these esc-ecs express endothelial cell markers similar to adult mouse lung endothelial cells, form vascular-like channels, and incorporate dii-labeled acetylated low-density lipoprotein (dii-ac-ldl). for in vivo imaging, es cells were transduced with an ubiquitin promoter driving firefly luciferase and monomeric red fluorescence protein (pub-fluc-mrfp). a robust correlation exists between fluc signals and cell numbers by ex vivo imaging analysis (r2=0.98) and by in vitro enzyme assay (r2=0.94). afterward, 5×105 esc-ecs or pbs (as control) was injected into the hearts of mice undergoing lad ligation (n=15 per group). bioluminescence imaging showed longitudinal survival of transplanted esc-ecs for ≈8 weeks. echocardiogram demonstrated significant functional improvement in the esc-ec group compared with control (p=0.04). finally, postmortem analysis confirmed increased presence of small capillaries and venules in the infarcted zones by cd31 staining. conclusions— this is the first study to track the fate and function of transplanted esc-ecs in the heart. with further validation, these esc-ecs could become a valuable source of cell therapy for induction of angiogenesis in the treatment of myocardial ischemia.
differentiating sct and inattentive symptoms in adhd using fmri measures of cognitive control objective directed attention, the ability to allocate and direct attention toward a salient stimulus, is impaired in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd). this construct is often assessed with target detection or oddball tasks, and individuals with adhd perform poorly on such tasks. however, to date, the specific brain structures or neural mechanisms underlying target detection dysfunction in individuals with adhd have not been identified. the authors' goal was to investigate neural correlates of target detection dysfunction in adhd using event-related fmri.   method behavioral and brain activation data were collected while subjects performed a visual oddball task. participants included 14 right-handed male adolescents with adhd (combined type) and 12 typically developing age- and handedness-matched male comparison subjects.   results individuals with adhd made significantly more errors of commission than comparison subjects. further, relative to comparison subjects, individuals with adhd showed significantly less activation in the bilateral parietal lobes (including the superior parietal gyrus and supramarginal and angular gyri of the inferior parietal lobe), right precuneus, and thalamus.   conclusions adolescents with adhd demonstrated significant impairments in their ability to direct and allocate attentional resources. these difficulties were associated with significant aberrations in the parietal attentional system, which is known to play a significant role in attention shifting and detecting specific or salient targets. thus, dysfunction in the parietal attentional system may play a significant role in the behavioral phenotype of adhd.
a new, simple, rapid test for detection of dnase activity of microorganisms: dnase tube test. some years ago a “desoxyribonuclease” was found’ in the culture medium of staphylococcus aureus that was unaffected by heating in a boiling-water bath. the enzyme has proved useful in end-group studies of desoxyribonucleic acids and fragments thereof, because the products of its action bear the singly esterified phosphate a t the 3’ position?, as was first pointed out by j. d. smith,4 ribonucleic acid is also attacked, again only a t the 5’ phosphodiester bond, giving rise to nucleoside 3‘-phosphates in addition to larger, homologous fragments. other similarities between the desoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease activities itre the unusual stability of the enzyme,” the ph optimum of 8.6; and the requirement for calcium ion’’ at about 0.01 &/i concentration. it appears that, when the enzyme is in the culture medium, it can digest extracellular nucleic acids5 which, in default of enzyme action, accumulate as part of a slime layer. the enzyme is salted out of the culture medium after boiling and washed with 2.5 per cent trichloroacetic acid saturated with ammonium chloride, followed by 83 per cent ethanol.’ since the washing is carried out at room temperature, any traces of relatively labile contaminating enzymes that survived the boiling probably would be destroyed. terminal digests of natural nucleic acids are complex mixtures (figure 1). the values, perhaps, match as well as could be expected in view of the initial base differences in the two substrates, except for a marked, unexplained discrepancy between guanylic acid and desoxyguanylic acid. end-group determinations2, 6 , showed that in several dinucleotidc fractions ;i single sequence accounted for 90 per cent or more of the material. the favored sequences were: desoxyadenylyl desoxycytidylic acid (apcp) and desoxyadenylyl desoxyguanylic acid (apgp) in both the desoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid digests, and desoxythymidylyl desoxycytidylic acid (tpcp) and desoxythymidylyl desoxyguanylic acid (tpgp) in the desoxyribonucleic acid digest; sequence was not determined in other ribodinucleotide fractions. however, both desoxythymidylyl desoxyadenylic acid (tpap) and desoxyadenylyl desoxythymidylic acid (aptp) were well represented (about two parts of the former to one of the latter). there are also trinucleotides or larger fragments that may contain any base of the original substrate. a possible clue to the reason for their presence in the digests is the fact that they are absent after digestion of certain synthetic polynucleotides (the only ones investigated so far) which lack cytosine, uracil, and guanine (figure 2). the experiment with polyadcnylic acid indicat etl t ha t the sequence apa must be both susceptible to cleavage (othcrwise there would be no digest ion)
therapeutic targeting using tumor specific peptides inhibits long non-coding rna hotair activity in ovarian and breast cancer long noncoding rnas (lncrnas) are key regulators of chromatin state, yet the nature and sites of rna-chromatin interaction are mostly unknown. here we introduce chromatin isolation by rna purification (chirp), where tiling oligonucleotides retrieve specific lncrnas with bound protein and dna sequences, which are enumerated by deep sequencing. chirp-seq of three lncrnas reveal that rna occupancy sites in the genome are focal, sequence-specific, and numerous. drosophila rox2 rna occupies male x-linked gene bodies with increasing tendency toward the 3' end, peaking at ces sites. human telomerase rna terc occupies telomeres and wnt pathway genes. hotair lncrna preferentially occupies a ga-rich dna motif to nucleate broad domains of polycomb occupancy and histone h3 lysine 27 trimethylation. hotair occupancy occurs independently of ezh2, suggesting the order of rna guidance of polycomb occupancy. chirp-seq is generally applicable to illuminate the intersection of rna and chromatin with newfound precision genome wide.
thrombospondin-1 interacts with trypanosoma cruzi surface calreticulin to enhance cellular infection calreticulin, a calcium-binding protein that is highly conserved in its multiple functions, is present in a wide spectrum of subcellular compartments in virtually every cell of higher organisms. in this article, we propose a dual role for parasite calreticulin, with emphasis on the trypanosoma cruzi model. by modulating the vertebrate complement system, calreticulin might provide the parasite with an effective immune-escape mechanism. alternatively, by inhibiting angiogenesis, the parasite molecule might protect the host from ongoing neoplasic aggressions. many questions are still unanswered, particularly those regarding the consequences that these interactions could have in vivo for both the parasite and the host.
topical chlorhexidine for prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia: a meta-analysis* objective the purpose of this study was to describe the effect of an early post-intubation oral application of chlorhexidine gluconate on oral microbial flora and ventilator-associated pneumonia.   methods thirty-four intubated patients were randomly assigned to chlorhexidine gluconate by spray or swab or to control group. oral cultures were done at study admission, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours, whereas the clinical pulmonary infection score (cpis) was documented at study admission, 48, and 72 hours.   results reductions in oral culture scores (less growth) were only found in the treatment groups (swab and spray); no reduction was found in the control group. there was a trend for fewer positive cultures in the combined treatment groups. the mean cpis for the control group increased to a level indicating pneumonia (4.7 to 6.6), whereas the cpis for the treatment group increased only slightly (5.17 to 5.57).   conclusions trends in the data suggest that use of chlorhexidine gluconate in the early post-intubation period may mitigate or delay the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
outcomes associated with early removal versus retention of peripherally inserted central catheters after diagnosis of catheter-associated infections in neonates objectives patients admitted to neonatal intensive care units (nicus) are at high risk of nosocomial infection. we conducted a national multicenter assessment of nosocomial infections in nicus to determine the prevalence of infections, describe associated risk factors, and help focus prevention efforts.   study design we conducted a point prevalence survey of nosocomial infections in 29 pediatric prevention network nicus. patients present on the survey date were included. data were collected on underlying diagnoses, therapeutic interventions/treatments, infections, and outcomes.   results of the 827 patients surveyed, 94 (11.4%) had 116 nicu-acquired infections: bloodstream (52.6%), lower respiratory tract (12.9%), ear-nose-throat (8.6%), or urinary tract infections (8.6%). infants with infections were of significantly lower birth weight (median 1006 g [range 441 to 4460 g] vs 1589 g [range 326 to 5480 g]; p <.001) and had longer median durations of stay than those without infections (88 days [range 8 to 279 days] vs 32 days [range 1 to 483 days]; p <.001). most common pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci. patients with central intravascular catheters (relative risk = 3.81, ci 2.32-6.25; p <.001) or receiving total parenteral nutrition (relative risk = 5.72, ci 3.45-9.49; p <.001) were at greater risk of bloodstream infection.   conclusions this study documents the high prevalence of nosocomial infections in patients in nicus and the urgent need for more effective prevention interventions.
iron chelator inducesmip-3α/ccl20 in human intestinal epithelial cells: implication for triggering mucosal adaptive immunity dendritic cells (dcs) form a network comprising different populations that initiate and differentially regulate immune responses. langerhans cells (lcs) represent a unique population of dcs colonizing epithelium, and we present here observations suggesting that macrophage inflammatory protein (mip)-3α plays a central role in lc precursor recruitment into the epithelium during inflammation. (a) among dc populations, mip-3α was the most potent chemokine inducing the selective migration of in vitro–generated cd34+ hematopoietic progenitor cell–derived lc precursors and skin lcs in accordance with the restricted mip-3α receptor (cc chemokine receptor 6) expression to these cells. (b) mip-3α was mainly produced by epithelial cells, and the migration of lc precursors induced by the supernatant of activated skin keratinocytes was completely blocked with an antibody against mip-3α. (c) in vivo, mip-3α was selectively produced at sites of inflammation as illustrated in tonsils and lesional psoriatic skin where mip-3α upregulation appeared associated with an increase in lc turnover. (d) finally, the secretion of mip-3α was strongly upregulated by cells of epithelial origin after inflammatory stimuli (interleukin 1β plus tumor necrosis factor α) or t cell signals. results of this study suggest a major role of mip-3α in epithelial colonization by lcs under inflammatory conditions and immune disorders, and might open new ways to control epithelial immunity.
the monoaminergic modulation of sensory-mediated aversive responses in caenorhabditis elegans requires glutamatergic/peptidergic cotransmission neuropeptides play critical roles in synaptic signaling in all nervous systems. unlike classical neurotransmitters, peptidergic neurotransmitters are encoded as preproproteins that are posttranslationally processed to yield bioactive neuropeptides. to identify novel peptidergic neurotransmitters, the caenorhabditis elegans genome was searched for predicted proteins with the structural hallmarks of neuropeptide preproproteins. thirty-two c. elegans neuropeptide-like protein (nlp) genes were identified. the nlp genes define at least 11 families of putative neuropeptides with unique motifs; similar expressed sequence tags were identified in other invertebrate species for all 11 families. six of these families are defined by putative bioactive motifs (fafa, ggxyamide, mrxamide, lqfamide, lxdxamide, and ggaraf); the remaining five families are related to allatostatin, myomodulin, buccalin/drosulfakinin, orcokinin, and apgwamide neuropeptides (mgl/famide, frpamide, msfamide, gfxgf, and yggwamide families, respectively). most c. elegans nlp gene expression is in neurons. the c. elegans nlp genes and similar genes encoding putative neuropeptides in other species are likely to play diverse roles in nervous system function.
systematic inequality and hierarchy in faculty hiring networks networks—an introduction.marke. j.newman. (2010,oxforduniversity press.) $65.38, £35.96 (hardcover), 772 pages. isbn-978-0-19-920665-0. network science or graph theory has its roots in the first half of the 18th century when leonhard euler, a prussian mathematician, analyzed the problem of finding a route through the city of königsberg that crossed every one of the cityʼs seven major bridges once and only once. ever since then, network theory has attracted the interest of mathematicians like the famous paul erdős, who (together with alfréd rényi [2] and independently gilbert [3]) was first to define random graphs in the late 1950s. later, social scientists joined in founding social network theory as a new branch of the field. in the last two decades, an explosion of research into network science has been stimulated by the recent introduction of the small-world [4] and scale-free [1] network paradigms. as a result, the field has become ever more multidisciplinary, and concepts from network theory have become standard knowledge in many areas of the natural and social sciences. examples of fields where network approaches have almost become standard tools are computer science, systems biology, engineering, and physics, just to name a few. at the same time, the knowledge about network theory has become somewhat fragmented: different terminology is used in different fields, and often solutions to problems that have been developed for one set of applications are not readily accessible to practitioners in other areas. with his new booknetworks—an introduction, mark newman aims at bridging this gap. using a consistent terminology, the book provides a summary of the knowledge about the empirical analysis and theory of networks that has been accumulated in this diverse set of disciplines over many years. the book is very successful in this pursuit and gives an excellent introduction to the topic of network theory. not only this, gradually working its way up from introductory content to more advanced topics, the book also provides a neat collection of relevant material for the more advanced reader. a set of problems at the end of most chapters allows the reader to check his or her understanding of the presented material. altogether, i highly recommend this book, not only for the non-specialist reader who wants to understand what network theory is all about, but also for the specialist who wants to use the book as a quick reference or as the basis for an undergraduate or more advanced course taught at a university. after so much praise, let us have a brief look at the content of the book. it basically consists of five parts. the first part highlights the interdisciplinary nature of network applications and discusses examples from four different areas of research: infrastructure networks, social networks, networks linked to the transmission of information, and biological networks. in each of these broad application areas the author explains the most prominent examples and illustrates the relevance of network approaches. the second part of the book is composed of an introduction to the fundamentals of network theory. chapter ii.6 sets out with a series of definitions of various types of networks, followed by the introduction of various metrics generally used to classify networks. chapter ii.8 discusses smallworldness, degree distributions, clustering, and assortative mixes of degrees, and finishes by giving a classification of networks in terms of their macroscopic appearance. having defined network metrics, the next logical step is to think about efficient computer algorithms to evaluate them for a given network. accordingly, the third part of the book gives a very useful summary of some frequently applied computer algorithms. again the chapter starts with a readily accessible introduction to some basics, such as various methods of storing a networks in computer memory. the author then quickly progresses to algorithms for the efficient computation of graph
locked nucleic acid gapmers and conjugates induce potent silencing of adam 33 , an asthma-associated metalloprotease with nuclear-localized mrna antisense oligonucleotides (asos) can suppress the expression of a target gene by cleaving pre-mrna and/or mature mrna via rnase h1. following the initial endonucleolytic cleavage by rnase h1, the target rnas are degraded by a mechanism that is poorly understood. to better understand this degradation pathway, we depleted the expression of two major 5' to 3' exoribonucleases (xrns), named xrn1 and xrn2, and analyzed the levels of 3' fragments of the target rnas in vitro. we found that the 3' fragments of target pre-mrna generated by aso were almost completely degraded from their 5' ends by nuclear xrn2 after rnase h1-mediated cleavage, whereas the 3' fragments of mature mrna were partially degraded by xrn2. in contrast to aso, small interference rna (sirna) could reduce the expression level of only mature mrna, and the 3' fragment was degraded by cytoplasmic xrn1. our findings indicate that the rnas targeted by rnase h1-dependent aso are rapidly degraded in the nucleus, contrary to the cytoplasmic degradation pathway mediated by sirna.
metabolite profiling of symbiont and host during thermal stress and bleaching in a model cnidarian–dinoflagellate symbiosis stable cnidarian-dinoflagellate (genus symbiodinium) endosymbioses depend on the regulation of nutrient transport between symbiodinium populations and their hosts. it has been previously shown that the host cytosol is a nitrogen-deficient environment for the intracellular symbiodinium and may act to limit growth rates of symbionts during the symbiotic association. this study aimed to investigate the cell proliferation, as well as ultrastructural and lipid compositional changes, in free-living symbiodinium spp. (clade b) upon nitrogen (n)-deprivation. the cell proliferation of the n-deprived cells decreased significantly. furthermore, staining with a fluorescent probe, boron dipyrromethane 493/503 (bodipy 493/503), indicated that lipid contents progressively accumulated in the n-deprived cells. lipid analyses further showed that both triacylglycerol (tag) and cholesterol ester (ce) were drastically enriched, with polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa; i.e., docosahexaenoic acid, heneicosapentaenoic acid, and oleic acid) became more abundant. ultrastructural examinations showed that the increase in concentration of these lipid species was due to the accumulation of lipid droplets (lds), a cellular feature that have previously shown to be pivotal in the maintenance of intact endosymbioses. integrity of these stable lds was maintained via electronegative repulsion and steric hindrance possibly provided by their surface proteins. proteomic analyses of these lds identified proteins putatively involved in lipid metabolism, signaling, stress response and energy metabolism. these results suggest that lds production may be an adaptive response that enables symbiodinium to maintain sufficient cellular energy stores for survival under the n-deprived conditions in the host cytoplasm.
optical characterization of two-layered turbid media for non-invasive, absolute oximetry in cerebral and extracerebral tissue we present near-infrared spectroscopy measurement of absolute cerebral hemoglobin concentration and saturation in a large sample of 36 healthy elderly (mean age, 85 ± 6 years) and 19 young adults (mean age, 28 ± 4 years). non-invasive measurements were obtained on the forehead using a commercially available multi-distance frequency-domain system and analyzed using a diffusion theory model for a semi-infinite, homogeneous medium with semi-infinite boundary conditions. our study included repeat measurements, taken five months apart, on 16 elderly volunteers that demonstrate intra-subject reproducibility of the absolute measurements with cross-correlation coefficients of 0.9 for absorption coefficient (μa), oxy-hemoglobin concentration ([hbo2]), and total hemoglobin concentration ([hbt]), 0.7 for deoxy-hemoglobin concentration ([hb]), 0.8 for hemoglobin oxygen saturation (sto2), and 0.7 for reduced scattering coefficient (μ's). we found significant differences between the two age groups. compared to young subjects, elderly subjects had lower cerebral [hbo2], [hb], [hbt], and sto2 by 10 ± 4 μm, 4 ± 3 μm, 14 ± 5 μm, and 6%±5%, respectively. our results demonstrate the reliability and robustness of multi-distance near-infrared spectroscopy measurements based on a homogeneous model in the human forehead on a large sample of human subjects. absolute, non-invasive optical measurements on the brain, such as those presented here, can significantly advance the development of nirs technology as a tool for monitoring resting/basal cerebral perfusion, hemodynamics, oxygenation, and metabolism.
nodular regenerative hyperplasia secondary to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal liver metastases background in advanced metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma, the addition of a neo-adjuvant systemic treatment to surgery might translate into a survival advantage, although this is yet to be confirmed by ongoing randomized trials. the objective of this study was to assess the effects of preoperative systemic chemotherapy on the morphology of non-tumoral liver.   patients and methods a large series of surgically resected liver metastases (n=153) was selected. light microscopy, electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry using antibodies against endothelial cells (cd31) and hepatic stellate cells (alpha-sm actin, crbp-1) were performed to identify sinusoidal wall integrity.   results we found that 44 (51%) of the 87 post-chemotherapic liver resection specimens had sinusoidal dilatation and hemorrhage, related to rupture of the sinusoidal barrier. in contrast, the 66 livers treated by surgery alone remained normal. in 21 out of the 44 post-chemotherapy patients (48%), perisinusoidal and veno-occlusive fibrosis also developed. sinusoidal injury persisted several months after end of chemotherapy, and fibrosis may progress. development of lesions was strongly correlated to the use of oxaliplatin; 34 out of 43 patients (78%) treated with this drug showed striking sinusoidal alterations.   conclusions systemic neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer frequently causes morphological lesions involving hepatic microvasculature. sinusoidal obstruction, complicated by perisinusoidal fibrosis and veno-occlusive lesion of the non-tumoral liver revealed by this study, should be included in the list of the adverse side-effects of colorectal systemic chemotherapy, in particular related to the use of oxaliplatin.
developmental differences in the shear stress-induced expression of endothelial no synthase: changing role of ap-1. the ultraviolet (uv) response of mammalian cells is characterized by a rapid and selective increase in gene expression mediated by ap-1 and nf-kappa b. the effect on ap-1 transcriptional activity results, in part, from enhanced phosphorylation of the c-jun nh2-terminal activation domain. here, we describe the molecular cloning and characterization of jnk1, a distant relative of the map kinase group that is activated by dual phosphorylation at thr and tyr during the uv response. significantly, ha-ras partially activates jnk1 and potentiates the activation caused by uv. jnk1 binds to the c-jun transactivation domain and phosphorylates it on ser-63 and ser-73. thus, jnk1 is a component of a novel signal transduction pathway that is activated by oncoproteins and uv irradiation. these properties indicate that jnk1 activation may play an important role in tumor promotion.
dna recognition by the swai restriction endonuclease involves unusual distortion of an 8 base pair a:t-rich target transcription factors can be divided into classes on the basis of their mode of interaction with the target promoter sequence. different protein domains responsible for dna recognition have been identified. in this review we discuss the leucine zipper structure, which has been found in several nuclear factors, including the oncoproteins fos and jun. structural considerations are summarized to help understand how dimerization is mediated by the leucine zipper and how this is the prerequisite for optimal target dna recognition by the adjacent basic domains.
makings of the best spermatozoa: molecular determinants of high fertility spermatozoa deliver more than the paternal genome into the oocyte; they also carry remnant messenger rna from spermatogenesis. the rna profiles of spermatozoa from high-fertility and a low-fertility holstein bulls were analysed using affymetrix bovine genechips. a total of 415 transcripts out of approximately 24,000 were differentially detected in spermatozoa collected from both bulls (fold change > or =2.0; p<0.01). these transcripts were associated with different cellular functions and biological processes. spermatozoa from high-fertility bulls contained higher concentrations of transcripts for membrane and extracellular space protein locations, while spermatozoa from the low-fertility bulls were deficient of transcripts for transcriptional and translational factors. quantitative real-time pcr was used on three low-fertility and four high-fertility bulls to validate the microarray data. two highly represented transcripts in the microarray analysis (protamine 1 and casein beta 2) were validated, as well as a third transcript (thrombospondin receptor cd36 molecule) that showed a lower concentration in low-fertility bulls. this study presents the global analysis of spermatozoa originating from bulls with opposite fertility. these results provide some specific transcripts in spermatozoa that could be associated with bull fertility.
mineralogy and crystallography of some itokawa particles returned by the hayabusa asteroidal sample return mission laboratory analysis of samples returned from an asteroid establishes a direct link between asteroids and meteorites and provides clues to the complex history of the asteroid and its surface. meteorite studies suggest that each solar system object has a unique oxygen isotopic composition. chondrites, the most primitive of meteorites, have been believed to be derived from asteroids, but oxygen isotopic compositions of asteroids themselves have not been established. we measured, using secondary ion mass spectrometry, oxygen isotopic compositions of rock particles from asteroid 25143 itokawa returned by the hayabusa spacecraft. compositions of the particles are depleted in 16o relative to terrestrial materials and indicate that itokawa, an s-type asteroid, is one of the sources of the ll or l group of equilibrated ordinary chondrites. this is a direct oxygen-isotope link between chondrites and their parent asteroid.
the role of fat emulsion therapy in a rodent model of propranolol toxicity: a preliminary study amphotericin b (amb) remains the gold standard for the treatment of invasive fungal infections. however, the efficacy is limited, with response rates from 10% to 80%. moreover, amb is toxic, especially for the kidneys. new formulations have been developed in an attempt to improve both efficacy and tolerability. in an attempt to reduce toxicity, a number of investigators have reconstituted amb in a lipid emulsion, but few data are available on efficacy in documented infections. an improvement in immediate and renal tolerance was obtained with equivalent daily dose regimens, but the therapeutic index does not appear to be improved. this approach cannot be recommended at present. three lipid formulations have been developed and are now available in most countries: amb colloidal dispersion (abcd), amb lipid complex (ablc), and liposomal amb (ambisome). the efficacy of abcd on various fungal infections has been assessed in open trials, with a response rate of 49% in aspergillosis, 70% in candidiasis, and 67% in mucormycosis. in two randomized trials comparing abcd with amb in invasive aspergillosis and in persistent febrile neutropenia, the response rates were equivalent. abcd was less nephrotoxic. in contrast, immediate reactions to abcd were as frequent and severe as with amb. these immediate effects are more frequent during the first infusions and lessen as treatment continues. the recommended dose is 3–4 mg/kg/day. ablc appeared to be effective as rescue therapy in various types of invasive mycoses, with a response rate of 42% in aspergillosis, 67% in candidiasis, and 82% in fusariosis. efficacy identical to that of amb was demonstrated in a comparative randomized trial involving patients with invasive candidiasis. general and renal tolerability is improved compared with amb. the recommended dose regimen is 5 mg/kg/day. liposomal amb (ambisome) is the only truly liposomal formulation. the response rates in preliminary trials were 66% in aspergillosis and 81% in candidiasis. several comparative studies have confirmed that this formulation has similar or superior efficacy relative to amb in various fungal infections and also in the empirical treatment of febrile neutropenia. renal and general tolerability is excellent. the optimal dosing remains unclear but is generally between 3 and 5 mg/kg/day. a double‐blind trial comparing the tolerance of liposomal amb and ablc demonstrated that both infusion‐related events and nephrotoxicity were significantly lower for liposomal amb. in sum, the new lipid formulations of amb are effective in various invasive fungal infections. the three formulations exhibit reduced nephrotoxicity compared with conventional amb. large‐scale comparative clinical trials may clarify issues of relative efficacy in various forms of mycotic infections. note
mechanisms contributing to prefrontal cortex maturation during adolescence the adolescent susceptibility to the onset of psychiatric disorders is only beginning to be understood when factoring in the development of the prefrontal cortex (pfc). the functional maturation of the pfc is dependent upon proper integration of glutamatergic inputs from the ventral hippocampus (vhipp) and the basolateral amygdala (bla). here we assessed how transient nmdar blockade during adolescence alters the functional interaction of vhipp–bla inputs in regulating pfc plasticity. local field potential recordings were used to determine changes in long-term depression (ltd) and long-term potentiation (ltp) of pfc responses resulting from vhipp and bla high-frequency stimulation in adult rats that received repeated injections of saline or the nmdar antagonist mk-801 from postnatal day 35 (p35) to p40. we found that early adolescent mk-801 exposure elicited an age- and input-specific dysregulation of vhipp–pfc plasticity, characterized by a shift from ltd to ltp without altering the bla-induced ltp. data also showed that the vhipp normally resets the ltp state of bla transmission; however, this inhibitory regulation is absent following early adolescent mk-801 treatment. this deficit was reminiscent of pfc responses seen in drug-naive juveniles. notably, local prefrontal upregulation of gabaaα1 function completely restored vhipp functionality and its regulation of bla plasticity in mk-801-treated rats. thus, nmdar signaling is critical for the periadolescent acquisition of a gaba-dependent hippocampal control of pfc plasticity, which enables the inhibitory control of the prefrontal output by the vhipp. a dysregulation of this pathway can alter pfc processing of other converging afferents such as those from the bla.
meta-analysis comparing outcomes of fixed-bearing and mobile-bearing prostheses in total knee arthroplasty. this paper examines eight published reviews each reporting results from several related trials. each review pools the results from the relevant trials in order to evaluate the efficacy of a certain treatment for a specified medical condition. these reviews lack consistent assessment of homogeneity of treatment effect before pooling. we discuss a random effects approach to combining evidence from a series of experiments comparing two treatments. this approach incorporates the heterogeneity of effects in the analysis of the overall treatment efficacy. the model can be extended to include relevant covariates which would reduce the heterogeneity and allow for more specific therapeutic recommendations. we suggest a simple noniterative procedure for characterizing the distribution of treatment effects in a series of studies.
an artificial life approach for semi-supervised learning semi-supervised clustering employs a small amount of labeled data to aid unsupervised learning. previous work in the area has utilized supervised data in one of two approaches: 1) constraint-based methods that guide the clustering algorithm towards a better grouping of the data, and 2) distance-function learning methods that adapt the underlying similarity metric used by the clustering algorithm. this paper provides new methods for the two approaches as well as presents a new semi-supervised clustering algorithm that integrates both of these techniques in a uniform, principled framework. experimental results demonstrate that the unified approach produces better clusters than both individual approaches as well as previously proposed semi-supervised clustering algorithms.
characterization of the δ7 mutant of cupriavidus metallidurans with deletions of seven secondary metal uptake systems cupriavidus metallidurans ch34 possesses a multitude of metal efflux systems. here, the function of the novel pib4‐type atpase czcp is characterized, which belongs to the plasmid pmol30‐mediated cobalt‐zinc‐cadmium (czc) resistance system. contribution of czcp to transition metal resistance in c. metallidurans was compared with that of three pib2‐type atpases (cada, znta, prba) and to other efflux proteins by construction and characterization of multiple deletion mutants. these data also yielded additional evidence for an export of metal cations from the periplasm to the outside of the cell rather than from the cytoplasm to the outside. moreover, metal‐sensitive escherichia coli strains were functionally substituted in trans with czcp and the three pib2‐type atpases. metal transport kinetics performed with inside‐out vesicles identified the main substrates for these four exporters, the km values and apparent turn‐over numbers. in combination with the mutant data, transport kinetics indicated that czcp functions as ‘resistance enhancer’: this pib4‐type atpase exports transition metals zn2+, cd2+ and co2+ much more rapidly than the three pib2‐type proteins. however, a basic resistance level has to be provided by the pib2‐type efflux pumps because czcp may not be able to reach all different speciations of these metals in the cytoplasm.
structural basis for ampk activation: natural and synthetic ligands regulate kinase activity from opposite poles by different molecular mechanisms. amp-activated protein kinase (ampk) plays a major role in regulating cellular energy balance by sensing and responding to increases in amp/adp concentration relative to atp. binding of amp causes allosteric activation of the enzyme and binding of either amp or adp promotes and maintains the phosphorylation of threonine 172 within the activation loop of the kinase. ampk has attracted widespread interest as a potential therapeutic target for metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes and, more recently, cancer. a number of direct ampk activators have been reported as having beneficial effects in treating metabolic diseases, but there has been no structural basis for activator binding to ampk. here we present the crystal structure of human ampk in complex with a small molecule activator that binds at a site between the kinase domain and the carbohydrate-binding module, stabilising the interaction between these two components. the nature of the activator-binding pocket suggests the involvement of an additional, as yet unidentified, metabolite in the physiological regulation of ampk. importantly, the structure offers new opportunities for the design of small molecule activators of ampk for treatment of metabolic disorders.
relationship between perceived body weight and body mass index based on self- reported height and weight among university students: a cross-sectional study in seven european countries objectives: to assess eating habits and some food related behaviours, beliefs and knowledge in educated young french adults.design: a standardized questionnaire administered in university classes.setting: university or ‘grandes ecoles’ of paris and dijon.subjects: 660 male and female french students.interventions: international survey; questionnaire composed of three major sections: (1) health-related attitudes such as substances used, dieting, health practices; (2) beliefs concerning behaviour and health, including eating habits; (3) knowledge, namely relevance of factors to diseases such as cancer or cardiovascular diseases.results: gender, self-perception of body size, bmi and attempts to lose weight affected a number of behaviours. average bmi corresponded to standard values. ’healthy’ behaviours were often reported such as: avoiding fat and cholesterol, efforts to eat fruit and fiber. the french students showed a low frequency of snacking and a high regularity in having breakfast, especially respondents with lower bmi (females ≤23 and males ≤24.5 kg/m2). beliefs about the importance of behaviours were closely associated with the performance of the behaviours. awareness of the role of eating factors in cardiovascular diseases was observed.conclusion: the meal and snack pattern in french students is very close to the traditional model. more food- and health-related behaviours and attitudes are reported by women than men. some of them could be due to a genuine motivation for prevention and health in females or else to a greater wish to be thin. ‘desire to lose weight’ is often reported although bmi values are normally low in this young population. beliefs in the importance of a behaviour for health are correlated with the reported performance of the behaviours.sponsorship: data entry was supported in part through the commission of the european communities, medical and health research programme, concerted action on breakdown in human adaptation: quantification of parameters.
vestibular blueprint in early vertebrates the development and evolution of the inner ear sensory patches and their innervation is reviewed. recent molecular developmental data suggest that development of these sensory patches is a developmental recapitulation of the evolutionary history. these data suggest that the ear generates multiple, functionally diverse sensory epithelia by dividing a single sensory primordium. those epithelia will establish distinct identities through the overlapping expression of genes of which only a few are currently known. one of these distinctions is the unique pattern of hair cell polarity. a hypothesis is presented on how the hair cell polarity may relate to the progressive segregation of the six sensory epithelia. besides being markers for sensory epithelia development, neurotrophins are also expressed in delaminating cells that migrate toward the developing vestibular and cochlear ganglia. these delaminating cells originate from multiple sites at or near the developing sensory epithelia and some also express neuronal markers such as neurod. the differential origin of precursors raises the possibility that some sensory neurons acquire positional information before they delaminate the ear. such an identity of these delaminating sensory neurons may be used both to navigate their dendrites to the area they delaminated from, as well as to help them navigate to their central target. the navigational properties of sensory neurons as well as the acquisition of discrete sensory patch phenotypes implies a much more sophisticated subdivision of the developing otocyst than the few available gene expression studies suggest.
computational methodology for chip-seq analysis recent progress in massively parallel sequencing platforms has enabled genome-wide characterization of dna-associated proteins using the combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (chip-seq). although a variety of methods exist for analysis of the established alternative chip microarray (chip-chip), few approaches have been described for processing chip-seq data. to fill this gap, we propose an analysis pipeline specifically designed to detect protein-binding positions with high accuracy. using previously reported data sets for three transcription factors, we illustrate methods for improving tag alignment and correcting for background signals. we compare the sensitivity and spatial precision of three peak detection algorithms with published methods, demonstrating gains in spatial precision when an asymmetric distribution of tags on positive and negative strands is considered. we also analyze the relationship between the depth of sequencing and characteristics of the detected binding positions, and provide a method for estimating the sequencing depth necessary for a desired coverage of protein binding sites.
characterization of ig gene somatic hypermutation in the absence of activation-induced cytidine deaminase1 the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (aid) gene, specifically expressed in germinal center b cells in mice, is a member of the cytidine deaminase family. we herein report mutations in the human counterpart of aid in patients with the autosomal recessive form of hyper-igm syndrome (higm2). three major abnormalities characterize aid deficiency: (1) the absence of immunoglobulin class switch recombination, (2) the lack of immunoglobulin somatic hypermutations, and (3) lymph node hyperplasia caused by the presence of giant germinal centers. the phenotype observed in higm2 patients (and in aid-/- mice) demonstrates the absolute requirement for aid in several crucial steps of b cell terminal differentiation necessary for efficient antibody responses.
possible involvement of cell surface receptors in sphingosine 1-phosphate-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase in c6 glioma cells. we previously showed that sphingosine 1‐phosphate (spp) acts as a second messenger for tumor necrosis factor α‐induced interleukin‐6 (il‐6) synthesis in osteoblast‐like mc3t3‐e1 cells. in the present study, we further investigated the mechanism of il‐6 synthesis induced by spp in mc3t3‐e1 cells. spp significantly induced p42/p44 mitogen‐activated protein (map) kinase activity. pd98059, an inhibitor of map kinase kinase, suppressed spp‐induced il‐6 synthesis as well as spp‐induced map kinase activation. the patterns of both inhibitions were similar. tmb‐8, an inhibitor of ca2+ mobilization from intracellular ca2+ stores, significantly suppressed the spp‐induced il‐6 synthesis. these results strongly suggest that spp‐induced il‐6 synthesis is mediated via p42/p44 map kinase activation in osteoblast‐like cells and that the spp‐induced il‐6 synthesis is dependent on intracellular ca2+ mobilization.
the ercc1/xpf endonuclease is required for completion of homologous recombination at dna replication forks stalled by inter-strand cross-links abstract interstrand cross-links (icls) make up a unique class of dna lesions in which both strands of the double helix are covalently joined, precluding strand opening during replication and transcription. the repair of dna icls has become a focus of study since icls are recognized as the main cytotoxic lesion inflicted by an array of alkylating compounds used in cancer treatment. as is the case for double-strand breaks, a damage-free homologous copy is essential for the removal of icls in an error-free manner. however, recombination-independent mechanisms may exist to remove icls in an error-prone fashion. we have developed an in vivo reactivation assay that can be used to examine the removal of site-specific mitomycin c-mediated icls in mammalian cells. we found that the removal of the icl from the reporter substrate could take place in the absence of undamaged homologous sequences in repair-proficient cells, suggesting a cross-link repair mechanism that is independent of homologous recombination. systematic analysis of nucleotide excision repair mutants demonstrated the involvement of transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair and a partial requirement for the lesion bypass dna polymerase η encoded by the human polh gene. from these observations, we propose the existence of a recombination-independent and mutagenic repair pathway for the removal of icls in mammalian cells.
motor inhibition and response expectancy: a laplacian erp study the nogo potentials (n2/p3) were studied in a precuing auditory reaction time task in human subjects who had to either perform a button-press response (press condition) or imagine they were performing it (imagine condition). in the full precue condition (the subjects knew in advance which response they had to perform/imagine), in 25% of the trials, a nogo signal instructed the subject not to perform or not to imagine the prepared action. clear n2/p3 components were obtained on nogo trials on the press trials, but also on the imagine ones: the n2 was of similar amplitude in both conditions, whereas the p3 was of smaller amplitude in the imagine condition. the presence of nogo potential in motor imagery is discussed in terms of the functional significance of the n2/p3 complex.
increasing flair signal intensity in the postoperative cavity predicts progression in gross-total resected high-grade gliomas objective to determine if hyperintense fluid in the postsurgical cavity on follow-up fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (flair) sequences can predict progression in gliomas.   material and methods observational study of magnetic resonance imaging signal of fluid within the post-surgical cavity in patients with glioma (grade ii-iv), with surgery and follow-up between 2007 and 2012. qualitative comparison between the signal of fluid in the cavity and of the ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (csf) was performed on flair sequences. fluid in the cavity was classified as isointense or hyperintense compared to csf. double-blind reading was performed. the signal intensity was correlated with tumour progression, assessed using response assessment in neuro-oncology criteria.   results a total of 107 patients were included, of whom 90 had high-grade gliomas. inter-rater agreement was excellent, and intra-rater complete (k=0.94 and 1, p<.001). hyperintense fluid in the resection cavity occurred more commonly (58.9% versus 29.4%, p=.025) and earlier (mean 4.5 versus 9.9 months, p<.001) in high-grade than in low-grade gliomas. hyperintense fluid was associated with progression in high-grade gliomas, with a sensitivity of 65.7% (95%ci, 54.3-75.6%) and a specificity of 70.6% (95%ci, 46.6-87%), and in low-grade gliomas with a sensitivity of 50% (95%ci, 18.7-81.2%), and a specificity of 81.8% (95%ci, 51.1-96%). the positive predictive value of this sign was 90.6% (95%ci, 79.3-96.3%) for high-grade gliomas, and was higher for grade iv (93.2%, 95%ci, 87.3-99.1%) and lower for grade iii (77.8%, 95%ci, 59.6-96%), and low-grade gliomas (60%, 95%ci, 22.9-88.4%). false-positives were identified in 7 patients, due to bleeding or infection. hyperintense fluid in high-grade gliomas preceded progression in 22 patients (30.1%), with a mean of 4.1 months (sd 2.1, 95% ci, 3.2-5), and associated with poorer progression-free survival (mean 6.8 versus 11.7 months, p=.004).   conclusions hyperintense fluid in the resection cavity on follow-up flair sequences occurs more frequently and earlier in high-grade gliomas, and is associated with poorer progression-free survival. hyperintense fluid is associated with disease progression, and can predict the progression of resected gliomas. false-positives due to bleeding and infection can be observed, and are easily recognizable.
a novel heavy metal atpase peptide from prosopis juliflora is involved in metal uptake in yeast and tobacco athma1 is a member of the heavy metal-transporting atpase family. it exhibits amino acid sequence similarity to two other zn(ii) transporters, athma2 and athma4, and contains poly-his motifs that are commonly found in zn(ii)-binding proteins, but lacks some amino acids that are typical for this class of transporters. athma1 localizes to the chloroplast envelope. in comparison with wild-type plants, we observed a more pronounced sensitivity in the presence of high zn(ii) concentrations, and increased accumulation of zn in the chloroplast of t-dna insertional mutants in athma1. the zn(ii)-sensitive phenotype of athma1 knock-out plants was complemented by the expression of athma1 under the control of its own promoter. the zn(ii)-transporting activity of athma1 was confirmed in a heterologous expression system, saccharomyces cerevisiae. the sensitivity of yeast to high concentrations of zn(ii) was altered by the expression of athma1 lacking its n-terminal chloroplast-targeting signal. taken together, these results suggest that under conditions of excess zn(ii), athma1 contributes to zn(ii) detoxification by reducing the zn content of arabidopsis thaliana plastids.
the heterozygous abp1/abp1 insertional mutant has defects in functions requiring polar auxin transport and in regulation of early auxin-regulated genes. summarywhen low concentrations (e.g. 10-6 m) of labelled 3-indoleacetic acid (14c-iaa) or α-naphthaleneacetic acid (14c-naa) are added in vitro to homogenates of corn coleoptiles, radioactivity is reversibly bound to pelletable particles. from the saturation kinetics of the binding it is possible to estimate an apparent km between 10-6 m and 10-5 m and a concentration of specific sites of 10-7–10-6 m per tissue volume.the binding is auxin-specific. among many compounds tested, only auxins and such auxin analogues that are known to interact directly with auxin in transport and/or growth were found to interfere with this binding. for instance, the growth-active d-dichlorophenoxyisopropionic acid at 10-4 m inhibits 14c-naa binding more than the less active l-isomer.the auxin-binding fractions are practically free of dna and cytochrome-c oxidase and contain binding sites for 1-naphthylphthalamic acid. the results are discussed in context with the hyothesis—derived mainly from physiological data—that auxin receptors are localized at the plasma membrane.
cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin e complex is involved in p120 catenin (p120ctn)-dependent cell growth control: a new role for p120ctn in cancer. the abnormally high number of centrosomes found in many human tumor cells can lead directly to aneuploidy and genomic instability through the formation of multipolar mitotic spindles. to facilitate investigation of the mechanisms that control centrosome reproduction, a frog egg extract arrested in s phase of the cell cycle that supported repeated assembly of daughter centrosomes was developed. multiple rounds of centrosome reproduction were blocked by selective inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2-cyclin e (cdk2-e) and were restored by addition of purified cdk2-e. confocal immunomicroscopy revealed that cyclin e was localized at the centrosome. these results demonstrate that cdk2-e activity is required for centrosome duplication during s phase and suggest a mechanism that could coordinate centrosome reproduction with cycles of dna synthesis and mitosis.
markov logic for machine reading this note describes a scoring scheme for the coreference task in muc6. it improves on the original approach by: (1) grounding the scoring scheme in terms of a model; (2) producing more intuitive recall and precision scores; and (3) not requiring explicit computation of the transitive closure of coreference. the principal conceptual difference is that we have moved from a syntactic scoring model based on following coreference links to an approach defined by the model theory of those links.
different transcriptional control of metabolism and extracellular matrix in visceral and subcutaneous fat of obese and rimonabant treated mice aim/hypothesisthe distinct metabolic properties of visceral and subcutaneous adipocytes may be due to inherent characteristics of the cells that are resident in each fat depot. to test this hypothesis, human adipocytes were differentiated in vitro from precursor stromal cells obtained from visceral and subcutaneous fat depots and analysed for genetic, biochemical and metabolic endpoints.methodsstromal cells were isolated from adipose tissue depots of nondiabetic individuals. mrna levels of adipocyte-specific proteins were determined by real-time rt-pcr. insulin signalling was evaluated by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. glucose transport was measured by a 2-deoxy-glucose uptake assay. adiponectin secretion in the adipocyte-conditioned medium was determined by a specific ria.resultswith cell differentiation, mrna levels of pparg, c/ebpα (also known as cebpa), ap2 (also known as gtf3a), glut4 (also known as slc2a4) were markedly upregulated, whereas glut1 (also known as slc2a1) mrna did not change. however, expression of c/ebpα, ap2 and adiponectin was higher in subcutaneous than in visceral adipocytes. by contrast, adiponectin was secreted at threefold higher rates by visceral than by subcutaneous adipocytes while visceral adipocytes also showed two- to threefold higher insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. insulin-induced phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, irs proteins, akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 was more rapid and tended to decrease at earlier time-points in visceral than in subcutaneous adipocytes.conclusions/interpretationsubcutaneous and visceral adipocytes, also when differentiated in vitro from precursor stromal cells, retain differences in gene expression, adiponectin secretion, and insulin action and signalling. thus, the precursor cells that reside in the visceral and subcutaneous fat depots may already possess inherent and specific metabolic characteristics that will be expressed upon completion of the differentiation programme.
first-order complete and computationally complete query languages for spatio-temporal databases in this paper, we study the expressive power and the complexity of first-order logic with arithmetic, as a query language over relational and constraint databases. we consider constraints over various domains (n, z, q, and r), and with various arithmetical operations (⩽, +, ×, etc.).    we first consider the data complexity of first-order queries. we prove in particular that linear queries can be evaluated in ac0 over finite integer databases, and in nc1 over linear constraint databases. this improves previously known bounds. we also show that over all domains, enough arithmetic lead to arithmetical queries, therefore, showing the frontiers of constraints for database purposes.    we then tackle the problem of the expressive power, with the definability of the parity and the connectivity, which are the most classical examples of queries not expressible in first-order logic over finite structures. we prove that these two queries are first-order definable in the presence of (enough) arithmetic. nevertheless, we show that they are not definable with constraints of interest for constraint databases such as linear constraints for instance. finally, we developed reduction techniques for queries over constraint databases, that allow us to draw conclusions with respect to their undefinability in various constraint query languages.
activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor by carcinogenic aromatic amines and modulatory effects of their n-acetylated metabolites arylamines and heterocyclic arylamines (haas) are of particular interest because of demonstrated carcinogenicity in animals and humans and the broad exposure to many of these compounds. the activation of these, and also some arylamine drugs, involves n-hydroxylation, usually by cytochrome p450 (p450). p450 1a2 plays a prominent role in these reactions. however, p450 1a1 and 1b1 and other p450s are also important in humans as well as experimental animals. some arylamines (including drugs) are n-hydroxylated predominantly by p450s other than those in family 1. other oxygenases can also have roles. an important issue is extrapolation between species in predicting cancer risks, as shown by the low rates of haa activation by rat p450 1a2 and low levels of p450 1a2 expression in some nonhuman primates.
the molecular characterization of porcine egg precursor cells. abstract tor is a serine-threonine kinase that was originally identified as a target of rapamycin in saccharomyces cerevisiae and then found to be highly conserved among eukaryotes. in drosophila melanogaster, inactivation of tor or its substrate, s6 kinase, results in reduced cell size and embryonic lethality, indicating a critical role for the tor pathway in cell growth control. however, the in vivo functions of mammalian tor (mtor) remain unclear. in this study, we disrupted the kinase domain of mouse mtor by homologous recombination. while heterozygous mutant mice were normal and fertile, homozygous mutant embryos died shortly after implantation due to impaired cell proliferation in both embryonic and extraembryonic compartments. homozygous blastocysts looked normal, but their inner cell mass and trophoblast failed to proliferate in vitro. deletion of the c-terminal six amino acids of mtor, which are essential for kinase activity, resulted in reduced cell size and proliferation arrest in embryonic stem cells. these data show that mtor controls both cell size and proliferation in early mouse embryos and embryonic stem cells.
functional outcomes after arthroscopic treatment of lateral epicondylitis background there are several alternative indicators of income information, which is a fundamental measure of individual socioeconomic position. in this study, we compared the degrees of associations of four types of income information with health variables among japanese adults. methods using a nationally representative sample of 29,446 men and 32,917 women aged 20 years and over, the associations between four income indicators and health variables were examined using the odds ratio in logistic regression analysis and the concentration index by sex and age group (20-59 years and 60+ years). income indicators consisted of total household income, equivalent household income, total household expenditure, and equivalent household expenditure. current smoking and self-rated health statuses were used as health variables. results a low income was associated with a high prevalence of smoking and fair/poor self-rated health, with some differences among sex and age groups and income indicators, but less difference among methods of statistical analyses. total and equivalent incomes were similarly and more markedly associated with smoking and self-rated health statuses, whereas equivalent expenditure showed the smallest degree of health difference. for the population aged 60+ years, the degree of health differences in smoking was similar between income and expenditure. conclusions although the degree of income-related health differences is dependent on health outcome and both sex and age group, this study suggests that either crude or equivalent household income is a useful indicator for health inequality among japanese adults.
impairment of age estimation from faces in alzheimer's disease. an own-age bias in age estimation of faces. evelyne moyse university of li`ege serge br´ edart university of li`ege abstract: the occurrence of an own-age bias on age estimation of faces was assessed by comparing children (10-14), young (20-30) and older (65-75) adults’ performances. participants from each age group estimated both in-group and out-group faces. overall, the age of children’s faces was more accurately estimated than the age of both young and older adult faces. moreover, the age of young adult faces was more accurately estimated than that of older adults. a significant ”age of participants” x ”age of face stimuli” interaction was revealed. although we did not observe a crossed interaction where each age group would have been more accurate for in-group estimation than for out-group estimation, present results reveal the occurrence of an own-age bias in age estimation. there was no significant difference between the three groups when estimating child faces, but young and older adults were more accurate for in-group estimation than the other groups of participants.
ptdins4p synthesis by pi4kiiiα at the plasma membrane and its impact on plasma membrane identity abstract the stt4 phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase has been shown to generate a pool of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (pi4p) at the plasma membrane, critical for actin cytoskeleton organization and cell viability. to further understand the essential role of stt4-mediated pi4p production, we performed a genetic screen using the stt4ts mutation to identify candidate regulators and effectors of pi4p. from this analysis, we identified several genes that have been previously implicated in lipid metabolism. in particular, we observed synthetic lethality when both sphingolipid and pi4p synthesis were modestly diminished. consistent with these data, we show that the previously characterized phosphoinositide effectors, slm1 and slm2, which regulate actin organization, are also necessary for normal sphingolipid metabolism, at least in part through regulation of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, which binds directly to both proteins. additionally, we identify isc1, an inositol phosphosphingolipid phospholipase c, as an additional target of slm1 and slm2 negative regulation. together, our data suggest that slm1 and slm2 define a molecular link between phosphoinositide and sphingolipid signaling and thereby regulate actin cytoskeleton organization.
minipig model of maxillary distraction osteogenesis: immunohistochemical and histomorphometric analysis of the sequence of osteogenesis. the theoretic advantage of distraction osteogenesis of the craniofacial skeleton, especially in cases of severe midface retrusion and in the presence of maxillary scarring, is prevention of relapse following significant advancements. the purpose of this study is to demonstrate the utility of a new low-profile, intraoral, internal device for midface distraction at the conventional or high le fort i level. in addition, the present study compares the efficacy of immediate versus delayed distraction on subsequent maxillary relapse. four adult rhesus macaca mulatta monkeys were divided into two groups. group 1 underwent immediate midface distraction; group 2 underwent delayed distraction. all four monkeys underwent a modified le fort i osteotomy through an upper buccal sulcus incision and bilateral application of the intraoral midface distraction devices. no other osteotomies or incisions were necessary. immediate distraction, performed in group 1, entailed intraoperative activation of the devices and distraction of 10 mm followed by a 5-day lag period before postoperative activation and distraction of an additional 10 mm at the rate of 1 mm/day. delayed distraction, performed in group 2, entailed a 5-day postoperative lag period before device activation and distraction of 20 mm at the rate of 1 mm/day. both groups thus underwent 20 mm of midface distraction. all devices were removed 6 weeks after completion of distraction. all monkeys tolerated the devices and daily distraction uneventfully. on the basis of serial cephalograms and dental models obtained throughout the experimental period, there was no evidence of relapse in either the immediate or delayed groups 6 months after distraction. in addition, on the basis of histologic, ultrastructural, and dry skull analysis, no significant differences were observed in the quality of regenerate bone obtained when comparing the immediate and delayed distraction groups. significant midface advancement is thus feasible using this new internal, intraoral distraction device, which presents several advantages over other internal devices that require coronal incisions and additional osteotomies to achieve midface advancement. in addition, immediate distraction may abbreviate the distraction period without adverse sequelae.
van der woude syndrome in twins by three pedigree and statistical criteria van der woude syndrome (vws) appears to have been underreported and frequently not diagnosed. eight percent of gene carriers are not diagnosed because they are nonpenetrant. but among penetrant gene carriers as many as 80% may not have been recognized in the past. a direct estimate of incidence of vws is 3.6/100,000 births; indirect estimates are more than double that. the relative risk of inheriting a cleft from an affected parent is 22.43%; the risk of inheriting lip pits only, or being nonpenetrant is 27.57%. (this corrects a similar statement in the abstract of burdick et al [j craniofacial genet dev biol 5:181-208, 1985], which was incorrectly calculated). the idea of unitary control of the action of the vws gene in the three target tissues appears not to be supported. rather, we tend to support the idea that the gene is controlled independently in the three tissues. indications of a family at risk are listed and discussed.
profile of atherosclerotic risk factors and management in patients of peripheral arterial disease at a tertiary care teaching hospital of north india background previous investigators have observed a doubling of the mortality rate among patients with intermittent claudication, and we have reported a fourfold increase in the overall mortality rate among subjects with large-vessel peripheral arterial disease, as diagnosed by noninvasive testing. in this study, we investigated the association of large-vessel peripheral arterial disease with rates of mortality from all cardiovascular diseases and from coronary heart disease.   methods we examined 565 men and women (average age, 66 years) for the presence of large-vessel peripheral arterial disease by means of two noninvasive techniques--measurement of segmental blood pressure and determination of flow velocity by doppler ultrasound. we identified 67 subjects with the disease (11.9 percent), whom we followed prospectively for 10 years.   results twenty-one of the 34 men (61.8 percent) and 11 of the 33 women (33.3 percent) with large-vessel peripheral arterial disease died during follow-up, as compared with 31 of the 183 men (16.9 percent) and 26 of the 225 women (11.6 percent) without evidence of peripheral arterial disease. after multivariate adjustment for age, sex, and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, the relative risk of dying among subjects with large-vessel peripheral arterial disease as compared with those with no evidence of such disease was 3.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.9 to 4.9) for deaths from all causes, 5.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 3.0 to 11.4) for all deaths from cardiovascular disease, and 6.6 (95 percent confidence interval, 2.9 to 14.9) for deaths from coronary heart disease. the relative risk of death from causes other than cardiovascular disease was not significantly increased among the subjects with large-vessel peripheral arterial disease. after the exclusion of subjects who had a history of cardiovascular disease at base line, the relative risks among those with large-vessel peripheral arterial disease remained significantly elevated. additional analyses revealed a 15-fold increase in rates of mortality due to cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease among subjects with large-vessel peripheral arterial disease that was both severe and symptomatic.   conclusions patients with large-vessel peripheral arterial disease have a high risk of death from cardiovascular causes.
ipsilateral cortical activation in fibromyalgia patients during brushing correlates with symptom severity objective: to investigate cerebral activations underlying touch-evoked pain (dynamic–mechanical allodynia) in patients with neuropathic pain. methods: fmri was used in 12 patients with complex regional pain syndromes (crpss). allodynia was elicited by gently brushing the affected crps hand. elicited pain ratings were recorded online to obtain pain-weighted predictors. both activations and deactivations of blood oxygenation level–dependent signals were investigated. results: nonpainful stimulation on the nonaffected hand activated contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (s1), bilateral insula, and secondary somatosensory cortices (s2). in contrast, allodynia led to widespread cerebral activations, including contralateral s1 and motor cortex (m1), parietal association cortices (pa), bilateral s2, insula, frontal cortices, and both anterior and posterior parts of the cingulate cortex (aacc and pacc). deactivations were detected in the visual, vestibular, and temporal cortices. when rating-weighted predictors were implemented, only few activations remained (s1/pa cortex, bilateral s2/insular cortices, pacc). conclusions: allodynic stimulation recruits a complex cortical network. activations include not only nociceptive but also motor and cognitive processing. using a covariance approach (i.e., implementation of rating-weighted predictors) facilitates the detection of a neuronal matrix involved in the encoding of allodynia. the pattern of cortical deactivation during allodynia may hint at a shift of activation from tonically active sensory systems, like visual and vestibular cortices, into somatosensory-related brain areas.
genetically engineered frameshifted yopn-tyea chimeras influence type iii secretion system function in yersinia pseudotuberculosis pathogenic yersinia species employ type iii machines to target effector yops into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells. yersinia tyea mutants are thought to be defective in the targeting of yope and yoph without affecting the injection of yopm, yopn, yopo, yopp, and yopt into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells. one model suggests that tyea may form a tether between yopn (lcre) and yopd on the bacterial surface, a structure that may translocate yope and yoph across the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells (m. iriarte, m. p. sory, a. boland, a. p. boyd, s. d. mills, i. lambermont, and g. r. cornelis, embo j. 17:1907-1918, 1998). we have examined the injection of yop proteins by tyea mutant yersiniae with the digitonin fractionation technique. we find that tyea mutant yersiniae not only secreted yope, yoph, yopm, and yopn into the extracellular medium but also targeted these polypeptides into the cytosol of hela cells. protease protection, cell fractionation, and affinity purification experiments suggest that tyea is located intracellularly and binds to yopn or yopd. we propose a model whereby tyea functions as a negative regulator of the type iii targeting pathway in the cytoplasm of yersiniae, presumably by preventing the export of yopn.
multiple site silicon-based probes for chronic recordings in freely moving rats: implantation, recording and histological verification the contribution of the various hippocampal regions to the maintenance of epileptic activity, induced by stimulation of the perforant path or commissural system, was examined in the awake rat. combination of multiple-site recordings with silicon probes, current source density analysis and unit recordings allowed for a high spatial resolution of the field events. following perforant path stimulation, seizures began in the dentate gyrus, followed by events in the ca3-ca1 regions. after commissural stimulation, rhythmic bursts in the ca3-ca1 circuitry preceded the activation of the dentate gyrus. correlation of events in the different subregions indicated that the sustained rhythmic afterdischarge (2-6 hz) could not be explained by a cycle-by-cycle excitation of principal cell populations in the hippocampal-entorhinal loop. the primary afterdischarge always terminated in the ca1 region, followed by the dentate gyrus, ca3 region and the entorhinal cortex. the duration and pattern of the hippocampal afterdischarge was essentially unaffected by removal of the entorhinal cortex. the emergence of large population spike bursts coincided with a decreased discharge of interneurons in both ca1 and hilar regions. the majority of hilar interneurons displayed a strong amplitude decrement prior to the onset of population spike phase of the afterdischarge. these findings suggest that (i) afterdischarges can independently arise in the ca3-ca1 and entorhinal dentate gyrus circuitries, (ii) reverberation of excitation in the hippocampal-entorhinal loop is not critical for the maintenance of afterdischarges and (iii) decreased activity of the interneuronal network may release population bursting of principal cells.
dna damage-induced foci of e2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme are detectable upon co-transfection with an interacting e3 ubiquitin ligase dna double-strand breaks (dsbs) not only interrupt the genetic information, but also disrupt the chromatin structure, and both impairments require repair mechanisms to ensure genome integrity. we showed previously that rnf8-mediated chromatin ubiquitylation protects genome integrity by promoting the accumulation of repair factors at dsbs. here, we provide evidence that, while rnf8 is necessary to trigger the dsb-associated ubiquitylations, it is not sufficient to sustain conjugated ubiquitin in this compartment. we identified rnf168 as a novel chromatin-associated ubiquitin ligase with an ability to bind ubiquitin. we show that rnf168 interacts with ubiquitylated h2a, assembles at dsbs in an rnf8-dependent manner, and, by targeting h2a and h2ax, amplifies local concentration of lysine 63-linked ubiquitin conjugates to the threshold required for retention of 53bp1 and brca1. thus, rnf168 defines a new pathway involving sequential ubiquitylations on damaged chromosomes and uncovers a functional cooperation between e3 ligases in genome maintenance.
the rna world as a model system to study the origin of life there is very significant evidence that cognate codons and/or anticodons are unexpectedly frequent in rna-binding sites for seven of eight biological amino acids that have been tested. this suggests that a substantial fraction of the genetic code has a stereochemical basis, the triplets having escaped from their original function in amino acid-binding sites to become modern codons and anticodons. we explicitly show that this stereochemical basis is consistent with subsequent optimization of the code to minimize the effect of coding mistakes on protein structure. these data also strengthen the argument for invention of the genetic code in an rna world and for the rna world itself.
selective contractile dysfunction of left, not right, ventricular myocardium in the shhf rat. myocardial failure in dilated cardiomyopathy may result from subcellular alterations in contractile protein function, excitation-contraction coupling processes, or recovery metabolism. we used isometric force and heat measurements to quantitatively investigate these subcellular systems in intact left ventricular muscle strips from nonfailing human hearts (n = 14) and from hearts with end-stage failing dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 13). in the failing myocardium, peak isometric twitch tension, maximum rate of tension rise, and maximum rate of relaxation were reduced by 46% (p = 0.013), 51% (p = 0.003), and 46% (p = 0.018), respectively (37 degrees c, 60 beats per minute). tension-dependent heat, reflecting the number of crossbridge interactions during the isometric twitch, was reduced by 61% in the failing myocardium (p = 0.006). in terms of the individual crossbridge cycle, the average crossbridge force-time integral was increased by 33% (p = 0.04) in the failing myocardium. in the nonfailing myocardium, the crossbridge force-time integral was positively correlated with the patient's age (r = 0.86, p less than 0.02), whereas there was no significant correlation with age in the failing group. the amount and rate of excitation-contraction coupling-related heat evolution (tension-independent heat) were reduced by 69% (p = 0.24) and 71% (p = 0.028), respectively, in the failing myocardium, reflecting a considerable decrease in the amount of calcium released and in the rate of calcium removal. the efficiency of the metabolic recovery process, as assessed by the ratio of initial heat to total activity-related heat, was similar in failing and nonfailing myocardium (0.54 +/- 0.03 versus 0.50 +/- 0.02, p = 0.23).(abstract truncated at 250 words)
the effect of internal mammary artery grafts on long-term clinical outcomes after coronary bypass surgery objectives the purpose of the present study is to report the five-year follow-up results of the eraci ii trial.   background immediate and one-year follow-up results of the eraci ii study showed a prognosis advantage of percutaneous coronary intervention (pci) with stents over coronary artery bypass grafting (cabg).   methods a total of 450 patients were randomly assigned to undergo either pci (n = 225); or cabg (n = 225). only patients with multi-vessel disease were enrolled. clinical follow-up during five years was obtained in 92% of the total population after hospital discharge. the primary end point of the study was to compare freedom from major adverse cardiovascular events (mace) at 30 days, 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years of follow-up.   results at five years of follow-up, patients initially treated with pci had similar survival and freedom from non-fatal acute myocardial infarction than those initially treated with cabg (92.8% vs. 88.4% and 97.3% vs. 94% respectively, p = 0.16). freedom from repeat revascularization procedures (pci/cabg) was significantly lower with pci compared with cabg (71.5% vs. 92.4%, p = 0.0002). freedom from mace was also significantly lower with pci compared with cabg (65.3% vs. 76.4%; p = 0.013). at five years similar numbers of patients randomized to each revascularization procedure were asymptomatic or with class i angina.   conclusions at five years of follow-up, in the eraci ii study, there were no survival benefits from any revascularization procedure; however patients initially treated with cabg had better freedom from repeat revascularization procedures and from mace.
infusing neuroscience into the study and prevention of drug misuse and co-occurring aggressive behavior stress causes rapid and transient expression of immediate early genes (iegs) in the brain, and the monitoring of iegs has enabled the visualization of the neurocircuitry of stress. previous studies have postulated that stressors can be divided into two categories; processive and systemic. the neural circuits of brain activation differ between the two kinds of stressors. for example, processive stressors, such as immobilization (imo), induce c-fos mrna first in the cortical and limbic areas and then in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (pvh), while c-fos expression in the pvh precedes that in other areas in animals subjected to systemic stressors. we further show that prior exposure to imo stress for 6 days, or implantation of corticosterone pellets suppresses the induction of c-fos, fos b, jun b and ngfi-b, but not that of ngfi-a in the rat pvh. plasma glucocorticoid may be an important factor regulating stress-induced ieg expression. it is well known that ap-1 and glucocorticoid receptors (gr) interact and suppress each other. thus, decreased ap-1 levels in chronically stressed animals may help enhance the negative feedback effects of gr and prevent hypersecretion of glucocorticoid, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of stress-related diseases. imo stress induces rapid expression of c-fos, c-jun and ngfi-a mrnas in the heart and stomach. these were observed in the ventricular myocardium and coronary arteries, and in the epithelium, smooth muscles and arteries of the stomach after 30 min of imo. ieg expression in the peripheral organs may provide a molecular basis for stress-induced psychosomatic disorders.
ameliorative effect of lycopene effect on cisplatin-induced nephropathy in patient background: nephrotoxicity is the major side-effect of cisplatin (cddp), and it is reported to be gender-related. we evaluated the effects of pomegranate flower extract (pfe) as an antioxidant on cddp-induced nephrotoxicity in female rats. methods: twenty-three adult female rats in four groups treated as following. groups 1 and 2 received pfe at doses of 25 and 50 (mg/kg/day), respectively, for 9 days, and from day 3 on, they also received cisplatin (cddp) (2.5 mg/kg) daily. group 3 was treated as group 1 expects saline instead of pfe, and group 4 received pfe (25 mg/kg/day) alone. results: cisplatin alone increased the serum levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and nitrite; and kidney tissue damage score and kidney weight. however, pfe not only did not ameliorate the induced nephrotoxicity, but also aggravated renal tissue damage. conclusions: pomegranate extract as an antioxidant did not ameliorate cddp-induced nephrotoxicity in female rats.
nature and variants of idiopathic restless legs syndrome: observations from 152 patients referred to secondary care in the uk objectives to assess the frequency, impact, and medical response to the restless legs syndrome (rls) in a large multi-national primary care population.   method questionnaire surveys of matched patients and primary care physicians (pcps) in five modern industrialized western countries.   results an rls screening questionnaire was completed by 23,052 patients: 2223 (9.6%) reported weekly rls symptoms; 1557 of these patients had medical follow-up questionnaires completed both by themselves and by their physician. an rls sufferer subgroup (n=551) likely warranting treatment was defined as reporting at least twice weekly symptoms with appreciable negative impact on quality of life. a total of 88.4% of rls sufferers reported at least one sleep-related symptom. most reported impaired sleep consistent with a diagnosis of insomnia. out of 551 sufferers, 357 (64.8%) reported consulting a physician about their rls symptoms, but only 46 of these 357 (12.9%) reported having been given a diagnosis. pcps reported that 209 (37.9%) rls sufferers consulted them about rls symptoms, but only 52 (24.9%) were given an rls diagnosis. in most countries, sufferers, regardless of diagnosis, were prescribed therapies not known to be effective in rls.   conclusions rls significantly impairs patients' lives, often by severely disrupting sleep. the marked under-diagnosis and inappropriate treatment of rls indicates that pcps need better education about this condition. recognizing how often disrupted sleep results from rls should improve diagnosis.
sororin mediates sister chromatid cohesion by antagonizing wapl cohesin's smc1, smc3, and scc1 subunits form a tripartite ring that entraps sister dnas. scc3, pds5, and rad61 (wapl) are regulatory subunits that control this process. we describe here smc3, scc3, pds5, and rad61 mutations that permit yeast cell proliferation and entrapment of sister dnas by cohesin rings in the absence of eco1, an acetyl transferase normally essential for establishing sister chromatid cohesion. the smc3 mutations cluster around and include a highly conserved lysine (k113) close to smc3's atp-binding pocket, which, together with k112, is acetylated by eco1. lethality caused by mutating both residues to arginine is suppressed by the scc3, pds5, and rad61 mutants. scc3, pds5, and rad61 form a complex and inhibit entrapment of sister dnas by a process involving the "k112/k113" surface on smc3's atpase. according to this model, eco1 promotes sister dna entrapment partly by relieving an antiestablishment activity associated with scc3, pds5, and rad61.
toxico-pathological changes induced by cypermethrin in broiler chicks: their attenuation with vitamin e and selenium. this study was carried out on 90 one-day-old broiler chicks to know clinico-hematological alterations, dna damage caused by cypermethrin (cy), and attenuation of toxic effects by vitamin e (vit e) and selenium (se). birds were randomly divided into five equal groups. groups 1-4 received cy (600mlkg(-1)b.wt) daily for 30 days by crop tubing. in addition to cy, groups 2, 3 and 4 received vit e (150mgkg(-1)b.wt), se (0.25mgkg(-1)b.wt), and vit e (150mgkg(-1)b.wt)+se (0.25mgkg(-1)b.wt), respectively. group 5 served as control. birds were monitored twice daily for clinical signs. they were weighed and blood samples were collected at experimental days 10, 20 and 30 for hematological studies. cy-treated birds showed more prominent signs of toxicity compared to cy+vit e, cy+se and cy+vit e+se birds. body weight in groups 1-3 was significantly (p<0.05) smaller at days 20 and 30 when compared with the control group. significantly (p<0.001) higher numbers of micronuclei appeared in chicks treated with cy compared to cy+vit e- and cy+se-treated birds. significantly decreased total erythrocyte counts (tec), hemoglobin (hb) concentration and packed cell volume (pcv) in all treated groups were recorded. treated birds suffered from macrocytic hypochromic anemia. leukocytosis in early stage and later leucopenia was seen in treated birds. it can be concluded that cy induces toxic effects in broilers chicks; however, these toxic effects can be ameliorated by vit e or se. combination of vit e and se was more effective to ameliorate toxic effects of cypermethrin.
coil-assisted rfa of poorly visible liver tumors: effectiveness and risk factors of local tumor progression new techniques of ct-guided management were introduced to ablate ultrasonically invisible hepatocellular carcinomas. in six patients with hcc, a total of six nodules (8–30 mm in diameter) were treated under the guidance of ct. these lesions were not visualized by sonography but were visualized as lipiodol spots on ct after chemoembolization. tumor localization was successful in all patients without difficulty, using a thin needle or hookwire under the guidance of ct. two patients underwent subsequent hepatic resection and/or microwave coagulation therapy (mct) through a small incision after hookwire placement. four patients received percutaneous mct (n = 2) or ethanol injection (pei) (n = 2) at the time of localization. the postoperative ct with contrast enhancement indicated that tumor ablation was complete in four of the five nodules treated with mct or pei. however, in one nodule (30 mm in diameter) treated with pei, tumor ablation was not complete. there were no complications. there has been no local tumor recurrence 6–46 months after treatment in any of the patients. in conclusion, these ct-guided procedures were effective in treating ultrasonically invisible hepatocellular carcinomas that otherwise would have remained untreated.
histopathologic correlation of aspergillus endophthalmitis following uncomplicated cataract surgery purpose to report a series of patients with early onset aspergillus endophthalmitis following cataract surgery.   design retrospective consecutive case series.   methods medical records were reviewed of all cases of endophthalmitis caused by aspergillus after cataract surgery treated at the authors' practices between 1992 and 2005.   results five patients were identified. two patients were immunocompromised (one on oral corticosteroids and one on chemotherapy for lung cancer). the mean number of days between cataract surgery and diagnosis with endophthalmitis was 29 (range, 10 to 62 days). three eyes (60%) were enucleated despite a variety of treatments. in addition to vitrectomy and injection of antifungal agents, the other two eyes underwent surgical debridement of a localized necrotic nidus. final visual acuity was 20/30 in one eye and 20/200 in the remaining eye.   conclusions aspergillus should be considered in the differential diagnosis of early onset endophthalmitis following cataract surgery. visual outcomes are generally poor and enucleation is common in these patients.
nonsense mediated decay resistant mutations are a source of expressed mutant proteins in colon cancer cell lines with microsatellite instability high level microsatellite instability (msi-h) occurs in about 15% of colorectal cancer (crcs), either as sporadic cancers or in the context of hereditary non-polyposis cancer or lynch syndrome. in msi-h crc, mismatch repair deficiency leads to insertion/deletion mutations at coding microsatellites and thus to the translation of frameshift peptides (fsps). fsps are potent inductors of t cell responses in vitro and in vivo. the present study aims at the identification of fsp-specific humoral immune responses in msi-h crc and lynch syndrome. sera from patients with history of msi-h crc (n = 69), healthy lynch syndrome mutation carriers (n = 31) and healthy controls (n = 52) were analyzed for antibodies against fsps using peptide elisa. reactivities were measured against fsps derived from genes frequently mutated in msi-h crcs, aim2, tgfbr2, casp5, taf1b, znf294, and marcks. antibody reactivity against fsps was significantly higher in msi-h crc patients than in healthy controls (p = 0.036, mann–whitney) and highest in patients with shortest interval between tumor resection and serum sampling. humoral immune responses in patients were most frequently directed against fsps derived from mutated taf1b (11.6%, 8/69) and tgfbr2 (10.1%, 7/69). low level fsp-specific antibodies were also detected in healthy mutation carriers. our results show that antibody responses against fsps are detectable in msi-h crc patients and healthy lynch syndrome mutation carriers. based on the high number of defined fsp antigens, measuring fsp-specific humoral immune responses is a highly promising tool for future diagnostic application in msi-h cancer patients.
amniotic fluid chemokines and autism spectrum disorders: an exploratory study utilizing a danish historic birth cohort background the danish medical birth registry (mbr) was established in 1968 and has been computerized since 1973. the primary purpose of the registration is to monitor the health of the newborns and of the quality of the antenatal and delivery care services, but the registry is increasingly being used in research. major changes in registration have taken place in 1978 and 1991. the paper describes the content and usage of the mbr over time and suggests research topics for the future.   results a broad scope of studies illustrates how the mbr has been used, either as single data source, linked with data from other registries or with data from interviews or self-completed questionnaires. validations have shown variations in the quality of data, depending on source, and have underlined the need for constant quality control. any access to data at the individual level is subjected to special provisions laid down by the data surveillance authority and also requires a permission from the national board of health.   conclusions the time from conception to early childhood is an important period concerning future health for the individual. the danish medical birth registry is a valuable tool in this respect, which has not yet been used to its full potential in research or monitoring. experience indicates that the quality of the registry depends upon having a close link to the staff responsible for delivery services and thus having the necessary specialised skills and interest.
transgenic cotton plants expressing double-stranded rnas target hmg-coa reductase (hmgr) gene inhibits the growth, development and survival of cotton bollworms abstract transgenic maize, zea mays l., event tc1507 produces the cry1f protein to provide protection from feeding by several important lepidopteran pests, including spodoptera frugiperda (j.e. smith) (lepidoptera: noctuidae). reports of reduced field performance against this species in puerto rico were investigated, and laboratory bioassays showed that s. frugiperda collected from the affected area exhibited lower sensitivity to the cry1f protein compared with typical colonies from other regions. the resistance was shown to be autosomally inherited and highly recessive. the puerto rico colony was shown to be moderately less sensitive than susceptible laboratory strains to cry1ab and cry1ac, but the differences in sensitivity were dramatically smaller than for cry1f. potential contributory factors to the emergence of resistance to cry1f in puerto rico populations of s. frugiperda include the tropical island geography, unusually large population sizes in 2006, and drought conditions reducing the availability of alternative hosts. in response to this resistance incident, the technology providers have stopped commercial sales of tc1507 maize in puerto rico pending potential reversion to susceptibility.
effect of bovine somatotropin on the lactational and reproductive performance of lactating dairy cows - a review the galactopoietic effect of daily injections, for five day periods, of growth hormone was examined by measuring milk yield, mammary blood flow and arteriovenous differences of glucose and amino acids on 12 occasions in four goats. in 10 periods there were marked increases (mean 18.1%) in mammary blood flow (8 statistically significant) and less-marked increases (mean 8.0%) in milk yield (6 statistically significant). on 8 of the occasions on which it was measured the maximum blood plasma growth hormone concentration was increased to more than 8 ng/ml. there were no statistically significant changes in mammary arteriovenous concentration differences of glucose or amino acids in response to growth hormone injections. it is suggested that, contrary to the usual situation in which the rate of mammary blood flow appears to be regulated by the metabolic activity of the gland, the galactopoietic response to growth hormone may be a consequence of elevated blood flow, which increases the supply to the gland of rate-limiting metabolic substrates.
the sushi domains of gabab receptors function as axonal targeting signals little is known about presynaptic assembly during central nervous system synaptogenesis. here we used time-lapse fluorescence imaging, immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy to study hippocampal neuronal cultures transfected with a fusion construct of the presynaptic vesicle protein vamp and green fluorescent protein. our results suggest that major cytoplasmic and membrane-associated protein precursors of the presynaptic active zone are transported along developing axons together as discrete packets. retrospective electron microscopy demonstrated varied vesicular and tubulovesicular membrane structures. packets containing these heterogeneous structures were stabilized specifically at new sites of dendrite- and axon-initiated cell–cell contact; within less than one hour, evoked vesicle recycling was observed at these putative nascent synapses. these observations suggest that substantial membrane remodeling may be necessary to produce the uniform vesicles typical of the mature active zone, and that many presynaptic proteins may be united early in their biogenesis and sorting pathways.
neural substrates of abstinence-induced cigarette cravings in chronic smokers most advances in addiction treatment to date have addressed the physical dependence and withdrawal that accompany addiction to some drugs of abuse. in contrast, it has proven more difficult to develop medications that effectively treat drug craving and relapse, the core features of addictive disorders. current efforts focus on developing medications that prevent a drug from getting to its protein target, that mimic drug action and thereby partially alleviate drug craving, or that affect the addiction process per se. the latter approach is the most speculative, but also the most promising in terms of translating basic knowledge of addiction into clinical progress.
genetic characterization of porcine circovirus type 2 from pigs with porcine circovirus associated diseases in argentina neonatal gnotobiotic piglets were inoculated with tissue homogenates and low- and high-passage cell culture material to determine if the lesions of the newly described porcine postweaning multi-systemic wasting syndrome (pmws) could be reproduced. for this, 17 3-day-old gnotobiotic piglets were inoculated intranasally with pelleted chloroform-treated, filtered extracts from cell cultures, filter-sterilized homogenates of lymphoid tissue from pmws-affected piglets, or control materials. piglets were maintained in germ-free isolators for up to 5 weeks after infection prior to euthanasia and collection of samples for analysis. all piglets inoculated with the viral inocula developed lesions typical of pmws, including generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatitis, nephritis, interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis, and gastritis. porcine circovirus (pcv), as well as porcine parvovirus (ppv), was detected in tissues by virus reisolation, polymerase chain reaction analysis, or immunohistochemistry. all infected piglets developed moderate to high titers of antibody to pcv and moderate titers to ppv. no lesions, virus, or virus-specific antibodies were detected in sham-inoculated or uninoculated control piglets. these studies demonstrate that the lesions of pmws can be experimentally reproduced in gnotobiotic piglets using filterable viral agents derived from pigs with pmws and provide an experimental basis for further investigation into the pathogenesis and control of this emerging infectious disease in swine.
crossing the impassable: genetic connections in 20 reef fishes across the eastern pacific barrier intraspecific gene evolution cannot always be represented by a bifurcating tree. rather, population genealogies are often multifurcated, descendant genes coexist with persistent ancestors and recombination events produce reticulate relationships. whereas traditional phylogenetic methods assume bifurcating trees, several networking approaches have recently been developed to estimate intraspecific genealogies that take into account these population-level phenomena.
length of mitotic arrest induced by microtubule-stabilizing drugs determines cell death after mitotic exit the spindle checkpoint that monitors kinetochore–microtubule attachment has been implicated in tumorigenesis; however, the relation between the spindle checkpoint and cell death remains obscure. in bub1-deficient (but not mad2-deficient) cells, conditions that activate the spindle checkpoint (i.e., cold shock or treatment with nocodazole, paclitaxel, or 17-aag) induced dna fragmentation during early mitosis. this mitotic cell death was independent of caspase activation; therefore, we named it caspase-independent mitotic death (cimd). cimd depends on p73, a homologue of p53, but not on p53. cimd also depends on apoptosis-inducing factor and endonuclease g, which are effectors of caspase-independent cell death. treatment with nocodazole, paclitaxel, or 17-aag induced cimd in cell lines derived from colon tumors with chromosome instability, but not in cells from colon tumors with microsatellite instability. this result was due to low bub1 expression in the former cell lines. when bub1 is completely depleted, aneuploidy rather than cimd occurs. these results suggest that cells prone to substantial chromosome missegregation might be eliminated via cimd.
the ubiquitous isoform of na/k-atpase (atp1a1) regulates junctional proteins, connexin 43 and claudin 11 via src-egfr-erk1/2-creb pathway in rat sertoli cells† in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (adpkd), cyst formation and enlargement require proliferation of mural renal epithelial cells and the transepithelial secretion of fluid into the cyst cavity. na,k-atpase is essential for solute and water transport in adpkd cells, and ouabain blocks fluid secretion in these cells. by binding to the na,k-atpase, ouabain also induces proliferation in some cell types. surprisingly, it was found that nanomolar concentrations of ouabain, similar to those circulating in blood, induced adpkd cell proliferation but had no statistically significant effect on normal human kidney (nhk) cells. ouabain, acting from the basolateral side of the cells, also caused an increase in the level of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (erk). mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (mek) inhibitor u0126 blocked ouabain-induced erk activation and cell proliferation, suggesting that ouabain effect is mediated through the mek-erk pathway. in contrast to nhk cells, the dose-response curve for ouabain inhibition of na,k-atpase activity indicated that approximately 20% of the enzyme in adpkd cells exhibits a higher affinity for ouabain. the increased ouabain affinity of adpkd cells was not due to differences in na,k-atpase isoform expression because these cells, like nhk cells, possess only the alpha1 and beta1 subunits. the gamma variants of the na,k-atpase also are expressed in the cells but are elevated in adpkd cells. currently, the basis for the differences in ouabain sensitivity of nhk and adpkd cells is unknown. it is concluded that ouabain stimulates proliferation in adpkd cells by binding to the na,k-atpase with high affinity and via activation of the mek-erk pathway.
phenotype–genotype interactions on renal function in type 2 diabetes: an analysis using structural equation modelling cytokine‐induced inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (dm). we investigated plasma concentrations and ex vivo production of cytokines and chemokines, and intracellular signalling molecules, mitogen‐activated protein kinases (mapk) in t helper (th) cells and monocytes in 94 type 2 diabetic patients with or without nephropathy and 20 healthy controls. plasma concentrations of inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor (tnf)‐α, interleukin (il)‐6, il‐18 and chemokine ccl2 in patients with diabetic nephropathy (dn) were significantly higher than control subjects, while il‐10, cxcl8, cxcl9, cxcl10 and adiponectin concentrations of dn were significantly higher than patients without diabetic nephropathy (ndn) and control subjects (all p < 0·05). plasma concentrations of tnf‐α, il‐6, il‐10, il‐18, ccl2, cxcl8, cxcl9, cxcl10 and adiponectin exhibited significant positive correlation with urine albumin : creatinine ratio in dn patients. the percentage increases of ex vivo production of il‐6, cxcl8, cxcl10, ccl2 and ccl5 upon tnf‐α activation were significantly higher in both ndn and dn patients than controls (all p < 0·05). the percentage increases in il‐18‐induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal‐regulated kinase (erk) in th cells of ndn and dn were significantly higher than controls (p < 0·05), while the percentage increase in tnf‐α‐induced phosphorylation of p38 mapk in monocytes and il‐18‐induced phosphorylation of p38 mapk in th cells and monocytes were significantly higher in ndn patients than controls. these results confirmed that the aberrant production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and differential activation of mapk in different leucocytes are the underlying immunopathological mechanisms of type 2 dm patients with dn.
laser-assisted three-dimensional surface modifications of titanium implants: preliminary data purpose titanium endosseous implants are becoming increasingly important in dentistry because of their excellent long-term results. however, it has been reported that these implants may lead to higher concentrations of titanium, especially in the lungs and kidneys. the purpose of this study, therefore, was to determine whether co2 laser-assisted decontamination of exposed implant surfaces is associated with an increase in titanium release.   materials and methods in 6 beagle dogs, a total of 60 implants were placed. after osseointegration and second-stage surgery, peri-implantitis was induced by cotton floss ligatures for 12 weeks. surgical treatment consisted of granulation tissue removal, including decontamination of the implant surface with 3 different methods. twenty implants were decontaminated conventionally by an air-powder abrasive for 60 seconds. another 20 implants were decontaminated by laser treatment alone. the last 20 implants were treated conventionally by air-powder abrasive and then lased. four months later, fresh tissue samples of various tissues were evaluated by histologic and chemical analysis.   results quantitative analysis indicated that titanium accumulation could be detected, especially in the spleen, liver, oral mucosa, regional lymph nodes, lung, and kidney in the beagle dog model.   discussion the concentrations found did not exceed those previously reported in the literature.   conclusion these results support the hypothesis that co2 laser-assisted therapy of ailing implants will not result in excessive titanium concentrations in tissues. accordingly, co2 lasers appear suitable and safe for peri-implant gingival surgery.
retinal amino acid neurochemistry in health and disease excitation mapping is a method of visualizing the signaling history of neurons with permeant organic cations. it is compatible with high-resolution imaging, allowing concurrent visualization of all neuronal classes and their glutamate-gated excitation histories. excitation mapping documents the stability and precision of neuronal signaling within a given neuronal class, arguing that single unit electrophysiological sampling accurately reflects neuronal diversity. we here review the theory of excitation mapping, provide methods and protocol links; outline imaging concepts; provide parametric data on the temporal range and physiological sensitivity of excitation mapping; and show that immunocytochemical methods for macromolecules are compatible with excitation mapping.
low-dose dipyridamole infusion acutely increases exercise capacity in angina pectoris: a double-blind, placebo controlled crossover stress echocardiographic study. background coronary steal is defined as a fall in blood flow toward a certain vascular region in favor of another area during arteriolar vasodilatation, ie, a coronary flow velocity reserve (cfvr) <1. the purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of steal in patients with a wide range of collateral supply to a vascular area of interest and to assess whether steal is associated with the amount of collateral flow.   methods and results one hundred patients 57+/-9 years old with a coronary artery stenosis to be dilated were examined with intracoronary (ic) doppler guidewires. ic adenosine-induced cfvr<1 obtained distal to the stenosis was defined as steal. an index for collateral flow was determined by positioning the doppler guidewire in the collateral-dependent vessel distal to the stenosis and measuring the flow velocity time integral during (vi(occl), cm) and after (vi(ø-occl)) balloon occlusion. vi(occl)/vi(ø-occl) was determined without and with intravenous adenosine (140 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)). coronary steal occurred in 10 of 100 patients. patients with steal showed superior collaterals compared with those without steal: vi(occl)/vi(ø-occl)=0.65+/-0.24 in patients with steal versus 0.29+/-0.18 in those without steal (p=.0001). in all patients with steal, there was a reduction in collateral flow during intravenous adenosine-induced hyperemia, whereas in the majority (70%) of patients without steal, collateral flow increased or remained unchanged during hyperemia.   conclusions coronary steal assessed by intracoronary doppler flow velocity measurements occurs in 10% of patients with a wide range of coronary collaterals to the vascular area from which blood flow is redistributed. there is a direct association between the presence of steal away from and the amount of collateral flow toward the region under investigation. collateral flow to the vascular region studied decreases during adenosine-induced hyperemia, which indicates a mechanism of steal via the extensive collaterals.
effect of vitamin c on prevention of complex regional pain syndrome type i in foot and ankle surgery. this is a multisite study examining the internal validity and comprehensiveness of the international association for the study of pain (iasp) diagnostic criteria for complex regional pain syndrome (crps). a standardized sign/symptom checklist was used in patient evaluations to obtain data on crps-related signs and symptoms in a series of 123 patients meeting iasp criteria for crps. principal components factor analysis (pca) was used to detect statistical groupings of signs/symptoms (factors). crps signs and symptoms grouped together statistically in a manner somewhat different than in current iasp/crps criteria. as in current criteria, a separate pain/sensation criterion was supported. however, unlike in current criteria, pca indicated that vasomotor symptoms form a factor distinct from a sudomotor/edema factor. changes in range of motion, motor dysfunction, and trophic changes, which are not included in the iasp criteria, formed a distinct fourth factor. scores on the pain/sensation factor correlated positively with pain duration (p , 0:001), but there was a negative correlation between the sudomotor/edema factor scores and pain duration (p , 0:05). the motor/trophic factor predicted positive responses to sympathetic block (p , 0:05). these results suggest that the internal validity of the iasp/crps criteria could be improved by separating vasomotor signs/symptoms (e.g. temperature and skin color asymmetry) from those re ̄ecting sudomotor dysfunction (e.g. sweating changes) and edema. results also indicate motor and trophic changes may be an important and distinct component of crps which is not currently incorporated in the iasp criteria. an experimental revision of crps diagnostic criteria for research purposes is proposed. implications for diagnostic sensitivity and speci®city are discussed. q 1999 international association for the study of pain. published by elsevier science b.v.
genomic modifiers of natural killer cells, immune responsiveness and lymphoid tissue remodeling together increase host resistance to viral infection the goal of most vaccines is the induction of long-lived memory t and b cells capable of protecting the host from infection by cytotoxic mechanisms, cytokines and high-affinity antibodies. however, efforts to develop vaccines against major human pathogens like hiv and hcv have not been successful, thereby highlighting the need for novel approaches to circumvent immunoregulatory mechanisms that limit induction of protective immunity. here we show that mouse natural killer (nk) cells inhibit generation of long-lived virus-specific memory t- and b-cells as well as virus-specific antibody production after acute infection. mechanistically, nk cells suppressed cd4 t cells and follicular helper t cells (tfh) in a perforin-dependent manner during the first few days of infection, resulting in a weaker germinal center (gc) response and diminished immune memory. we anticipate that innovative strategies to relieve nk cell-mediated suppression of immunity should facilitate development of efficacious new vaccines targeting difficult-to-prevent infections.
extensive calc i f icat ions objective the aim of this study was to report the clinicopathologic and radiologic features of 143 benign fibro-osseous lesions (bfols).   study design clinical and radiologic information were retrieved from the patients files, and histologic features were reviewed from hematoxylin and eosin-stained histologic slides.   results there were 22 ossifying fibromas (ofs), 21 fibrous dysplasias (fds) and 100 osseous dysplasias (ods; 65 florid, 18 focal, and 17 periapical). the mean age of the fd/of patients was a decade lower than those with od. the mandible was more affected than the maxilla, except in fds. all fds and ofs presented local swelling, whereas this was observed in <40% of the ods. radiologic images of the florid/periapical ods and ofs were predominantly mixed, whereas fds and focal ods were predominantly radiopaque.   conclusions florid od, of, and fd were the most common diagnoses, and the clinicopathologic and radiologic features were somewhat distinct from the characteristics of other populations.
mainly adrenal gland involving nk/t-cell nasal type lymphoma diagnosed with delay due to mimicking adrenal hemorrhage primary adrenal lymphoma (pal) is an extremely rare entity and adrenal insufficiency is a common complication. bilateral enlargement of adrenal glands should raise the suspicion of lymphoma, especially in patients with clinical or laboratory features of adrenal insufficiency. most of these cases are highly aggressive tumors and should be treated with multiagent chemotherapy. the role of bilateral adrenalectomy and/or radiotherapy cannot be estimated. our patient with pal was an 80-year-old man who presented with clinical and laboratory features of adrenal insufficiency. combination chemotherapy plus rituximab was unsuccessful and our patient died from progressive disease.
study of trace elements in wet atmospheric precipitation in tehran, iran the horizontal distribution and levels of heavy metals in the biggest snowstorm in shenyang since 1904 were investigated by analyzing 4 metals (as, cd, pb, and cu) in a series of ultraclean samples collected from 17 sites distributed in different regions of the shenyang area, china. the results showed that the concentrations of all the 4 heavy metals in snow from the industrial regions were high, up to 7.3 (as), 2.2 (cd), 850.0 (pb), and 0.197-20.2 (cu) microg/kg, respectively. in the suburb, in contrast, their concentrations were not detected, except for as. because of the long-term application of arsenical pesticides and herbicides, as was detected in the snow samples which collected on the farm. as, cd, and pb were also detected in the snow samples collected from the parks, the residential areas, and the commercial districts mainly by reason of human activities. in a sense, long-term industrial activities, traffic activities, coal combustion, and agricultural activities affected the horizontal distribution and levels of these heavy metals in snow differently. the data relating to the horizontal distribution and concentrations of heavy metals in the snow under extreme climatic conditions can provide with a unique snapshot of environmental pollution situation and behaviors in urban areas.
association of response to hepatitis b vaccination and survival in dialysis patients cytokines affect nearly every biological process; these include embryonic development, disease pathogenesis, non‐specific response to infection, specific response to antigen, changes in cognitive functions and progression of the degenerative processes of aging. in addition, cytokines are part of stem cell differentiation, vaccine efficacy and allograft rejection. this short insight focuses on the milestones in cytokine biology and how the various and often contradictory activities of these small, non‐structural proteins affected the fields of inflammation and immunology. multiple biological properties or pleiotropism is the hallmark of a cytokine. today, the term “cytokine” encompasses interferons, the interleukins, the chemokine family, mesenchymal growth factors, the tumor necrosis factor family and adipokines. as of this writing, 33 cytokines are called interleukins, but many are part of families of related but distinct gene products. there are certainly over 100 separate genes coding for cytokine‐like activities, many with overlapping functions and many still unexplored. also discussed in this overview are the failures and successes of cytokines as therapeutic targets. a recent advance in the field has been that of differential cytokine production, which can be used to classify human disease as being “autoimmune” or “autoinflammatory” thus impacting on therapeutic interventions.
inhibition of mtor sensitizes breast cancer stem cells to radiation-induced repression of self-renewal through the regulation of mnsod and akt ionizing radiation triggers diverse responses in human cells encompassing apoptosis, necrosis, stress-induced premature senescence (sips), autophagy, and endopolyploidy (e.g., multinucleation). most of these responses result in loss of colony-forming ability in the clonogenic survival assay. however, not all modes of so-called clonogenic cell “death” are necessarily advantageous for therapeutic outcome in cancer radiotherapy. for example, the crosstalk between sips and autophagy is considered to influence the capacity of the tumor cells to maintain a prolonged state of growth inhibition that unfortunately can be succeeded by tumor regrowth and disease recurrence. likewise, endopolyploid giant cells are able to segregate into near diploid descendants that continue mitotic activities. herein we review the current knowledge on the roles that the p53 and p21waf1 tumor suppressors play in determining the fate of human fibroblasts (normal and li-fraumeni syndrome) and solid tumor-derived cells after exposure to ionizing radiation. in addition, we discuss the important role of wip1, a p53-regulated oncogene, in the temporal regulation of the dna damage response and its contribution to p53 dynamics post-irradiation. this article highlights the complexity of the dna damage response and provides an impetus for rethinking the nature of cancer cell resistance to therapeutic agents.
3d visualisation and quantification by microcomputed tomography of late gestational changes in the arterial and venous feto-placental vasculature of the mouse. the current understanding of the placental vascular tree largely derives from time-consuming morphometric analyses performed by conventional histology, electron microscopy of corrosion casts and three-dimensional reconstructions based on physical tissue sections. in the present study, we demonstrate for the first time that micro-computed tomography (micro-ct) emerges as a new, non-destructive and fast tool for imaging and quantifying fetoplacental vasculature. term placentae (n=5) were perfused with contrast agent consisting of barium-sulfate, gelatine and thymol shortly after caesarean-section-delivery. samples (1 cm(3)) from eight different regions of the placenta were subsequently scanned in a micro-ct. using tomographic reconstruction algorithms, three dimensional images were obtained by micro-ct allowing total stereoscopic visualization and continuous quantitative analysis of the vascular structure of the investigated samples. these samples were compared regarding vascular surface (vs) and vascular density (vascular volume fraction, tcvf). quantitative assessment showed an average vascular density of 16 per cent (sd+/-0.4) and a vascular surface of 475 mm(2)(sd+/-8) per total tissue volume (including intervillous space) of 125 mm(3). micro-ct image-analysis showed no significant differences in the fetal vascularization among term placentae. micro-ct imaging is feasible for imaging and analysis of the villous vascular tree, allows further morphologic studies and immunohistochemistry of the placental specimens and may emerge as an additional tool in the investigation of the physiology and pathophysiology of the placental vasculature.
nanog-induced dedifferentiation of p53-deficient mouse astrocytes into brain cancer stem-like cells. somatic cell nuclear transfer allows trans-acting factors present in the mammalian oocyte to reprogram somatic cell nuclei to an undifferentiated state. we show that four factors (oct4, sox2, nanog, and lin28) are sufficient to reprogram human somatic cells to pluripotent stem cells that exhibit the essential characteristics of embryonic stem (es) cells. these induced pluripotent human stem cells have normal karyotypes, express telomerase activity, express cell surface markers and genes that characterize human es cells, and maintain the developmental potential to differentiate into advanced derivatives of all three primary germ layers. such induced pluripotent human cell lines should be useful in the production of new disease models and in drug development, as well as for applications in transplantation medicine, once technical limitations (for example, mutation through viral integration) are eliminated.
expression of lactate dehydrogenase-a and -b messenger ribonucleic acids in chick glycogen body. representatives of 30 species of fish were examined for their content of ldh isozymes. one major isozyme system was found in all fish. in addition, two minor systems restricted to eyes and to gonads were found in many fish. fish may be classified into four groups on the basis of their possession of one, two, three, or five major isozymes of ldh. the major isozyme patterns can be attributed to the polymers of two protein subunits under the control of two genes, as in mammals and birds, but the variety of heteropolymers produced varies in different species. the fluke and other flatfish are exceptional in that they synthesize only one kind of subunit which polymerizes to form a single variety of ldh. all other fish produced at least two major isozymes presumably the homopolymers of a and b subunits. the three-isozyme fish produce, in addition, a single heteropolymer. a few fish produce three heteropolymers and two homopolymers to produce the characteristic pattern of five isozymes seen in mammals.    in populations of the whiting, which has five major isozymes, two mutant alleles at the b locus were discovered. each of these alleles produced polypeptides with characteristic electrophoretic mobilities. consequently, heterozygous individuals contained more than 15 isozymes.    a variety of minor isozymes that appear on zymograms may represent modifications of the major isozymes. however, the minor isozyme systems of the gonad and the eye seem to be genetically distinct molecular systems, separate from and in addition to the major isozyme system.
knowledge, practices, and perceived barriers regarding cancer pain management among physicians and nurses in korea: a nationwide multicenter survey traditional education methods for physicians have failed to impact positively upon cancer pain clinical practice. this article presents a new paradigm for physician cancer pain education based on principles of adult learning and physician behavior theory. three key issues that weave together education and institutionalization issues are reviewed: (a) how to make physicians aware that their current practice behavior is less than optimal; (b) how to match education objectives with appropriate education formats; and (c) how to change pain management practices without imposing new burdens on physician practice.

whole blood transcriptional profiling reveals deregulation of oxidative and antioxidative defence genes in myelofibrosis and related neoplasms. potential implications of downregulation of nrf2 for genomic instability and disease progression it is widely accepted that the p53 tumor suppressor restricts abnormal cells by induction of growth arrest or by triggering apoptosis. here we show that, in addition, p53 protects the genome from oxidation by reactive oxygen species (ros), a major cause of dna damage and genetic instability. in the absence of severe stresses, relatively low levels of p53 are sufficient for upregulation of several genes with antioxidant products, which is associated with a decrease in intracellular ros. downregulation of p53 results in excessive oxidation of dna, increased mutation rate and karyotype instability, which are prevented by incubation with the antioxidant n-acetylcysteine (nac). dietary supplementation with nac prevented frequent lymphomas characteristic of trp53-knockout mice, and slowed the growth of lung cancer xenografts deficient in p53. our results provide a new paradigm for a nonrestrictive tumor suppressor function of p53 and highlight the potential importance of antioxidants in the prophylaxis and treatment of cancer.
does tsh trigger the anti-thyroid autoimmune processes? observation on a large cohort of naive patients with thyroid hemiagenesis fewer than 10 families have been reported with dilated cardiomyopathy and hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism (dcm-hh), which has been described as the ‘‘congestive cardiomyopathy-hypertrophic hypogonadism syndrome,’’ and may include mental retardation, broad nasal base, collagenoma, blepharoptosis, arachnodactyly, kyphoscoliosis,deafness, blindness, and minor bone abnormalities [najjar et al., 1973, 1984; sacks et al., 1980; malouf et al., 1985; warren et al., 1987; narahara et al., 1992]. because the phenotype is variable, genetic heterogeneity is likely. we report a new family with three siblings, in whom the proband also had thyroid hemiagenesis. the propositus is a 19-year-old male of turkish ancestry with dcm-hh born to unrelated parents. two older sisters had dcm confirmed by echocardiography, one of whom died as a result of dcm at 13 years of age. an autopsy was not permitted by family. an affected living sister is currently under consideration for cardiac transplantation. she also has hypertrophic hypogonadism with a normal thyroid by ultrasonography and no additional features of dcm-hh. the patient’s parents and youngest (third) sister were clinically and echocardiographically normal. at age 14 years, the propositus had been admitted to hospital for evaluation of heart failure due to dcm diagnosed in early childhood, complicated by ventricular tachycardia and recurrent cardiac decompensation. orthotopic heart transplantation was performed 12 months after initial admission, and he did well after the operation. at age 18 years, he had an endocrine consultation to evaluate delayed secondary sexual characteristics which included a eunuchoid appearance, absent facial hair and scant axillary and pubic hair, microphallus (stretched penile length 4 cm), and prepubertal testicular size (1 ml using prader orchidometer). there were no palpable masses in either testicle. the right lobe of the thyroid gland was easily palpable, but the left lobe was nonpalpable. hormonal assessment supported the diagnosis of hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism with serum total testosterone 220 ng/dl (normal range, 280– 880 ng/dl), serum-free testosterone 7.35 ng/ml (normal range, 10–42 ng/ml), luteinizing hormone 22.8 miu/ml (normal range, 1.7–8.6 miu/ml), and follicle-stimulating hormone 49.7 miu/ml (normal range, 0.7–11.4 miu/ml). he was treated with intramuscular testosterone at a dose of 250 mg every 3 weeks. after 3 months, the serum level of folliclestimulating hormone normalized (7.6 miu/ml) and the serum-free testosterone level was 22.6 ng/ml. in the following months, the patient showed progressive muscular development, voice deepening, facial and body hair, penis growth to 8 cm, and increased testicular volume. thyroid function tests at initial endocrine consultation were consistent with subclinical hypothyroidism. thyroid ultrasonography and scintigraphy (sodium 99m tc pertechnetate) showed absence of the left lobe of the thyroid gland and isthmus. twenty-five to thirty percent of the cases of dcm are familial which can be transmitted as autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, x-linked, or as a matrilineal (mitochondrial) trait [seidman and seidman, 2001]. table i summarizes the clinical data on the ‘‘syndrome’’ of dcm combined with hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism (dcm-hh) and other
abstract stimulus-specific adaptation models neurons in the primary auditory cortex respond less strongly to a commonly occurring “standard” tone than to the same tone when it is rare or “deviant.” this phenomenon, called “stimulus-specific adaptation” (ssa), has been proposed as a possible single-neuron correlate of the mismatch negativity, a cortical evoked potential associated with stimulus novelty. previous studies in cat did not observe ssa in single neurons in the auditory thalamus. however, these reports did not differentiate between the auditory thalamic subdivisions and did not examine the effects of changing the stimulus presentation rate. to explore the possibility of thalamic ssa more completely, we recorded extracellularly from 30 single units and 22 multiunit clusters in the ventral, medial, and dorsal subdivisions of the mouse medial geniculate body (mgb), while presenting the anesthetized animals with sequences of standard and deviant tones at interstimulus intervals of 400, 500 and 800 ms. we found ssa in the auditory thalamus at all three stimulus presentation rates, primarily in the medial subdivision but to a lesser degree also in the ventral mgb. thalamic ssa was evident from the earliest onset of tone-evoked activity, although the latencies of responses to standard and deviant tones were not significantly different. together with related findings of ssa in neurons of the “belt” regions of the inferior colliculus, these results demonstrate that ssa is present at subcortical levels, primarily in but not restricted to the nonlemniscal auditory pathway.
structural insights into adeno-associated virus serotype 5 abstract adeno-associated viruses (aavs) are being developed as gene therapy vectors, and their efficacy could be improved by a detailed understanding of their viral capsid structures. aav serotype 8 (aav8) shows a significantly greater liver transduction efficiency than those of other serotypes, which has resulted in efforts to develop this virus as a gene therapy vector for hemophilia a and familial hypercholesterolemia. pseudotyping studies show that the differential tissue tropism and transduction efficiencies exhibited by the aavs result from differences in their capsid viral protein (vp) amino acids. towards identifying the structural features underpinning these disparities, we report the crystal structure of the aav8 viral capsid determined to 2.6-å resolution. the overall topology of its common overlapping vp is similar to that previously reported for the crystal structures of aav2 and aav4, with an eight-stranded β-barrel and long loops between the β-strands. the most significant structural differences between aav8 and aav2 (the best-characterized serotype) are located on the capsid surface at protrusions surrounding the two-, three-, and fivefold axes at residues reported to control transduction efficiency and antibody recognition for aav2. in addition, a comparison of the aav8 and aav2 capsid surface amino acids showed a reduced distribution of basic charge for aav8 at the mapped aav2 heparin sulfate receptor binding region, consistent with an observed non-heparin-binding phenotype for aav8. thus, this aav8 structure provides an additional platform for mutagenesis efforts to characterize aav capsid regions responsible for differential cellular tropism, transduction, and antigenicity for these promising gene therapy vectors.

alzheimer's phenotypes induced by overexpression of human presenilin 2 mutant proteins stimulate significant changes in key factors of glucose metabolism. cerebellar granule cells grown in the presence of a serum complex differentiate but are resistant to the lethal action of excitatory amino acids. when these cells are grown also in the presence of insulin-like growth factor i (igf-i) they become fully susceptible to the toxic, lethal action of glutamate. the glutamate-sensitizing action of igf-i is dependent on concentration (half-maximal effect at 2-4 ng/ml) and time (half-maximal effect at 2-4 days in vitro) and is paralleled by the appearance of functionally active, glutamate-activated, ca2+ channels and of voltage-gated na+ and late k+ channels. igf-i-induced glutamate sensitivity is rapidly reversible (t1/2 = 30-60 min) after removal of this somatomedin. the action of igf-i is not mimicked by igf-ii, nerve growth factor, basic or acidic fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, or tumor necrosis factor alpha. we postulate that the constitutive phenotype of cerebellar granule cells is glutamate-resistant and becomes responsive to excitatory amino acids under the action of epigenetic cues among which igf-i may be one of those operative in vivo.
serum uric acid predicts vascular complications in adults with type 1 diabetes: the coronary artery calcification in type 1 diabetes study background immunoglobulin-a nephropathy (igan) is the most common chronic glomerulonephritis worldwide. many clinical and histopathological risk factors for progression have been found previously. recently, metabolic risk factors, such as hyperuricaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia, also have been associated with the progression of igan.   methods in the present study we correlated clinical and metabolic risk factors with histopathological parameters in 202 patients with igan. morphological changes in glomerular, tubulointerstitial and vascular tissue were semiquantitatively graded into three classes. mesangial proliferation activity and the amount of inflammatory cells were also evaluated by immunohistochemical staining of ki-67 (mib-1), cd45 (lca) and cd68 stainings. serum uric acid, triglycerides and cholesterol, urine protein excretion (upe), blood pressure and body mass index (bmi) were measured. smoking habits and occurrence of diabetes mellitus also were evaluated. the independent role of serum uric acid in the development of renal morphological changes was evaluated in multivariate analysis.   results serum uric acid and upe level correlated with several histological parameters. uric acid level showed the strongest correlation with tubulointerstitial changes and upe with glomerulosclerosis. the level of serum triglycerides correlated with interstitial fibrosis and hyaline arteriolosclerosis. blood pressure correlated with hyaline arteriolosclerosis, glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial changes. bmi and diabetes mellitus correlated with both tubulointerstitial and vascular changes. we found no significant correlations between histopathological parameters and smoking habits or serum cholesterol level. serum uric acid had independent associations with the presence of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis and inflammation.   conclusions we conclude that many metabolic factors are univariately associated with renal morphological findings in igan. these same factors are central in the metabolic or insulin resistance syndrome and may have a pathogenetic role in the progression of igan. serum uric acid may have an independent role in development of tubulointerstitial lesions as well as being associated with inflammation in renal tissue of patients with igan.

genetic and environmental correlations between body mass index and waist circumference in china: the qingdao adolescent twin study with the changing patterns of morbidity and mortality in china, noncommunicable chronic diseases have become the major threats to the health of the chinese population. the causes of chronic diseases include genetic factors and behavioral risk factors such as the use of tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs, unhealthy dietary behaviors, and lack of physical activity. twin studies offer a unique opportunity to disentangle the genetic and environmental risk and protective factors for chronic disease. the qingdao twin registry (qtr) was initiated in 1998 as part of the national chinese twin registry. over 11,000 pairs of twins and multiples of all ages have been recruited into the registry. several studies of physical and mental health are underway. many of the adult twins have completed health and behavioral risk factor surveys, and the adolescent twins are participating in a study of gene-environment interactions in tobacco and alcohol use. studies of the heritability of personality factors have been conducted. in 2002, qingdao established the qingdao twin health promotion association, a nonprofit organization that supports health services for twins and their parents, organizes special events and health-related activities for twins, and raises funds to conduct twin health examinations. the qtr will be a useful resource for future studies of population genetics in human health and disease.
the fam deubiquitylating enzyme localizes to multiple points of protein trafficking in epithelia, where it associates with e-cadherin and beta-catenin. the golgi apparatus is a dynamic organelle through which nascent secretory and transmembrane proteins are transported, post-translationally modified and finally packaged into carrier vesicles for transport along the cytoskeleton to a variety of destinations. in the past decade, studies have shown that a number of 'molecular motors' are involved in maintaining the proper structure and function of the golgi apparatus. here, we review just some of the many functions performed by these mechanochemical enzymes — dyneins, kinesins, myosins and dynamin — in relation to the golgi apparatus.
real-time estimates of hepatic gluconeogenesis 1 real-time detection of hepatic gluconeogenic and glycogenolytic states using hyperpolarized [ 2-13 c ] dihydroxyacetone * a method is introduced for estimating the contribution of gluconeogenesis to glucose production. 2h2o is administered orally to achieve 0.5% deuterium enrichment in body water. enrichments are determined in the hydrogens bound to carbons 2 and 6 of blood glucose and in urinary water. enrichment at carbon 6 of glucose is assayed in hexamethylenetetramine, formed from formaldehyde produced by periodate oxidation of the glucose. enrichment at carbon 2 is assayed in lactate formed by enzymatic transfer of the hydrogen from glucose via sorbitol to pyruvate. the fraction gluconeogenesis contributes to glucose production equals the ratio of the enrichment at carbon 6 to that at carbon 2 or in urinary water. applying the method, the contribution of gluconeogenesis in healthy subjects was 23-42% after fasting 14 h, increasing to 59-84% after fasting 42 h. enrichment at carbon 2 to that in urinary water was 1.12 +/- 0.13. therefore, the assumption that hydrogen equilibrated during hexose-6-p isomerization was fulfilled. the 3h/14c ratio in glucose formed from [3-3h,3-14c]lactate given to healthy subjects was 0.1 to 0.2 of that in the lactate. therefore equilibration during gluconeogenesis of the hydrogen bound to carbon 6 with that in body water was 80-90% complete, so that gluconeogenesis is underestimated by 10-20%. glycerol's contribution to gluconeogenesis is not included in these estimates. the method is applicable to studies in humans of gluconeogenesis at safe doses of 2h2o.
prefrontal cortex lesions augment the location-related firing properties of area te/perirhinal cortex neurons in a working memory task. 1. the dopaminergic mesencephalic neurons projecting to the hippocampal formation are distributed in three cell groups: a8 region in the retrorubral field, a9 region in the substantia nigra and a10 region in the ventral tegmental area. 2. anterograde and retrograde tract-tracing techniques combined with immunohistochemical procedures indicate a topographical organization of mesencephalic dopaminergic projections towards the hippocampal formation. 3. electrophysiological evidence suggest that dopaminergic mesencephalic neurons could have a regulatory role in suppressing hippocampal excitability. 4. the functional significance of the mesohippocampal dopaminergic system is largely unknown, although it was suggested that this projection could have a role in methamphetamine-produced hypermotility and in modulation of memory processes.
relationship of the changes of cervical mri, tcd and baep in patients with "isolated" vertigo. abstract objectives: vertigo can be a manifestation of underlying vertebrobasilar stroke in older adults. the study objectives were to investigate the correlation, sensitivity, and specificity of the auditory brainstem response (abr), electronystagmorgraphy (eng), and transcranial doppler (tcd) collectively to distinguish between vertigo due to vertebrobasilar insufficiency (vbi) and vertigo due to non-vbi. design: prospective experimental study comparing eng, abr, and tcd battery findings between two groups of patients with vertigo and a control group. study sample: participants included 14 patients with vertigo of vbi origin, 14 patients with vertigo of non-vbi, and 11 matched controls. results: participants with vbi had more abnormal findings in the eng (86%), tcd (72%), and abr (64%) compared to the non-vbi group (64%, 21%, and 7%, respectively) and the control group. the combined battery revealed positive correlations, 64% sensitivity, and 84% positive predictive value (ppv) in the vbi group, and 100% specificity with lack of correlations in the non-vbi group. conclusions: the modest sensitivity and ppv helps with early detection of vbi, thus preventing risk of vertebrobasilar stroke in 84% to 64% of patients. the 100% specificity in the non-vbi group rules out vbi, thus reducing the referral rate for unnecessary, diagnostic evaluations and ineffective treatment.
computational methodology for chip-seq analysis recent progress in massively parallel sequencing platforms has enabled genome-wide characterization of dna-associated proteins using the combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (chip-seq). although a variety of methods exist for analysis of the established alternative chip microarray (chip-chip), few approaches have been described for processing chip-seq data. to fill this gap, we propose an analysis pipeline specifically designed to detect protein-binding positions with high accuracy. using previously reported data sets for three transcription factors, we illustrate methods for improving tag alignment and correcting for background signals. we compare the sensitivity and spatial precision of three peak detection algorithms with published methods, demonstrating gains in spatial precision when an asymmetric distribution of tags on positive and negative strands is considered. we also analyze the relationship between the depth of sequencing and characteristics of the detected binding positions, and provide a method for estimating the sequencing depth necessary for a desired coverage of protein binding sites.
apelin treatment increases complete fatty acid oxidation, mitochondrial oxidative capacity, and biogenesis in muscle of insulin-resistant mice adipose tissue (at) secretes several adipokines that influence insulin sensitivity and potentially link obesity to insulin resistance. apelin, a peptide present in different tissues, is also secreted by adipocytes. apelin is upregulated in obese and hyperinsulinemic humans and mice. although a tight relation exists between the regulation of apelin and insulin, it remains largely unknown whether apelin affects whole-body glucose utilization. herein, we show that in chow-fed mice, acute intravenous injection of apelin has a powerful glucose-lowering effect associated with enhanced glucose utilization in skeletal muscle and at. through in vivo and in vitro pharmacological and genetic approaches, we demonstrate the involvement of endothelial no synthase, amp-activated protein kinase, and akt in apelin-stimulated glucose uptake in soleus muscle. remarkably, in obese and insulin-resistant mice, apelin restored glucose tolerance and increased glucose utilization. apelin could thus represent a promising target in the management of insulin resistance.
population encoding by circadian clock neurons organizes circadian behavior the mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus (scn) is a master circadian pacemaker. it is not known which scn neurons are autonomous pacemakers or how they synchronize their daily firing rhythms to coordinate circadian behavior. vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (vip) and the vip receptor vpac2 (encoded by the gene vipr2) may mediate rhythms in individual scn neurons, synchrony between neurons, or both. we found that vip−/− and vipr2−/− mice showed two daily bouts of activity in a skeleton photoperiod and multiple circadian periods in constant darkness. loss of vip or vpac2 also abolished circadian firing rhythms in approximately half of all scn neurons and disrupted synchrony between rhythmic neurons. critically, daily application of a vpac2 agonist restored rhythmicity and synchrony to vip−/− scn neurons, but not to vipr2−/− neurons. we conclude that vip coordinates daily rhythms in the scn and behavior by synchronizing a small population of pacemaking neurons and maintaining rhythmicity in a larger subset of neurons.
antiperoxidative and anti-apoptotic effects of lycopene and ellagic acid on cyclophosphamide-induced testicular lipid peroxidation and apoptosis. the present study was undertaken to find out the adverse effects of cyclophosphamide on testicular activities along with testicular oxidative stress at its therapeutic dose and the protective effects of f -tocopherol succinate on testicular dysfunctions induced by cyclophosphamide in mature albino rats. a significant diminution in the activities of testicular j 5 , 3 g -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (hsd) and 17 g -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (hsd) along with significant reduction in the plasma level of testosterone and number of spermatogonia-a (asg), preleptotene spermatocytes (plsc), midpachytene spermatocytes (mpsc) and step 7 spermatids (7sd) at stage vii of spermatogenic cycle were observed following cyclophosphamide treatment. oxidative stress was also noted in testis, which was enlightened by significant elevation in the level of malondialdehyde (mda) and conjugated dienes along with significant reduction in the activities of testicular peroxidase and catalase. co-administration of f -tocopherol succinate in cyclophosphamide-treated rats resulted a significant restoration of all the above-mentioned parameters to the control level. the results of our experiment suggest that cyclophosphamide treatment at its clinical dose is associated with antigonadal activities as well as induction of oxidative stress in gonad that can be ameliorated significantly by f -tocopherol succinate co-administration. so, our data have some potential clinical implications.
novel mt1-mmp small-molecule inhibitors based on insights into hemopexin domain function in tumor growth. invasive cell migration through tissue barriers requires pericellular remodelling of extracellular matrix (ecm) executed by cell-surface proteases, particularly membrane-type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (mt1-mmp/mmp-14). using time-resolved multimodal microscopy, we show how invasive ht-1080 fibrosarcoma and mda-mb-231 breast cancer cells coordinate mechanotransduction and fibrillar collagen remodelling by segregating the anterior force-generating leading edge containing β1 integrin, mt1-mmp and f-actin from a posterior proteolytic zone executing fibre breakdown. during forward movement, sterically impeding fibres are selectively realigned into microtracks of single-cell calibre. microtracks become expanded by multiple following cells by means of the large-scale degradation of lateral ecm interfaces, ultimately prompting transition towards collective invasion similar to that in vivo. both ecm track widening and transition to multicellular invasion are dependent on mt1-mmp-mediated collagenolysis, shown by broad-spectrum protease inhibition and rna interference. thus, invasive migration and proteolytic ecm remodelling are interdependent processes that control tissue micropatterning and macropatterning and, consequently, individual and collective cell migration.
cerebral erdheim-chester disease: case report and review of the literature two patients with erdheim-chester disease with progressive cerebellar dysfunction and pyramidal signs are reported on. cerebral mri showed bilateral increased signal intensity in peridentatal regions on t2 weighted sequences. both patients had kidney and bone involvement, established on bone biopsy for one. one patient improved with steroid therapy. this contrasts with previous reports, which describe rare neurological manifestations and the failure of different therapeutic approaches.
n-acetyl cysteine plus clomiphene citrate versus metformin and clomiphene citrate in treatment of clomiphene-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome: a randomized controlled trial. aim. to elucidate the dynamics of fsh, lh, prolactin (prl), tsh and insulin secretion in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (pcos) treated with metformin (met). patients and methods. in a prospective, controlled and randomised trial, 32 women with pcos and 32 with normal cycle were recruited to receive met (850 mg b.i.d.) or placebo (n: 16 for each subgroup) for an average of 40 days. pituitary function and insulin secretion were assessed before and after intervention by gnrh-trh tests and oral glucose tolerance test induced insulin response. results. basal and area under the response curve (aurc) lh values were higher in pcos than in normal controls before met and declined following treatment in the former group (p < 0.05). ovulatory pcos responders had lower basal lh, aurclh and aurcprl values during met than anovulatory cases (p < 0.05 for all) and aurcins was lower in ovulatory than anovulatory pcos before and on met (p < 0.02–p < 0.05), with a rise of quicky index in the former group during met treatment (p < 0.05). fsh and tsh were similar. conclusions. met administration lowered lh activity in all pcos women and in ovulatory responders and also compromised prl stimulated secretion in the latter cases. these findings were indicative of an effect of met on pituitary activity.
comparison of gene expression profile between tumor tissue and adjacent non-tumor tissue in patients with gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumor (gist) background and aims resistance is a major challenge in the treatment of patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (gists). we investigated the mechanisms of resistance in patients with progressive gists with primary kit mutations and the efficacy of the kinase inhibitor pkc412 for the inhibition of imatinib-resistant mutants.   methods we performed a cytogenetic analysis and screened for mutations of the kit and pdgfra kinase domains in 26 resistant gists. kit autophosphorylation status was assessed by western immunoblotting. imatinib-resistant gist cells and ba/f3 cells expressing these mutant proteins were tested for sensitivity to imatinib and pkc412.   results six distinct secondary mutations in kit were detected in 12 progressive tumors, with v654a and t670i found to be recurrent. one progressive tumor showed acquired pdgfra -d842v mutation. amplification of kit or kit / pdgfra was found in 2 patients. eight of 10 progressive tumors available for analysis showed phosphorylated kit. two remaining progressive tumors lost kit protein expression. gist cells carrying kit -del557-558/t670i or kit -insay502-503/v654a mutations were resistant to imatinib, while pkc412 significantly inhibited autophosporylation of these mutants. resistance to imatinib and sensitivity to pkc412 of kit -t670i and pdgfra -d842v mutants was confirmed using ba/f3 cells.   conclusions this study shows the high frequency of kit/pdgfra kinase domain mutations in patients with secondary resistance and defines genomic amplification of kit / pdgfra as an alternative cause of resistance to the drug. in a subset of patients, cancer cells lost their dependence on the targeted tyrosine kinase. our findings show the sensitivity of the imatinib-resistant kit -t670i and kit -v654a and of pdgfra -d842v mutants to pkc412.
the carma3-bcl10-malt1 signalosome drives nfκb activation and promotes aggressiveness in angiotensin ii receptor-positive breast cancer. the paracaspase malt1 has a central role in the activation of lymphocytes and other immune cells including myeloid cells, mast cells and nk cells. malt1 activity is required not only for the immune response, but also for the development of natural treg cells that keep the immune response in check. exaggerated malt1 activity has been associated with the development of lymphoid malignancies, and recently developed malt1 inhibitors show promising anti-tumor effects in xenograft models of diffuse large b cell lymphoma. in this review, we provide an overview of the present understanding of malt1’s function, and discuss possibilities for its therapeutic targeting based on recently developed inhibitors and animal models.
clinical, hematological and biochemical alterations in hamster (mesocricetus auratus) experimentally infected with leishmania infantum through different routes of inoculation to develop and test new therapeutics and immune prophylaxis strategies for visceral leishmaniasis (vl), understanding tissue parasitism evolution after experimental infection with leishmania infantum is important. experimental infection in a hamster model (mesocricetus auratus) reproduces several typical aspects of canine and human vl that are closely related to the inoculum’s route. we quantified the parasitism in the liver and spleen of hamsters experimentally infected by various routes (intradermal, intraperitoneal, and intracardiac [ic]) and different strains of l. infantum (mhom/br/74/pp75 and wild) and compared two different methodologies to evaluate tissue parasitism (leishman donovan units [ldu] and real-time qpcr). in addition, the quantification of specific total-igg in the serum of uninfected and infected hamsters was determined by elisa. the animals were followed for 1, 3, 6 and 9 months post-infection for survival analysis. we found that infection with the wild strain by the ic route resulted in higher mortality. positive antibody (igg) responses were detected with higher peaks at 6 and 9 months in the ic group inoculated with pp75 strain. however, in animals infected with the wild strain the igg levels were elevated in all infected groups during all the time evaluated. we also observed by ldu analysis that the ic route lead to higher parasitism in the liver and spleen with both strains. furthermore, qpcr showed higher sensitivity for identifying animals with low parasitic burden. in conclusion, qpcr can be useful for assessing parasitism in the spleen and liver of a hamster model infected with l. infantum independent of the route of infection, and this technique may become an essential tool for assessing parasite density in the hamster model after experimental treatment or immunization with potential vaccine candidates.
cyld inhibits tumorigenesis and metastasis by blocking jnk/ap1 signaling at multiple levels familial cylindromatosis is an autosomal dominant predisposition to tumours of skin appendages called cylindromas. familial cylindromatosis is caused by mutations in a gene encoding the cyld protein of previously unknown function. here we show that cyld is a deubiquitinating enzyme that negatively regulates activation of the transcription factor nf-κb by specific tumour-necrosis factor receptors (tnfrs). loss of the deubiquitinating activity of cyld correlates with tumorigenesis. cyld inhibits activation of nf-κb by the tnfr family members cd40, xedar and edar in a manner that depends on the deubiquitinating activity of cyld. downregulation of cyld by rna-mediated interference augments both basal and cd40-mediated activation of nf-κb. the inhibition of nf-κb activation by cyld is mediated, at least in part, by the deubiquitination and inactivation of tnfr-associated factor 2 (traf2) and, to a lesser extent, traf6. these results indicate that cyld is a negative regulator of the cytokine-mediated activation of nf-κb that is required for appropriate cellular homeostasis of skin appendages.
unusual complications of quinalphos poisoning pancreatitis secondary to organophosphate insecticide toxicity is rare and is believed to follow a subclinical and uneventful course. we report two cases of severe acute pancreatitis complicated by pancreatic necrosis and retroperitoneal sepsis in which the diagnosis was obscured by the systemic effects of organophosphate toxicity. awareness of this complication should prompt earlier investigation because early diagnosis coupled with timely therapeutic measures may improve patient prognosis.
dishevelled binds the discs large ‘hook’ domain to activate gukholder-dependent spindle positioning in drosophila the family of membrane-associated guanylate kinase (maguk) scaffold proteins comprises members that function at neuronal synapses, tight junctions, immunological synapses, and neutrophil membranes. through their multiple domains, maguks organize events of signal transduction, cell adhesion, and molecular trafficking. here, we use nuclear magnetic resonance, small-angle x-ray scattering, and rosetta modeling to reveal the structural preferences and interdomain dynamics of the maguk core (pdz3-sh3-guanylate kinase) from postsynaptic density-95 (psd-95), the best known maugk. psd-95 is highly abundant in the postsynaptic density of excitatory neurons and is responsible for coupling glutamate receptors with internal postsynaptic structures. these solution-based studies show that the maguk core pdz domain (pdz3) interacts directly with the sh3 domain via its canonical peptide binding groove, with the connecting linker serving as an adhesive. this weak interaction, however, is dynamic and weakened further by pdz3 ligands and linker phosphorylation, suggesting that domain dynamics may be central to maguk function.
evolution of the hypoxia-sensitive cells involved in amniote respiratory reflexes visualizing the beginnings of melanoma in cancer biology, a tumor begins from a single cell within a group of precancerous cells that share genetic mutations. kaufman et al. used a zebrafish melanoma model to visualize cancer initiation (see the perspective by boumahdi and blanpain). they used a fluorescent reporter that specifically lit up neural crest progenitors that are only present during embryogenesis or during adult melanoma tumor formation. the appearance of this tumor correlated with a set of gene regulatory elements, called super-enhancers, whose identification and manipulation may prove beneficial in detecting and preventing melanoma initiation. science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aad2197; see also p. 453 melanocytes with oncogenic or tumor suppressor mutations revert to expressing the crestin gene early in melanoma formation. [also see perspective by boumahdi and blanpain] introduction the “cancerized field” concept posits that cells in a given tissue sharing an oncogenic mutation are cancer-prone, yet only discreet clones within the field initiate tumors. studying the process of cancer initiation has remained challenging because of (i) the rarity of these events, (ii) the difficulty of visiualizing initiating clones in living organisms, and (iii) the transient nature of a newly transformed clone emerging before it expands to form an early tumor. a more complete understanding of the molecular processes that regulate cancer initiation could provide important prognostic information about which precancerous lesions are most prone to becoming cancer and also implicate druggable molecular pathways that, when inhibited, may prevent the cancer from ever starting. rationale the majority of benign nevi carry oncogenic brafv600e mutations and can be considered a cancerized field of melanocytes, but they only rarely convert to melanoma. in an effort to define events that initiate cancer, we used a melanoma model in the zebrafish in which the human brafv600e oncogene is driven by the melanocyte-specific mitfa promoter. when bred into a p53 mutant background, these fish develop melanoma tumors over the course of many months. the zebrafish crestin gene is expressed embryonically in neural crest progenitors (ncps) and is specifically reexpressed only in melanoma tumors, making it an ideal candidate for tracking melanoma from initiation onward. results we developed a crestin:egfp reporter that recapitulates the embryonic neural crest expression pattern of crestin and its expression in melanoma tumors. we show through live imaging of transgenic zebrafish crestin reporters that within a cancerized field (brafv600e-mutant; p53-deficient), a single melanocyte reactivates the ncp state, and this establishes that a fate change occurs at melanoma initiation in this model. early crestin+ patches of cells expand and are transplantable in a manner consistent with their possessing tumorigenic activity, and they exhibit a gene expression pattern consistent with the ncp identity readout by the crestin reporter. the crestin element is regulated by ncp transcription factors, including sox10. forced sox10 overexpression in melanocytes accelerated melanoma formation, whereas crispr/cas9 targeting of sox10 delayed melanoma onset. we show activation of super-enhancers at ncp genes in both zebrafish and human melanomas, identifying an epigenetic mechanism for control of this ncp signature leading to melanoma. conclusion this work using our zebrafish melanoma model and in vivo reporter of ncp identity allows us to see cancer from its birth as a single cell and shows the importance of ncp-state reemergence as a key event in melanoma initiation from a field of cancer-prone melanocytes. thus, in addition to the typical fixed genetic alterations in oncogenes and tumor supressors that are required for cancer development, the reemergence of progenitor identity may be an additional rate-limiting step in the formation of melanoma. preventing ncp reemergence in a field of cancer-prone melanocytes may thus prove therapeutically useful, and the association of ncp genes with super-enhancer regulatory elements implicates the associated druggable epigenetic machinery in this process. neural crest reporter expression in melanoma. the crestin:egfp transgene is specifically expressed in melanoma in brafv600e/p53 mutant melanoma-prone zebrafish. (top) a single cell expressing crestin:egfp expands into a small patch of cells over the course of 2 weeks, capturing the initiation of melanoma formation (bracket). (bottom) a fully formed melanoma specifically expresses crestin:egfp, whereas the rest of the fish remains egfp-negative. the “cancerized field” concept posits that cancer-prone cells in a given tissue share an oncogenic mutation, but only discreet clones within the field initiate tumors. most benign nevi carry oncogenic brafv600e mutations but rarely become melanoma. the zebrafish crestin gene is expressed embryonically in neural crest progenitors (ncps) and specifically reexpressed in melanoma. live imaging of transgenic zebrafish crestin reporters shows that within a cancerized field (brafv600e-mutant; p53-deficient), a single melanocyte reactivates the ncp state, revealing a fate change at melanoma initiation in this model. ncp transcription factors, including sox10, regulate crestin expression. forced sox10 overexpression in melanocytes accelerated melanoma formation, which is consistent with activation of ncp genes and super-enhancers leading to melanoma. our work highlights ncp state reemergence as a key event in melanoma initiation.
a fiber-based ratiometric optical cardiac mapping channel using a diffraction grating and split detector. transmembrane voltage-sensitive fluorescence measurements are limited by baseline drift that can obscure changes in resting membrane potential and by motion artifacts that can obscure repolarization. voltage-dependent shift of emission wavelengths may allow reduction of drift and motion artifacts by emission ratiometry. we have tested this for action potentials and potassium-induced changes in resting membrane potential in rabbit hearts stained with di-4-anepps [pyridinium, 4-(2-(6-(dibutylamino)-2-naphthalenyl) ethenyl)-1-(3-sulfopropyl)-, hydroxide, inner salt] using laser excitation (488 nm) and a two-photomultiplier tube system or spectrofluorometer (resolution of 500-1,000 hz and <1 mm). green and red emissions produced upright and inverted action potentials, respectively. ratios of green emission to red emission followed action potential contours and exhibited larger fractional changes than either emission alone (p < 0.001). the largest changes and signal-to-noise ratio (signal/noise) were obtained with numerator wavelengths of 525-550 nm and denominator wavelengths of 650-700 nm. ratiometry lessened drift 56-66% (p < 0.015) and indicated decreases in resting membrane potential. ratiometry lessened motion artifacts and increased magnitudes of deflections representing phase-zero depolarizations relative to total deflections by 123-188% in intact hearts (p < 0.02). durations of action potentials at different pacing rates, temperatures, and potassium concentrations were independent of whether they were measured ratiometrically or with microelectrodes (p > or = 0.65). the ratiometric calibration slope was 0.017/100 mv and decreased with time. thus emission ratiometry lessens the effects of motion and drift and indicates resting membrane potential changes and repolarization.
clinical outcomes after multiligament injured knees: medial versus lateral reconstructions medial-sided knee injuries can result in pain, instability, and loss of function. many clinical studies have been written on the treatment of medial-sided knee injuries; however, the vast majority are isolated case series of surgical or nonoperative treatment regimens, and only a few randomized prospective clinical trials can be found in the literature that compare different treatment modalities. comparison of these treatments is challenging due to the variety of medial-sided structures that can be involved, the multiple different approaches to treatment, and the variability of how objective and subjective clinical outcomes are reported. in this paper we report on the injuries by extent and type of anatomic structures damaged including partial medial-sided injuries, completed isolated medial-sided knee injuries, and combined injuries. in general, most authors concur that isolated partial or complete medial collateral ligament (mcl) injuries can be treated nonoperatively with a brace and early motion with good clinical outcomes. prospective, randomized trials support nonoperative treatment of the mcl in combined anterior cruciate ligament-mcl injuries. knee dislocations and posterior medial corner injuries appear to have better results with surgical management including reconstruction. multiple reconstructive techniques have been described for chronic injuries but it is difficult to compare their results.
fluoride retention in proximal plaque and saliva using two naf dentifrices containing 5,000 and 1,450 ppm f with and without water rinsing the aim of this paper was to describe what experts of today believe are the main reasons explaining the caries decline seen in many westernized countries over the past 3 decades. we have collected the views of a number of international experts, trying to answer the specific question "what are the main reasons why 20-25-year-old persons have less caries nowadays, compared to 30 years ago?". a questionnaire was mailed to 55 experts with a number of thinkable explanations to be scored according to a predetermined scale. the 25 items were divided into main groups under the heading of diet, fluorides, plaque, saliva, dentist/dental materials and other factors. the experts were asked to think of a specific country or area, and also to specify whether the chosen area had water fluoridation or not. the main finding of our study, based on a 95% response rate, was that there is a very large variation in how the experts graded the impact of various possible factors. for the use of fluoride toothpaste, there was a clear agreement of a definite positive effect.
previous institutionalization is followed by broader amygdala–hippocampal–pfc network connectivity during aversive learning in human development development of anxiety disorders is associated with neurobiological changes in areas that are a critical part of the fear neurocircuitry. fear conditioning paradigms can offer insight into the mechanisms underlying the neurobiological ontogeny of anxiety. a small number of studies have focused on the effects of age and anxiety separately in school age children. the present study aimed to investigate these effects in 8-13 year old children with higher and lower trait anxiety. we examined differential fear conditioning and extinction using skin conductance responses and fear-potentiated startle in 60 children recruited from a low-income urban population. the results indicated that children under 10 years of age show poor discrimination of conditioned stimuli, and that anxiety increases fear responses during fear acquisition. after controlling for age and trauma exposure, fear-potentiated startle to the safety cue predicted child anxiety levels suggesting that impaired safety signal learning may be a risk factor for anxiety disorders in adulthood. identifying risk phenotypes in children may provide opportunities for early intervention and prevention of illness.
lectin-reactive α-fetoprotein (afp-l3%) curability and prediction of clinical course after treatment of non-seminomatous germ cell tumors we report false elevations of serum human chorionic gonadotropin levels in 4 patients with testicular germ cell tumors. elevated circulating luteinizing hormone levels that resulted from unilateral orchiectomy were responsible for the falsely positive human chorionic gonadotropin activity measured in commercial radioimmunoassays. in 3 patients tested aliquots of serum evaluated in reliable human chorionic gonadotropin assay systems revealed no elevation. we administered testosterone to 3 patients who had elevations of luteinizing hormone and human chorionic gonadotropin levels. luteinizing hormone was suppress-d to normal levels 1 week later in 2 patients and in 1 it was diminished but still slightly elevated. in all 3 cases the falsely positive human chorionic gonadotropin results converted to negative. recognition of falsely positive elevations of human chorionic gonadotropin can spare patients unnecessary operations and/or chemotherapy.
comparison between k3edta and lithium heparin as anticoagulant to isolate bovine granulocytes from blood neutrophils play a key role in initiating an innate immune response, being the first type of immune cell arriving at the site of injury or infection. these cells are able to mount a direct anti-bactericidal response by the production of reactive oxygen or reactive nitrogen species (ros/rns). an important component of the host innate immune response is recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (pamps) by pattern recognition receptors (prrs). toll-like receptors (tlrs) are an important family of prrs and, are a key component in activation of innate immune mechanisms. in the present study we described the presence of mrna transcripts for tlr1, tlr2, tlr4, tlr6, tlr7 and tlr10 in bovine neutrophils. in contrast, the presence of mrna transcripts for tlr3 varied between animals, whereas no transcripts were detected for tlr5, tlr8, tlr9 or the c-type lectin receptor dectin-1 in neutrophils isolated from bovine blood. additionally, zymosan, a dectin-1/tlr2 ligand, induced ros, but not rns production in a cd11b-, but not dectin-1-dependent manner. this effect was dependent on store operated calcium entry (soce), and partially inhibited using monoclonal antibodies to cd11b. taken together, our data describe the presence of specific prrs transcripts in the mrna isolated from bovine neutrophil and show a cd11b-/ca(2+) dependent ros production by these cells.
active specific immunotherapy targeting the wilms' tumor protein 1 (wt1) for patients with hematological malignancies and solid tumors: lessons from early clinical trials. the wild-type wilms tumor gene, wt1, is overexpressed in myelodysplastic syndrome (mds) as well as acute myeloid leukemia. in a phase i clinical trial of biweekly vaccination with hla-a*2402-restricted wt1 peptide for these malignancies, 2 patients with mds developed severe leukocytopenia in association with a reduction in leukemic blast cells and levels of wt1 messenger rna (mrna) after only a single vaccination with 0.3 mg of wt1 peptide. these results indicated that the wt1-specific cytotoxic t-lymphocytes (ctls) elicited by wt1 vaccination eradicated the wt1-expressing transformed stem or progenitor cells and that mds patients with little normal hematopoiesis required a new strategy of wt1 vaccination to avoid severe leukocytopenia. we describe the first trial for a 57-year-old male patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia who was vaccinated biweekly with a small quantity (5 microg/body) of wt1 peptide. after the start of vaccination, the leukocyte and monocyte counts (13,780/microl and 1930/microl, respectively) gradually decreased to within the normal range in association with a reduction in the wt1 mrna level. simultaneously, the percentage of wt1-specific ctls as measured by the hla-wt1 tetramer assay increased. this case demonstrates for the first time that vaccination with as little as 5 microg of wt1 peptide can induce wt1-specific immune responses and resultant clinical responses.
induction and inhibition of ciprofloxacin resistance-conferring mutations in hypermutator bacteria the incidence of emergent resistance and clinical factors affecting its development were evaluated by retrospective review of 173 studies encompassing over 14,000 patients. eight antibiotic classes and 225 individual treatment regimens were evaluated. emergent resistance occurred among 4.0% of all organisms and 5.6% of all infections treated. it appeared to be significantly more frequent with penicillin and aminoglycoside monotherapy, with significantly lower rates associated with imipenem‐cilastatin, aztreonam, and combination therapy. clinical failure also appeared to be significantly more likely to occur after emergence of resistance among organisms treated with fluoroquinolones or aminoglycosides. infections associated with higher resistance rates were cystic fibrosis, osteomyelitis, and lower respiratory tract infections. resistance was most common in patients in intensive care units or receiving mechanical ventilation. it was also significantly frequent among studies performed in university or teaching hospitals. organisms associated with high resistance rates were pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia, enterobacter, and acinetobacter sp. factors such as infection type, underlying diseases, type of institution, and specific pathogens warrant consideration when examining emergent resistance.
natural killer cell receptor genes in the family equidae: not only ly49 problem: equine chorionic girdle cells are a subpopulation of highly invasive trophoblast cells that attach and invade the uterine epithelium on day 35 (day 0 = day of ovulation). these invading chorionic girdle cells form endometrial cups that are associated with a marked local maternal leukocytic response that may result in the demise of the cups at day 120 of pregnancy. once endometrial cups become established in the uterine wall they do not express mhc antigens, and therefore may only be susceptible to non‐mhc restricted cytotoxic cells. the susceptibility of cultured chorionic girdle cells to lak cell cytotoxicity was tested in order to evaluate the role of this type of cytotoxicity in the life‐cycle of endometrial cup tissue.
independent roles for the dorsal paraflocculus and vermal lobule vii of the cerebellum in visuomotor coordination summaryfollowing small lesions of the first sensorimotor (msi) and second somatosensory (sii) cortical areas the ensuing degeneration in the inferior olives was studied with the nauta method in 14 cats.no convincing signs of degeneration were found in the olives in cases with lesions restricted to the first and second somatosensory areas (si and sii). following lesions of the primary “motor” cortex (anterior sigmoid gyrus and rostral part of the coronal gyrus) degeneration was consistently found in the olive of both sides. the contralateral projection is somewhat more abundant than the ipsilateral, but both are modest.degeneration is restricted to certain parts of the olivary complex (see fig. 11). lesions restricted to different somatotopical subdivisions of the primary “motor” cortex give rise to degeneration distributed in a somatotopical pattern in certain areas of the medial and dorsal accessory olives and the rostral part of the ventral lamella. somatotopical patterns could not be established in the smaller projections to some other minor olivary regions.when the findings are correlated with the pattern of the olivocerebellar projection it can be concluded that there is a somatotopically organized direct corticoolivo-cerebellar pathway to the intermediate part of the anterior lobe, the posterior vermis and the crus ii.attempts to correlate the findings with physiological observations are difficult. it appears that the current view that climbing fibres arise only in the olive may need revision. the role of the pontine nuclei in mediating somatotopically localized cerebellocerebellar impulses appears to have been underestimated.
molecular cloning and characterization of an nadph quinone oxidoreductase from kluyveromyces marxianus. dt-diaphorase, also referred to as nqo1 or nad(p)h: quinone acceptor oxidoreductase, is a flavoprotein that catalyzes the two-electron reduction of quinones and quinonoid compounds to hydroquinones, using either nadh or nadph as the electron donor. nrh (dihydronicotinamide riboside): quinone oxidoreductase, also referred to as nqo2, has a high nucleotide sequence identity to dt-diaphorase and is considered to be an isozyme of dt-diaphorase. these enzymes transfer two electrons to a quinone, resulting in the formation of a hydroquinone product without the accumulation of a dissociated semiquinone. steady and rapid-reaction kinetic experiments have been performed to determine the reaction mechanism of dt-diaphorase. furthermore, chimeric and site-directed mutagenesis experiments have been performed to determine the molecular basis of the catalytic differences between the two isozymes and to identify the critical amino acid residues that interact with various inhibitors of the enzymes. in addition, functional studies of a natural occurring mutant pro-187 to ser (p187s) have been carried out. results obtained from these investigations are summarized and discussed.
associations among height, body mass index and intelligence from age 11 to age 78 years the association between lifelong body mass index (bmi) and cognitive function has not been comprehensively studied.
a monte carlo simulation based chaotic differential evolution algorithm for scheduling a stochastic parallel processor system this paper presents an application-specific, heterogeneous multiprocessor synthesis system, named hemps, that combines a form of evolutionary computation known as differential evolution with a scheduling heuristic to search the design space efficiently. we demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique by comparing it to similar existing systems. the proposed strategy is shown to be faster than recent systems on large problems while providing equivalent or improved final solutions.
regulation of p27kip1 protein levels contributes to mitogenic effects of the ret/ptc kinase in thyroid carcinoma cells according to current concepts, the cell cycle commitment after restriction (r) point passage requires the sustained stimulation by mitogens of the synthesis of labile d-type cyclins, which associate with cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 4/6 to phosphorylate prb family proteins and sequester the cdk inhibitor p27kip1. in primary cultures of dog thyroid epithelial cells, the camp-dependent cell cycle induced by a sustained stimulation by thyrotropin or forskolin differs from growth factor mitogenic pathways, as camp does not upregulate d-type cyclins but increases p27 levels. instead, camp induces the assembly of required cyclin d3-cdk4 complexes, which associate with nuclear p27. in this study, the arrest of forskolin stimulation rapidly slowed down the entry of dog thyrocytes into s phase and the phosphorylation of prb family proteins. the prb kinase activity, but not the formation, of the cyclin d3-cdk4-p27 complex was strongly reduced. using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, a phosphorylated form of cdk4 was separated. it appeared in response to forskolin and was bound to both cyclin d3 and p27, presumably reflecting the activating thr-172 phosphorylation of cdk4. upon forskolin withdrawal or after cycloheximide addition, this cdk4 phosphoform unexpectedly persisted in p27 complexes devoid of cyclin d3 but it disappeared from the more labile cyclin d3 complexes. these data demonstrate that the assembly of the cyclin d3-cdk4-p27 holoenzyme and the subsequent phosphorylation and activation of cdk4 depend on distinct camp actions. this provides a first example of a crucial regulation of cdk4 phosphorylation by a mitogenic cascade and a novel mechanism of cell cycle control at the r point.
reactive oxygen intermediates and glutathione regulate the expression of cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase during iron-mediated oxidative stress in bean a gene encoding cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase (apxi) from pea (pisum sativum l.) was isolated and its nucleotide sequence determined. by homologous alignment between the apxi cdna (mittler, r., and zilinskas, b. (1991) febs lett. 289, 257-259) and the genomic clone, positions of introns and exons were determined. the isolated apxi gene was found to contain 9 introns, the first of which was located within the 5'-untranslated region of the mrna. southern blot analysis of pea genomic dna suggests that in pea cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase is encoded by a single copy gene. steady state apxi transcript levels were found to increase in response to several stresses imposed by drought, heat, and application of ethephon, abscisic acid, and the superoxide-generating agent paraquat. increases in ascorbate peroxidase activity in response to stresses were less marked than changes observed in transcript levels; cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase protein levels measured by immunoblot analysis remained unchanged.
submicroscopic deletion of 5q involving tumor suppressor genes (ctnna1, hspa9) and copy neutral loss of heterozygosity associated with tet2 and ezh2 mutations in a case of mds with normal chromosome and fish results loss of heterozygosity affecting chromosome 7q is common in acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes, pointing toward the essential role of this region in disease phenotype and clonal evolution. the higher resolution offered by recently developed genomic platforms may be used to establish more precise clinical correlations and identify specific target genes. we analyzed a series of patients with myeloid disorders using recent genomic technologies (1458 by single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays [snp-a], 226 by next-generation sequencing, and 183 by expression microarrays). using snp-a, we identified chromosome 7q loss of heterozygosity segments in 161 of 1458 patients (11%); 26% of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia patients harbored 7q uniparental disomy, of which 41% had a homozygous ezh2 mutation. in addition, we describe an snp-a-isolated deletion 7 hypocellular myelodysplastic syndrome subset, with a high rate of progression. using direct and parallel sequencing, we found no recurrent mutations in typically large deletion 7q and monosomy 7 patients. in contrast, we detected a markedly decreased expression of genes included in our snp-a defined minimally deleted regions. although a 2-hit model is present in most patients with 7q uniparental disomy and a myeloproliferative phenotype, haplodeficient expression of defined regions of 7q may underlie pathogenesis in patients with deletions and predominant dysplastic features.
summation theory ii: characterizations of rπς⁎-extensions and algorithmic aspects we provide algorithms that find, in case of existence, indefinite nested sum extensions in which a (creative) telescoping solution can be expressed with minimal nested depth.
repression of shp-1 expression by p53 leads to trka tyrosine phosphorylation and suppression of breast cancer cell proliferation growth factors of the egf family and their respective erbb/her receptor tyrosine kinases underlie many landmarks of tumor cells, including excessive growth, invasive behavior and attraction of blood vessels. enhanced expression of erbb proteins, existence of permanently active receptor mutants and occurrence of autocrine loops are frequently observed in human cancer, and in some cases they associate with poor disease outcome. the four erbb proteins and their 11 ligands act within a layered signaling network coordinated by erbb-2/her2, the most oncogenic family member. drugs that intercept signals emanating from erbb-2 and erbb-1 are already in routine clinical application. here we review three major strategies to develop new erbb-targeted therapies. these are monoclonal anti-receptor antibodies, specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors and antagonists of heat shock protein 90. the underlying mechanisms are critically examined, with an emphasis on potential drug combinations, which hold promise for enhanced clinical efficacy.
when to stop cpr and when to perform rhythm analysis a study was undertaken to determine the pattern of end-tidal carbon dioxide (etco2) changes during asphyxia-induced cardiac arrest in a pediatric canine model. eleven intubated, anesthetized, paralyzed dogs (mean age, 4.1 mo; mean weight, 5.5 kg) were used. asphyxia was induced by clamping the endotracheal tube (ett) and discontinuing ventilation. cardiac arrest ensued a few minutes later, after which closed-chest cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr) and ventilation were initiated. the etco2 level was recorded at baseline and every minute during cpr. mean baseline etco2 was 31.9 mm hg. the initial etco2 immediately after unclamping the ett (mean, 35 mm hg) was higher than subsequent values (mean, 12.4 mm hg; p < .001). there was a sudden increase in etco2 to a mean of 27.0 mm hg at or just before return of spontaneous circulation (rosc) in all 11 cases (p < .01). during cpr, etco2 levels were initially high, decreased to low levels, and increased again at rosc. this pattern, not previously described, is different from that observed in animal and adult cardiac arrest caused by ventricular fibrillation, during which etco2 decreases to almost zero after the onset of arrest, begins to increase after the onset of effective cpr, and increases to normal levels at rosc. in this model of asphyxial arrest, continued cardiac output prior to arrest allows continued delivery of co2 to the lungs, resulting in higher alveolar co2; this, in turn, is reflected as increased etco2 once ventilation is resumed during cpr. further study is needed to determine whether the pattern of etco2 changes can be used prospectively to define the etiology of cardiac arrest.
red algal mitochondrial genomes are more complete than previously reported over the past several decades, our knowledge of the origin and evolution of mitochondria has been greatly advanced by determination of complete mitochondrial genome sequences. among the most informative mitochondrial genomes have been those of protists (primarily unicellular eukaryotes), some of which harbor the most gene-rich and most eubacteria-like mitochondrial dnas (mtdnas) known. comparison of mtdna sequence data has provided insights into the radically diverse trends in mitochondrial genome evolution exhibited by different phylogenetically coherent groupings of eukaryotes, and has allowed us to pinpoint specific protist relatives of the multicellular eukaryotic lineages (animals, plants, and fungi). this comparative genomics approach has also revealed unique and fascinating aspects of mitochondrial gene expression, highlighting the mitochondrion as an evolutionary playground par excellence.
multiple transcriptional mechanisms control ptf1a levels during neural development including autoregulation by the ptf1-j complex ptf1a is an unusual basic helix-loop-helix (bhlh) transcription factor that is required for the development of the pancreas. we show that early in pancreatic development, active ptf1a requires interaction with rbpj, the vertebrate suppressor of hairless, within a stable trimeric dna-binding complex (ptf1). later, as acinar cell development begins, rbpj is swapped for rbpjl, the constitutively active, pancreas-restricted paralog of rbpj. moreover, the rbpjl gene is a direct target of the ptf1 complex: at the onset of acinar cell development when the rbpjl gene is first induced, a ptf1 complex containing rbpj is bound to the rbpjl promoter. as development proceeds, rbpjl gradually replaces rbpj in the ptf1 complex bound to rbpjl and appears on the binding sites for the complex in the promoters of other acinar-specific genes, including those for the secretory digestive enzymes. a single amino acid change in ptf1a that eliminates its ability to bind rbpj (but does not affect its binding to rbpjl) causes pancreatic development to truncate at an immature stage, without the formation of acini or islets. these results indicate that the interaction between ptf1a and rbpj is required for the early stage of pancreatic growth, morphogenesis, and lineage fate decisions. the defects in pancreatic development phenocopy those of ptf1a-null embryos; thus, the first critical function of ptf1a is in the context of the ptf1 complex containing rbpj. action within an organ-specific transcription factor is a previously unknown function for rbpj and is independent of its role in notch signaling.
genotype and expression analysis of two inbred mouse strains and two derived congenic strains suggest that most gene expression is trans regulated and sensitive to genetic background genetical genomics has been proposed to map loci controlling gene-expression differences (eqtls) that might underlie functional trait variation. we briefly review the studies in model species and conclude that, although they successfully demonstrate the utility of genetical genomics, they are too limited to unlock the full potential of this approach and some results should be interpreted with caution. we subsequently elaborate on two recent studies that use this approach in humans. the many differences between these studies complicate meaningful comparisons between them. a joint analysis of the two experiments offers some scope for more powerful genetical genomics.
associations between individual and combined polymorphisms of the tnf and vegf genes and the embryo implantation rate in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (ivf) programs polymorphic variants on chromosomes are considered 'normal', as heterochromatin has no coding potential and nucleolar organizing regions (nor) contain genes coding for rrna. variants have been reported in infertility and recurrent abortions. with refined molecular techniques, genes for fertility and viability are now thought to reside in heterochromatin. dna sequence analysis of human chromosome 9 has shown that it is highly structurally polymorphic, with many intrachromosomal and interchromosomal duplications, and contains the largest autosomal block of heterochromatin. transcriptional activation of constitutive heterochromatic domains of the human genome in response to environmental stress was reported recently. heat shock triggers the assembly of nuclear stress bodies on the pericentromeric heterochromatin of human chromosomes including chromosome 9. these are characterized by an epigenetic status typical of euchromatic regions. on acrocentric chromosomes, nor-associated protein count and morphology was reported to separate benign and malignant melanocytic lesions. hence all variants may not be 'normal'. the present study of karyotyping 842 individuals attending an ivf clinic with primary infertility or repeated miscarriages, showed polymorphic variants in 28.82% of males and 17.19% of females, which was quite high. it is suggested that variants should not be ignored by cytogeneticists. screening prospective gamete donors for chromosome variants may help enhance the success of ivf.
laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in situs inversus totalis: a case report and comprehensive literature review laparoscopic surgery with situs inversus may pose particular challenges to the surgeon. we discuss a case of undiagnosed situs inversus totalis in a morbidly obese patient undergoing laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (lagb). the patient was a 29-year-old male with a body mass index (bmi) of 56. there was no prior knowledge of his situs inversus totalis, which was only discovered during laparoscopy at the time of surgery. the operative challenges are discussed. lagb was performed successfully without complication. postoperative imaging confirmed dextrocardia and situs inversus totalis, as well as correct gastric band position. however, there has been subsequent gastric band erosion and eventual band removal. we discuss the appropriateness of lagb in this group of patients.
oral tolerance inhibits pulmonary eosinophilia in a cockroach allergen induced model of asthma: a randomized laboratory study several cytokines derived from th3 and tr1 cells, including il-10, are believed to regulate oral tolerance, but direct evidence is lacking. we have explored the potential role of il-10 by generating transgenic (tg) mice with sustained hepatocyte-specific expression of rat il-10. tg mice expressed rat il-10 downstream of a transthyretin promoter, which led to serum levels that were increased 10- to 100-fold compared with normal animals. animals were orally administered 1 mg of whole ova for 5 consecutive days, with control animals receiving pbs. there were six animal groups: either ova or pbs were fed orally to rat il-10 tg mice, non-tg wild-type mice without il-10 administration, and non-tg wild-type mice administered rat il-10 systemically. on day 8, all mice were immunized with two injections of ova, and then analyzed on day 18. t cell proliferation responses were reduced by 65.8 ± 14.3% after feeding of ova in ril-10 tg animals, compared with 39.4 ± 15.6% in the non-tg mice (p = 0.02). anti-ova titers were expressed as fold increase over naive non-tg mice. after feeding, titers decreased by ∼33% (from 3- to 2-fold) in tg animals and, to a lesser extent, in non-tg animals. ifn-γ secretion by cultured popliteal lymphocytes decreased in tg animals by 83% after feeding and by 69% in non-tg animals. il-4 secretion increased 4-fold in tg-fed mice, but did not significantly change in non-tg ova-fed animals. in contrast to hepatic tg expression of ril-10, systemic administration of ril-10 had only a modest effect on tolerance. il-10, when transgenically expressed in the liver enhances mucosal tolerance to an oral ag.
clinical commentary with video sequences gelastic seizures : not always hypothalamic hamartoma an unusual microscopic abnormality has been identified in the lobectomy specimens removed surgically from the brains of 10 epileptic patients. the abnormality could seldom be identified by palpation or with the naked eye. histologically, it consisted of congregations of large, bizarre neurones which were littered through all but the first cortical layer. in most, but not in all cases, grotesque cells, probably of glial origin, were also present in the depths of the affected cortex and in the subjacent white matter. this kind of abnormality appears to be a malformation. the picture is reminiscent of tuberous sclerosis but too many distinguishing features, both in the clinical and in the pathological aspects, make this diagnosis untenable. the cases are therefore looked on provisionally (since all but one are still alive) as comprising a distinct form of cortical dysplasia in which localized, exotic populations of nerve cells underlie the electrical and clinical manifestations of certain focal forms of epilepsy.
the argonaute10 gene modulates shoot apical meristem maintenance and establishment of leaf polarity by repressing mir165/166 in arabidopsis. in higher plants, class i knotted1-like homeobox (knox) gene suppression and leaf polarity establishment are two processes crucial for leaf morphogenesis. the arabidopsis genes, asymmetric leaves1 and 2 (as1 and as2), are required for repressing the class i knox genes and promoting leaf adaxial cell fates. in addition, the rna-dependent rna polymerase6 (rdr6) gene acts synergistically with as1 and as2 to specify the adaxial polarity and repress the knox genes in leaves. it is known that rdr6 is one of the key components in plant post-transcriptional gene silencing (ptgs), and is likely to function with other silencing components in a genetic pathway in regulating leaf patterning. here we report phenotypic analyses of double mutants combining as1 or as2 with other mutations relating to different rna silencing pathways. we show that plants carrying rdr6, suppressor of gene silencing3 (sgs3) or zippy (zip, also called ago7) in combination with as1 or as2 demonstrate severe morphological defects, and the double mutant plants are generally similar to one another. detailed phenotypic and molecular analyses reveal that leaves of rdr6 as2(1), sgs3 as2(1) and zip as2(1) all show an abnormal adaxial identity, and contain high levels of microrna165/166 and filamentous flower (fil) transcripts. these results suggest that rdr6, sgs3 and ago7 act in the same pathway, which genetically interacts with the as1-as2 pathway for leaf development. the rdr6-sgs3-ago7 pathway was previously identified as regulating the plant vegetative phase change. our results reveal a new function of the pathway, which is also required for normal leaf morphogenesis.

cell cycle arrest allows centrin translation but not basal body formation during spermiogenesis in marsilea. and 10 na 3 hp 2 o 7. fv solution also contained 0.2 naf and 0.1 na 3 vo 4. rarely, irreversible current rundown still occurred with fvpp. the total na + concentration of all cytoplasmic solutions was adjusted to 30 mm with naoh, and ph was adjusted to 7.0 with n-methylglucamine (nmg) or hcl. pip 2 liposomes (20–200 nm) were prepared by sonicating 1 mm pip 2 (boehringer mannheim) in distilled water. reconstituted monoclonal pip 2 antibody (perspective biosystems, framingham, ma) was diluted 40-fold into experimental solution. current–voltage relations of all currents reversed at e k and showed characteristic rectification, mostly owing to the presence of na + in fvpp and possibly also residual polyamines. current records presented (measured at 30 њc, −30 mv holding potential) are digitized strip-chart recordings. purified bovine brain gbg 29 was diluted just before application such that the final detergent (chaps) concentration was 5 ␮m. detergent-containing solution was washed away thoroughly before application of pip 2 , because application of phos-pholipid vesicles in the presence of detergent usually reversed the effects of gbg; presumably, gbg can be extracted from membranes by detergent plus phospholipids. molecular biology. r188q mutation was constructed by insertion of the mutant oligonucleotides between the bsm1 and bglii sites of psport– romk1 (ref. 11). a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) fragment (amino acids 180–391) from psport–romk1 r188q mutant was subcloned into pgex-2t vector (pharmacia) for expression of r188q mutant protein of gst–rkc.
skewed x-chromosome inactivation in human miscarriages imprinted inactivation of the paternal x chromosome in marsupials is the primordial mechanism of dosage compensation for x-linked genes between females and males in therians. in eutherian mammals, x chromosome inactivation (xci) evolved into a random process in cells from the embryo proper, where either the maternal or paternal x can be inactivated. however, species like mouse and bovine maintained imprinted xci exclusively in extraembryonic tissues. the existence of imprinted xci in humans remains controversial, with studies based on the analyses of only one or two x-linked genes in different extraembryonic tissues. here we readdress this issue in human term placenta by performing a robust analysis of allele-specific expression of 22 x-linked genes, including xist, using 27 snps in transcribed regions. we show that xci is random in human placenta, and that this organ is arranged in relatively large patches of cells with either maternal or paternal inactive x. in addition, this analysis indicated heterogeneous maintenance of gene silencing along the inactive x, which combined with the extensive mosaicism found in placenta, can explain the lack of agreement among previous studies. our results illustrate the differences of xci mechanism between humans and mice, and highlight the importance of addressing the issue of imprinted xci in other species in order to understand the evolution of dosage compensation in placental mammals.
involvement of tlr2 in recognition of acute gammaherpesvirus-68 infection neutrophils are involved in the initial host response to influenza a virus (iav) infection and exhibit both activation and depressed function after exposure to the virus. we demonstrate that iav causes rapid upregulation of toll‐like receptor 2 (tlr2) expression on neutrophils. the neutrophil agonists, formyl‐methylpleucyl‐alanine (fmlp), c5a and lipopolysaccharide did not alter neutrophil tlr2 expression, whereas pma and the microbial tlr2 ligands, peptidoglycan (pgn) and zymosan, reduced it. to determine the functional significance of iav‐induced increase in tlr2 expression, iav‐treated neutrophils were exposed to pgn, staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and zymosan. pretreatment with iav resulted in significantly increased uptake of s. aureus and zymosan and accelerated neutrophil apoptosis when combined with s. aureus. iav‐treated cells generated significantly more h2o2 in response to pgn. these results indicate that iav increases neutrophil surface expression of tlr2 and modulates functional responses to ligands that bind tlr2. these findings may clarify iav‐induced perturbation of neutrophil functions in vivo.
mechanisms underlying the transformation of disparity signals from v1 to v2 in the macaque one of the fundamental challenges of binocular vision is that objects project to different positions on the two retinas (binocular disparity). neurons in visual cortex show two distinct types of tuning to disparity, position and phase disparity, which are the results of differences in receptive field location and profile, respectively. here, we point out that phase disparity does not occur in natural images. why, then, should the brain encode it? we propose that phase-disparity detectors help to work out which feature in the left eye corresponds to a given feature in the right. this correspondence problem is plagued by false matches: regions of the image that look similar, but do not correspond to the same object. we show that phase-disparity neurons tend to be more strongly activated by false matches. thus, they may act as 'lie detectors', enabling the true correspondence to be deduced by a process of elimination.
laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: the learning curve of a low volume surgeon background we previously reported the learning curve for open radical prostatectomy, reporting large decreases in recurrence rates with increasing surgeon experience. here we aim to characterise the learning curve for laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.   methods we did a retrospective cohort study of 4702 patients with prostate cancer treated laparoscopically by one of 29 surgeons from seven institutions in europe and north america between january, 1998, and june, 2007. multivariable models were used to assess the association between surgeon experience at the time of each patient's operation and prostate-cancer recurrence, with adjustment for established predictors.   findings after adjusting for case mix, greater surgeon experience was associated with a lower risk of recurrence (p=0.0053). the 5-year risk of recurrence decreased from 17% to 16% to 9% for a patient treated by a surgeon with 10, 250, and 750 prior laparoscopic procedures, respectively (risk difference between 10 and 750 procedures 8.0%, 95% ci 4.4-12.0). the learning curve for laparoscopic radical prostatectomy was slower than the previously reported learning curve for open surgery (p<0.001). surgeons with previous experience of open radical prostatectomy had significantly poorer results than those whose first operation was laparoscopic (risk difference 12.3%, 95% ci 8.8-15.7).   interpretation increasing surgical experience is associated with substantial reductions in cancer recurrence after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, but improvements in outcome seem to accrue more slowly than for open surgery. laparoscopic radical prostatectomy seems to involve skills that do not translate well from open radical prostatectomy.   funding national cancer institute, the allbritton fund, and the david j koch foundation.
minimally invasive plate fixation of the tibia objective to describe the extraosseous blood supply of the tibia and how the blood supply of the distal tibia is influenced by different plating techniques. design microdissection of cadaveric adult hip disarticulation specimens following sequential arterial injections of india ink and ward's blue latex was performed. readily identifiable arterioles measured approximately 0.5 mm in diameter. their artery of origin was identified, and their position along the medial, lateral, and posterior aspects of the tibia was documented relative to the tibial plafond. additionally, six matched pairs of limbs were used to assess the effects of different plating techniques on the extraosseous blood supply along the medial aspect of the distal tibia. setting university anatomy laboratory. patients/participants nine matched pairs (n = 18) of randomly obtained, adult cadaveric hip disarticulation specimens. intervention india ink followed by ward's blue latex was injected into the superficial femoral artery at the level of the inguinal crease after cleansing of the arterial system. the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscles were dissected from the leg, exposing the arterial system and the extraosseous vessels of the tibia. mean outcome measurements the extraosseous blood supply of each aspect of the tibial diaphysis was determined. each extraosseous arteriole was identified, and the locations of each documented relative to the tibial plafond. changes in the filling of these vessels along the medial aspect of the distal tibia were documented in a separate group of specimens (n = 12), which had undergone two different plating techniques. results the proximal metaphysis of the tibia was found to have a rich extraosseous blood supply provided primarily from vessels from the popliteal artery, the anterior tibial artery (ata) laterally, and the posterior tibial artery (pta) medially. in comparison, the tibial diaphysis was found to have relatively few extraosseous vessels and a considerably hypovascular region, posteriorly. branches of the ata were found to supply the posterior aspect of the diaphysis with these branches passing through the interosseous membrane. the diaphysis also received a variable contribution from the pta. the lateral aspect of the diaphysis was supplied by branches of the ata. an anastomotic network of arteries from the ata and pta formed the rich extraosseous blood supply of the medial distal aspect of the tibia. open plating of the medial aspect of the distal tibia caused a statistically significant (p < 0.05) greater disruption of the extraosseous blood supply of the metaphyseal region than did percutaneously applied plates. in each specimen, open plating prevented filling of each periosteal vessel in the region as opposed to percutaneous plates, which permitted filling of the extraosseous vessels up to the edge of the plate. conclusions the proximal and distal metaphyseal areas of the tibia have a rich extraosseous blood supply provided primarily by branches of the ata and the pta. open plating of the medial aspect of the distal tibia caused a greater disruption of this extraosseous blood supply than did percutaneously applied plates. disruption of these extraosseous vessels following fracture and subsequent operative stabilization may slow healing and increase the risk of delayed union and nonunion. these findings support current efforts to develop less invasive methods and implants for operative stabilization of distal tibia fractures.
the antimicrobial triclocarban stimulates embryo production in the freshwater mudsnail potamopyrgus antipodarum. the antimicrobial compound triclocarban (tcc; 3,4,4'-trichlorocarbanilide; cas# 101-20-2) is a high-production-volume chemical, recently suggested to cause widespread contamination of us water resources. to test this hypothesis, we developed an isotope dilution liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry method for ultratrace analysis of tcc (0.9 ng/l detection limit) and analyzed low-volume water samples (200 ml) along with primary sludge samples from across the united states. all river water samples (100%) collected downstream of wastewater treatment plants had detectable levels of tcc, as compared to 56% of those taken upstream. concentrations of tcc (mean+/-standard deviation) downstream of sewage treatment plants (84+/-110 ng/l) were significantly higher (p<0.05; wilcoxon rank sum test) than those of samples taken upstream (12+/-15 ng/l). compared to surface water, mean tcc concentrations found in dried, primary sludge obtained from municipal sewage treatment plants in five states were six orders of magnitude greater (19,300+/-7100 microg/kg). several river samples contained a co-contaminant, identified based on its chromatographic retention time, molecular base ion, and ms/ms fragmentation behavior as 4,4'-dichlorocarbanilide (dcc; cas# 1219-99-4). in addition to tcc and dcc, municipal sludge contained a second co-contaminant, 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorocarbanilide (tetracc; cas# 4300-43-0). both newly detected compounds were present as impurities (0.2%(w/w) each) in technical grade tcc (99%). application of the new method for chlorocarbanilide analysis yielded tcc occurrence data for 13 us states, confirmed the role of sewage treatment plants as environmental inputs of tcc, and identified dcc and tetracc as previously unrecognized pollutants released into the environment alongside tcc.
a cardioprotective role for platelet-activating factor through nos-dependent s-nitrosylation. nitric oxide (no) can directly modulate cardiac contractility by accelerating relaxation and reducing diastolic tone. the intracellular mechanisms underlying these contractile effects are poorly understood. here we investigate the role of cyclic gmp‐dependent protein kinase (pkg) in the contractile response to exogenous no in rat ventricular myocytes. isolated ventricular myocytes were stimulated electrically and contractility was assessed by measuring cell shortening. some cells were loaded with the fluorescent ca2+ probe indo‐1 am for simultaneous assessment of the intracellular ca2+ transient. the no donor diethylamine nonoate (dea/no, 10 μm) significantly increased resting cell length, reduced twitch amplitude and accelerated time to 50 % relaxation (to 100.8 ± 0.2, 83.7 ± 3.0 and 88.9 ± 3.7 % of control values, respectively). the contractile effects of dea/no occurred without significant changes in the amplitude or kinetics of the intracellular ca2+ transient, suggesting that the myofilament response to ca2+ was reduced. these effects were abolished by inhibition of either guanylyl cyclase (with 1h‐[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3‐a]quinoxalin‐1‐one; odq, 10 μm) or pkg (with rp‐8‐br‐cgmps, 10 μm) suggesting that, at the concentration investigated, the effects of dea/no were mediated exclusively by pkg, following activation of guanylyl cyclase and elevation of cgmp. direct activation of pkg with 8‐pcpt‐cgmp (10 μm) mimicked the effects of dea/no (resting cell length and time to 50 % relaxation were 100.6 ± 0.1 and 90.5 ± 1.5 % of control values, respectively).the reduced myofilament ca2+ responsiveness was not attributable to an intracellular acidosis since the small reduction in phi induced by dea/no was found to be uncoupled from its contractile effects. however, hearts treated with dea/no (10 μm) showed a significant increase (1.4‐fold; p < 0.01) in troponin i phosphorylation compared to control, untreated hearts. these results suggest that the reduction in myofilament ca2+ responsiveness produced by dea/no results from phosphorylation of troponin i by pkg.
acute hemodynamic effects of angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibition after prolonged cardiac arrest with bretschneider’s solution background angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) produces angiotensin ii, causing vasoconstriction of coronary arteries and reduction of coronary blood flow. the present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that an ace inhibitor increases coronary blood flow and improves myocardial metabolic and contractile functions of ischemic myocardium.   methods and results in 65 open-chest dogs, the left anterior descending coronary artery was perfused through an extracorporeal bypass tube from the left carotid artery. when cilazaprilat (3 micrograms/kg per minute) was infused into the bypass tube for 10 minutes after reduction of coronary blood flow due to partial occlusion of the bypass tube, coronary blood flow increased from 30 +/- 1 to 43 +/- 2 ml/100 g per minute despite there being no changes in coronary perfusion pressure (43 +/- 1 mm hg). the ratio of myocardial endocardial flow to epicardial flow increased during an infusion of cilazaprilat. both fractional shortening and lactate extraction ratio of the perfused area were increased (fractional shortening: 4.1 +/- 0.6% to 8.9 +/- 0.6%, p < .001; lactate extraction ratio: -55.7 +/- 3.3% to -36.7 +/- 3.9%, p < .001). during an infusion of cilazaprilat, the bradykinin concentration of coronary venous blood was markedly increased. the increased coronary blood flow due to cilazaprilat was attenuated by hoe-140 (an inhibitor of bradykinin receptors; coronary blood flow: 35 +/- 2 ml/100 g per minute), and by n omega-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase; coronary blood flow: 34 +/- 2 ml/100 g per minute). intracoronary administration of bradykinin mimicked the beneficial effects of cilazaprilat. cyclic gmp content of the coronary artery was increased by cilazaprilat compared with the untreated condition in the ischemic myocardium. in the denervated hearts, the increased coronary blood flow due to cilazaprilat was not attenuated. on the other hand, cv11974, an inhibitor of angiotensin ii receptors, slightly increased coronary blood flow to 34 +/- 2 from 30 +/- 1 ml/100 g per minute.   conclusions we conclude that an inhibitor of ace can increase coronary blood flow and ameliorate myocardial ischemia, primarily due to accumulation of bradykinin and production of nitric oxide from the ischemic myocardium. inhibition of angiotensin ii production due to inhibition of ace partially contributes to coronary vasodilation in the ischemic myocardium.
histone deacetylases 1 and 2 are required for brain development. histone deacetylases (hdacs) modulate chromatin structure and transcription, but little is known about their function in mammalian development. hdac1 was implicated previously in the repression of genes required for cell proliferation and differentiation. here we show that targeted disruption of both hdac1 alleles results in embryonic lethality before e10.5 due to severe proliferation defects and retardation in development. hdac1‐deficient embryonic stem cells show reduced proliferation rates, which correlate with decreased cyclin‐associated kinase activities and elevated levels of the cyclin‐dependent kinase inhibitors p21waf1/cip1 and p27kip1. similarly, expression of p21 and p27 is up‐regulated in hdac1‐null embryos. in addition, loss of hdac1 leads to significantly reduced overall deacetylase activity, hyperacetylation of a subset of histones h3 and h4 and concomitant changes in other histone modifications. the expression of hdac2 and hdac3 is induced in hdac1‐deficient cells, but cannot compensate for loss of the enzyme, suggesting a unique function for hdac1. our study provides the first evidence that a histone deacetylase is essential for unrestricted cell proliferation by repressing the expression of selective cell cycle inhibitors.
evidence for source–sink dynamics in a regional population of arctic ground squirrels (urocitellus parryii plesius) nous avons etudie les sousliks arctiques (urocitellus parryii plesius (osgood, 1900); anterieurement spermophilus parryii plesius osgood, 1900) dans trois types d'habitat distincts (la foret boreale, les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines) dans la region de kluane dans le sud-ouest du territoire du yukon, canada, de 2008 a 2010, afin de determiner si les populations de ces differents habitats presentaient des repartitions et des abondances specifiques aux habitats. on a demontre que leur abondance dans la foret boreale est synchronisee avec le cycle des lievres d'amerique (lepus americanus erxleben, 1777) dans la region a cause de leurs predateurs communs. nous avons predit que les populations dans la foret boreale devraient etre basses a cause du minimum actuel dans le cycle des lievres d'amerique, mais que les sousliks devraient etre relativement abondants dans les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines. les densites en fin d'ete differaient significativement entre les divers types d'habitats, avec 0,38 ± 0.13 souslik/ha (moyenne ± 1 es) dans l'habitat de foret boreale, 1,25 ± 0,22 souslik/ha dans l'habitat de prairie basse et 5,7 ± 0,22 sousliks/ha dans l'habitat de prairie alpine. en 2009, les populations ont ete extirpees de l'habitat de foret boreale, alors que les densites dans les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines etaient respectivement de 1,6 ± 0,34 souslik/ha et de 6,1 ± 0,7 sousliks/ha. l'absence actuelle de sousliks dans la foret boreale et la persistance des populations dans les prairies de basse altitude et les prairies alpines laissent croire a l'existence d'une dynamique de type source-puits entre les types d'habitats de foret boreale et de prairie.
incidence and risk factors of injuries in brazilian elite handball players: a prospective cohort study overuse injuries may represent as much of a problem as do acute injuries in many sports. this paper reviews key concepts related to the methodology for recording overuse symptoms. results from the fivb volleyball injury study were used to compare two different recording methods. the aim of this paper was to provide recommendations on how standardised methodology can be developed to quantify overuse injuries in surveillance studies. using beach volleyball data, a “traditional” cohort study approach using a time-loss injury definition suggested that injury risk was very low. in contrast, the data from a survey of past and present pain problems in the shoulder, knees and low back demonstrated that these were prevalent. the following recommendations are made: (1) studies should be prospective, with continuous or serial measurements of symptoms; (2) valid and sensitive scoring instruments need to be developed to measure pain and other relevant symptoms; (3) prevalence and not incidence should be used to report injury risk; (4) severity should be measured based on functional level and not time loss from sports. in conclusion, new approaches are needed to develop more appropriate methodology to quantify overuse injuries in studies.
a probabilistic eulerian approach for motion planning of a large-scale swarm of robots swarm robotics is an approach to collective robotics that takes inspiration from the self-organized behaviors of social animals. through simple rules and local interactions, swarm robotics aims at designing robust, scalable, and flexible collective behaviors for the coordination of large numbers of robots. in this paper, we analyze the literature from the point of view of swarm engineering: we focus mainly on ideas and concepts that contribute to the advancement of swarm robotics as an engineering field and that could be relevant to tackle real-world applications. swarm engineering is an emerging discipline that aims at defining systematic and well founded procedures for modeling, designing, realizing, verifying, validating, operating, and maintaining a swarm robotics system. we propose two taxonomies: in the first taxonomy, we classify works that deal with design and analysis methods; in the second taxonomy, we classify works according to the collective behavior studied. we conclude with a discussion of the current limits of swarm robotics as an engineering discipline and with suggestions for future research directions.
a multi-threading architecture to support interactive visual exploration simvis is a novel technology for the interactive visual analysis of large and complex flow data which results from computational fluid dynamics (cfd) simulation. the new technology which has been researched and developed over the last years at the vrvis research center in vienna, introduces a new approach for interactive graphical exploration and analysis of time-dependent data (computed on large three-dimensional grids, and resulting in a multitude of different scalar/vector values for each cell of these grids). in this paper the major new technological concepts of the simvis approach are presented and real-world application examples are given.
biotic and abiotic degradation of pesticide dufulin in soils pentachlorophenol (pcp) contamination is a severe environmental problem due to its widespread occurrence, toxicity and recalcitrance. in order to gain a better understanding of the fate of pcp in soils, the role of the soil organic matter (som) and clay minerals in the pcp sorption-desorption was studied on two bulk field soils, two subsoils (i.e., som or clay-removed soil) and two artificial soils. the two field soils used were a silty loam from new mexico (nm) containing 10% clay and a sandy-clay-loam from colombia (co) south america comprised of 18% clay minerals. the bulk co soil containing kaolinite sorbed significantly less pcp than the nm soil. all soils depicted an apparent hysteresis during sorption. the co bulk and subsoils desorbed 14-20% and 15-26% of the sorbed pcp respectively whereas the nm bulk and subsoils desorbed only 4-12% and 5-16%, respectively. experiments conducted with pure clay and artificial soils indicated that the expandable clay minerals were key sorbent material. additional studies to investigate the interaction between som and clay minerals are needed to fully understand sorptive phenomena.
hemostatic potential of latex proteases from tabernaemontana divaricata (l.) r. br. ex. roem. and schult. and artocarpus altilis (parkinson ex. f.a. zorn) forsberg latex glycoprotein (lgp) from synadenium grantii latex was purified by the combination of heat precipitation and gel permeation chromatography. lgp is a heat stable protein even at 80 degrees c showed a sharp single band both in sds-page as well as in native (acidic) page. lgp is a monomeric protein appears as single band under reducing condition. it is a less hydrophobic protein showed sharp single peak in rp-hplc with retention time of 13.3 m. the relative molecular mass of lgp is 34.4 kda. cd spectrum of lgp explains less content of alpha-helix (7%), and high content of beta-pleated sheets (48%) and random coils (46%). the n-terminal sequence of lgp is d-f-p-s-d-w-y-a-y-e-g-y-v-i-d-r-p-f-s. purified lgp is a fibrinogen degrading protease hydrolyses all the three subunits in the order of aalpha, bbeta and gamma. the hydrolytic pattern is totally different from plasmin as well as thrombin. lgp reduces recalcification time from 165 to 30 s with citrated human plasma but did not show thrombin like as well as factor xa-like activity. although lgp induces procoagulant activity, it hydrolyses partially cross-linked fibrin clot. it hydrolyses all the subunits of partially cross-linked fibrin clot (alpha- chains, beta-chain and gamma-gamma dimer). lgp is a serine protease, inhibited by pmsf. other serine protease inhibitors, aprotinin and leupeptin did not inhibit the caseinolytic activity as well as fibrinogenolytic activity. we report purification and characterization of a glycoprotein from synadenium grantii latex with human fibrino(geno)lytic activity.
executive function in high-functioning autism: decision-making consistency as a characteristic gambling behaviour the emotional responses elicited by the way options are framed often results in lack of logical consistency in human decision making. in this study, we investigated subjects with autism spectrum disorder (asd) using a financial task in which the monetary prospects were presented as either loss or gain. we report both behavioral evidence that asd subjects show a reduced susceptibility to the framing effect and psycho-physiological evidence that they fail to incorporate emotional context into the decision-making process. on this basis, we suggest that this insensitivity to contextual frame, although enhancing choice consistency in asd, may also underpin core deficits in this disorder. these data highlight both benefits and costs arising from multiple decision processes in human cognition.
identification and biochemical characterization of adenylate kinase 1 from clonorchis sinensis the hydrogenosomal enzyme atp:amp phosphotransferase (adenylate kinase) (ec 2.7.4.3) was purified to apparent homogeneity from the bovine parasite tritrichomonas foetus. a fraction enriched for hydrogenosomes was obtained from cell homogenates which had been subjected to differential and isopycnic centrifugation. adenylate kinase was solubilized in 50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.3, containing 0.8% triton x-100, and purified by sequential affi-gel blue affinity chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography gel filtration. the purified enzyme, a monomer of mr 29,000, exhibited km values of 100, 195, and 83 microm for adp, atp, and amp, respectively. substituting other mono-, di-, and trinucleotides for amp, adp, and atp gave less than half the maximal activity. full enzyme activity requires mg2+, but mn2+ and co2+ yield half maximal activity. the enzyme has a broad optimal ph range between ph 6 and 9. the enzyme was competitively inhibited by p1,p5-di(adenosine-5')pentaphosphate, a specific adenylate kinase inhibitor: the ki was 150 nm. the enzyme was also inhibited with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and this inhibition could be reversed by the addition of 2 mm dithiothreitol. t. foetus adenylate kinase has similar catalytic and physical properties to that of the biologically closely related human parasite trichomonas vaginalis.
computational models with thermodynamic and composition features improve sirna design the crystal structure based model of the catalytic center of ago2 revealed that the sirna and the mrna must be able to form an a-helix for correct positing of the scissile phosphate bond for cleavage in rnai. this suggests that base pairing of the target mrna with itself, i.e. secondary structure, must be removed before cleavage. early on in the sirna design, gc-rich target sites were avoided because of their potential to be involved in strong secondary structure. it is still unclear how important a factor mrna secondary structure is in rnai. however, it has been established that a difference in the thermostability of the ends of an sirna duplex dictate which strand is loaded into the rna-induced silencing complex. here, we use a novel secondary structure prediction method and duplex-end differential calculations to investigate the importance of a secondary structure in the sirna design. we found that the differential duplex-end stabilities alone account for functional prediction of 60% of the 80 sirna sites examined, and that secondary structure predictions improve the prediction of site efficacy. a total of 80% of the non-functional sites can be eliminated using secondary structure predictions and duplex-end differential.
evaluation of in vitro cross-reactivity to avian h5n1 and pandemic h1n1 2009 influenza following prime boost regimens of seasonal influenza vaccination in healthy human subjects: a randomised trial although scarce after annual influenza vaccination, b cells producing antibodies capable of neutralizing multiple influenza strains are abundant in humans infected with pandemic 2009 h1n1 influenza.
expression of the opioid growth factor-opioid growth factor receptor axis in human ovarian cancer. opioid growth factor (ogf) is an endogenous pentapeptide that inhibits growth of human pancreatic cancer cells in culture, as well as xenografts in nude mice. to establish the maximum tolerated dose (mtd), and determine safety and toxicity of ogf, a phase i trial was performed in patients with advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer. patients with unresectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma were treated with escalating doses of ogf for 30 min i.v. to determine the mtd. the s.c. route of administration also was evaluated. once the mtd was established, a group of patients was treated chronically, and monitored for safety and toxicity. hypotension was the dose-limiting toxicity, resulting in a mtd of 250 μg/kg i.v. due to limited solubility of ogf in small volumes, a maximum dose of 50 μg/kg twice daily was determined by the s.c. route of administration. no adverse events were reported for oxygen saturation, cardiac rhythm, laboratory values or neurological status in either the acute or chronic parts of the study with the i.v. or s.c. routes. during the chronic i.v. phase, two subjects had resolution of liver metastases and one showed regression of the pancreatic tumor. mean survival from the time of diagnosis was 8.7 months (range 2–23 months) in the i.v. group and 9.5 months (range 1–18 months) in the s.c. group. we conclude that ogf can be safely administered to patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. further studies are needed to determine the efficacy of ogf alone or in combination with present modes of therapy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
retina homozygosity for a recessive loss-of-function mutation of the nrl gene is associated with a variant of enhanced scone syndrome purpose at lower stimulus intensities, the amplitude of the photopic flash erg b-wave increases with increasing stimulus intensities, but then plateaus and decreases at higher stimulus intensities (the "photopic hill"). the purpose of this study was to determine the mechanism underlying this unusual phenomenon.   methods five adult monkeys (macaca mulatta and m. fascicularis) were studied. stimuli were obtained from xenon strobe flashes, and the intensity was reduced by neutral-density filters in 0.4-log unit steps. n-methyl-d-aspartic acid and tetrodotoxin citrate (nmda+ttx) were used to suppress inner retinal activities and l-2 amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (apb) and cis-2,3 piperidine dicarboxylic acid (pda) to block postreceptoral on- and off-pathway activities. the postsynaptic on- and off-components were isolated by subtracting the postdrug ergs from the predrug ergs.   results the intensity-response curve of the photopic b-wave obtained after the intravitreal injection of ttx+nmda had the same shape as a photopic hill, suggesting that the contribution from the inner retinal neurons to the photopic hill is not significant. at low and intermediate intensities, the photopic b-wave was mainly shaped by the overlapping of two positive peaks from the on- and off-components. however, the amplitude of the positive peak from the on-component became smaller and broader at higher stimulus intensities. in addition, the timing of the positive peak of the off-component was gradually delayed with increasing intensities. after apb+pda, the remaining cone photoreceptor component contributed only to the negative a-wave at all stimulus intensities.   conclusions the photopic hill in the primate erg results mainly from two factors: the reduction of the on-component amplitude at higher intensities and the delay in the positive peak of the off-component at higher intensities.
ceacam1, an adhesion molecule of human granulocytes, is fucosylated by fucosyltransferase ix and interacts with dc-sign of dendritic cells via lewis x residues. both the dendritic cell receptor dc-sign and the closely related endothelial cell receptor dc-signr bind human immunodeficiency virus and enhance infection. however, biochemical and structural comparison of these receptors now reveals that they have very different physiological functions. by screening an extensive glycan array, we demonstrated that dc-sign and dc-signr have distinct ligand-binding properties. our structural and mutagenesis data explain how both receptors bind high-mannose oligosaccharides on enveloped viruses and why only dc-sign binds blood group antigens, including those present on microorganisms. dc-sign mediates endocytosis, trafficking as a recycling receptor and releasing ligand at endosomal ph, whereas dc-signr does not release ligand at low ph or mediate endocytosis. thus, whereas dc-sign has dual ligand-binding properties and functions both in adhesion and in endocytosis of pathogens, dc-signr binds a restricted set of ligands and has only the properties of an adhesion receptor.

kv1.3 channels regulate synaptic transmission in the nucleus of solitary tract. the active and passive membrane properties of rabbit nodose ganglion cells and their responsiveness to depolarizing agents have been examined in vitro. neurons with an axonal conduction velocity of less than 3 m/s were classified as c-cells and the remainder as a-cells. mean axonal conduction velocities of a- and c-cells were 16.4 m/s and 0.99 m/s, respectively. a-cells had action potentials of brief duration (1.16 ms), high rate of rise (385 v/s), an overshoot of 23 mv, and relatively high spike following frequency (sff). c-cells typically had action potentials with a "humped" configuration (duration 2.51 ms), lower rate of rise (255 v/s), an overshoot of 28.6 mv, an after potential of longer duration than a-cells, and relatively low sff. eight of 15 a-cells whose axons conducted at less than 10 m/s had action potentials of longer duration with a humped configuration; these were termed ah-cells. they formed about 10% of cells whose axons conducted above 2.5 m/s. the soma action potential of a-cells was blocked by tetrodotoxin (ttx), but that of 6/11 c-cells was unaffected by ttx. typically, a-cells showed strong delayed (outward) rectification on passage of depolarizing current through the soma membrane and time-dependent (inward) rectification on inward current passage. input resistance was thus highly sensitive to membrane potential close to rest. in c-cells, delayed rectification was not marked, and slight time-dependent rectification occurred in only 3 of 25 cells; i/v curves were normally linear over the range: resting potential to 40 mv more negative. data on ah-cells were incomplete, but in our sample of eight cells time-dependent rectification was absent or mild. c-cells had a higher input resistance and a higher neuronal capacitance than a-cells. in a proportion of a-cells, rn was low at resting potential (5 m omega) but increased as the membrane was hyperpolarized by a few millivolts. a-cells were depolarized by gaba but were normally unaffected by 5-ht or dmpp. c-cells were depolarized by gaba in a similar manner to a-cells but also responded strongly to 5-ht; 53/66 gave a depolarizing response, and 3/66, a hyperpolarizing response. of c-cells, 75% gave a depolarizing response to dmpp.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
plasma apolipoprotein vldl-ii and egg production in laying hens: establishment of an elisa method. at onset of egg-laying in the chicken, plasma levels of apolipoprotein vldl-ii (apoii) increase dramatically, suggesting a function of apoii in yolk deposition of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. thus, the possibility that this female-specific homodimeric protein (mr of subunit, 9500) is recognized by the oocyte receptor for low and very low density lipoproteins was investigated. apoii was purified from very low density lipoproteins by a novel, rapid procedure and reconstituted with egg phosphatidylcholine (pc) by detergent-dialysis. the resulting discoidal apoii/pc lipoprotein particles contained 3 mg of apoii per mg of pc and had a buoyant density of 1.062 g/ml. the ability of apoii/pc, as well as of physiological particles containing apoii but devoid of apolipoprotein b (apob), namely high density lipoproteins (hdl) from laying hens, to interact with the oocyte receptor was tested. both of these ligands failed to show saturable high affinity binding, in contrast to the apob-containing ligands, low and very low density lipoproteins. furthermore, neither laying-hen hdl which contain apoii and apoa-i nor apoii/pc were able to displace receptor-bound apob-containing lipoproteins, as shown in competitive binding assays as well as by ligand blotting. thus, we conclude that apob, but not apoii, participates in binding and uptake of very low density lipoproteins via receptor-mediated endocytosis by growing chicken oocytes.
genomic and gene-expression comparisons among phage-resistant type-iv pilus mutants of pseudomonas syringae pathovar phaseolicola the genome of the lipid-containing bacteriophage phi 6 contains three segments of double-stranded rna. we have determined the nucleotide sequence of cdna derived from the middle-size rna segment. the coding sequences of three proteins on this segment were identified on the basis of size and the correlation of predicted n-terminal amino acid sequences with those found through the analysis of isolated proteins. in contrast to our results with the small phi 6 dsrna segment, the open reading frames are not tightly clustered. the homologous terminal noncoding regions between the middle and small dsrna segments are found to be more extensive than rna sequencing had previously indicated.
visualizing changes in cdkn1c expression links early-life adversity to imprint mis-regulation in adults monoallelic expression of imprinted genes is generally associated with differential methylation. methylation may be inherited as the gametic imprinting mark or may be acquired postfertilization. here, we characterize a differentially methylated region associated with the mouse cdkn1c gene and find that it is confined to a cpg island that begins 600 bp 5' of the promoter and extends into the transcription unit. our analysis indicates that methylation of this region is not inherited from sperm, is acquired specifically on the paternal allele following implantation, and is dependent on kvdmr1. we further demonstrate that although methylation is required for maintaining silencing of the paternal cdkn1c allele, it is not a prerequisite for the establishment of monoallelic expression at this locus. prior to the onset of differential methylation, additional epigenetic modifications must play a role in distinguishing the parental alleles of cdkn1c and influencing their expression.
smad2 and 3 transcription factors control muscle mass in adulthood. myostatin is a transforming growth factor-β family member that acts as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass. to identify possible myostatin inhibitors that may have applications for promoting muscle growth, we investigated the regulation of myostatin signaling. myostatin protein purified from mammalian cells consisted of a noncovalently held complex of the n-terminal propeptide and a disulfide-linked dimer of c-terminal fragments. the purified c-terminal myostatin dimer was capable of binding the activin type ii receptors, act riib and, to a lesser extent, act riia. binding of myostatin to act riib could be inhibited by the activin-binding protein follistatin and, at higher concentrations, by the myostatin propeptide. to determine the functional significance of these interactions in vivo, we generated transgenic mice expressing high levels of the propeptide, follistatin, or a dominant-negative form of act riib by using a skeletal muscle-specific promoter. independent transgenic mouse lines for each construct exhibited dramatic increases in muscle mass comparable to those seen in myostatin knockout mice. our findings suggest that the propeptide, follistatin, or other molecules that block signaling through this pathway may be useful agents for enhancing muscle growth for both human therapeutic and agricultural applications.
intrapair birthweight discordance in twins. objective to challenge the hypothesis that discordant growth is a normal variation by relating birth weight discordance to total twin birth weight. method among 12,565 israeli live-born twin pairs (1993–98), we compared total twin birth weight decile, the frequencies of three levels of discordance in the general population, over 25% discordance between like- versus unlike-sex pairs, and over 25% discordance between pairs delivered by primiparas versus multiparas. results we found a marked change in the best-fit correlation function with increased discordance: level 15–24.9% was inversely linear whereas levels 25–34.9% and over 34.9% were inversely logarithmic (r2 = .47, .88, and .9, respectively). the best-fit correlation of frequencies of more than 25% discordance was inversely logarithmic and similar in like-and unlike-sexed twins across deciles functions (p = .7, odds ratio [or] 1.0, 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.9, 1.2). the overall frequencies of discordance were also similar (9.3% versus 10.2%, p = .11, or 0.9, 95% ci 0.8, 1.0). the frequencies of primiparas decreased linearly (r2 = .98) and the frequencies of more than 25% discordant pairs in multiparas and primiparas across the deciles had similar inversely logarithmic patterns (p = .55, or 1.0, 95% ci 0.9, 1.2). discordance over 25% was significantly more frequent among primiparas (p < .001, or 1.45, 95% ci 1.3, 1.6). conclusion the observed patterns of birth weight discordance did not substantiate normal variation but an adaptive growth restriction that might explain why the likelihood of discordant growth decreases as total twin birth weight increases.
energy intake from human milk covers the requirement of 6-month-old senegalese exclusively breast-fed infants objective: to measure the lipid content and the fatty acid (fa) composition of breast milk as part of a nutritional survey of the essential fatty acid (efa) status of 5 months old congolese infants.design: cross sectional nutrition survey.setting: a suburban district of brazzaville (capital of the congo).subjects: a random sample of nursing mothers and their 5 months old infants (n=102).data collection procedures: the mothers were questionned on their socio-economic status, dietary habits, and their body mass index (bmi) was measured. breast milk samples were collected from each mother. milk lipid content and fatty acid composition were determined.results: compared with milk from various countries, congolese women's mature breast milk was low in lipid (28.70±11.33 g/l) but rich in 8:0–14:0 fas (25.97±8.17% of total fas) and in polyunsaturated fas (pufas), particularly n-3 pufas (2.39±0.68% of total fas, mainly 18:3 and 22:6). this was associated with the frequent consumption of high-carbohydrate foods (processed cassava roots, wheat bread, doughnuts) known to enhance 8:0–14:0 fa biosynthesis, and with that of foods providing n-6 and n-3 efas such as freshwater and saltwater fish, vegetable oil, green leafy vegetables, and high-fat fruit (peanuts, avocado, bushbutter). these foods were traditionally and locally produced. milk lipid content was negatively related with mothers' bmi (p<0.01) and varied with the frequency of consumption of certain foods corresponding to distinct dietary patterns.conclusions: lipid content and fa composition of congolese breast milk were dependent on mother's nutritional status. however, despite an adequate efa composition of breast milk, partially breast-fed 5 months old congolese infants probably did not get enough n-6 and n-3 efas from breast milk to meet their efa requirements.sponsorship: supported in part by the french ministry of research (contract no. 92.l.0728) and inra (institut national de la recherche agronomique).
a novel inhibitor of smad-dependent transcriptional activation suppresses tissue fibrosis in mouse models of systemic sclerosis. smads regulate transcription of defined genes in response to tgf-beta receptor activation, although the mechanisms of smad-mediated transcription are not well understood. we demonstrate that the tgf-beta-inducible smad3 uses the tumor suppressor smad4/dpc4 and cbp/p300 as transcriptional coactivators, which associate with smad3 in response to tgf-beta. the association of cbp with smad3 was localized to the carboxyl terminus of smad3, which is required for transcriptional activation, and a defined segment in cbp. furthermore, cbp/p300 stimulated both tgf-beta- and smad-induced transcription in a smad4/dpc4-dependent fashion. smad3 transactivation and tgf-beta-induced transcription were inhibited by expressing e1a, which interferes with cbp functions. the coactivator functions and physical interactions of smad4 and cbp/p300 with smad3 allow a model for the induction of gene expression in response to tgf-beta.
raffinose family oligosaccharides act as galactose stores in seeds and are required for rapid germination of arabidopsis in the dark phytochrome interacting factor 3-like5 (pil5) is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that inhibits seed germination by regulating the expression of gibberellin (ga)- and abscisic acid (aba)-related genes either directly or indirectly. it is not yet known, however, whether pil5 regulates seed germination solely through ga and aba. here, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation-chip (chip-chip) analysis to identify 748 novel pil5 binding sites in the arabidopsis thaliana genome. consistent with the molecular function of pil5 as a transcription regulator, most of the identified binding sites are located in gene promoter regions. binding site analysis shows that pil5 binds to its target sites mainly through the g-box motif in vivo. microarray analysis reveals that phytochromes regulate a large number of genes mainly through pil5 during seed germination. comparison between the chip-chip and microarray data indicates that pil5 regulates 166 genes by directly binding to their promoters. many of the identified genes encode transcription regulators involved in hormone signaling, while some encode enzymes involved in cell wall modification. interestingly, pil5 directly regulates many transcription regulators of hormone signaling and indirectly regulates many genes involved in hormone metabolism. taken together, our data indicate that pil5 inhibits seed germination not just through ga and aba, but also by coordinating hormone signals and modulating cell wall properties in imbibed seeds.
rasip1 is essential to blood vessel stability and angiogenic blood vessel growth ras proteins are small gtpases that regulate cellular growth and differentiation. components of the ras signaling pathway have been shown to be important during embryonic vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. here, we report that rasip1, which encodes a novel ras-interacting protein, is strongly expressed in vascular endothelial cells throughout development, in both mouse and frog. similar to the well-characterized vascular markers vegfr2 and pecam, rasip1 is specifically expressed in angioblasts prior to vessel formation, in the initial embryonic vascular plexus, in the growing blood vessels during angiogenesis and in the endothelium of mature blood vessels into the postnatal period. rasip1 expression is undetectable in vegfr2 null embryos, which lack endothelial cells, suggesting that rasip1 is endothelial specific. sirna-mediated reduction of rasip1 severely impairs angiogenesis and motility in endothelial cell cultures, and morpholino knockdown experiments in frog embryos demonstrate that rasip1 is required for embryonic vessel formation in vivo. together, these data identify rasip1 as a novel endothelial factor that plays an essential role in vascular development.
a coupled deformable model for tracking myocardial borders from real-time echocardiography using an incompressibility constraint this study investigated the use of artificial neural networks (ann) for image segmentation and spatial temporal contour linking for the detection of endocardial contours on echocardiographic images. using a backpropagation network, the system was trained with 279 sample regions obtained from eight training images to segment images into either tissue or blood pool region. the ann system was then applied to parasternal short axis images of 38 patients. spatial temporal contour linking was performed on the segmented images to extract endocardial boarders. left ventricular areas (end-systolic and end-diastolic) determined with the automated system were calculated and compared to results obtained by manual contour tracing performed by two independent investigators. in addition, ejection fractions (ef) were derived using the area-length method and compared with radionuclide ventriculography. image quality was classified as good in 12 (32%), moderate in 13 (34%) and poor in 13 (34%) patients. the ann system provided estimates of end-diastolic and end-systolic areas in 36 (89%) of echocardiograms, which correlated well with those obtained by manual tracing (r = 0.99, see = 1.44). a good agreement was also found for the comparison of ef between the ann system and tc-radionuclide ventriculography (rnv, r = 0.93, see = 6.36). the ann system also performed well in the subset of patients with poor image quality. endocardial contour detection using artificial neural networks and spatial temporal contour linking allows accurate calculations of ventricular areas from transthoracic echocardiograms and performs well even in images with poor quality. this system could greatly enhance the feasibility, accuracy and reproducibility of calculating cardiac areas to derive left ventricular volumes and ejection fractions.
importance of binocular vision in foot placement accuracy when stepping onto a floor-based target during gait initiation in comparison to lateral judgments of distance, stereoscopic judgments are not precise. although stereoacuity thresholds for targets presented in the fixation plane can equal the best thresholds for the monocular hyperacuities, i.e. a few sec arc, the increment thresholds for disparity are substantially larger than the increment thresholds for lateral separation (width). we measured the minimum detectable change in the three-dimensional distance separating two features, one presented in the fixation plane, and the other some distance in front of it, i.e. with a significant standing disparity between the two features. for briefly-presented targets (150 msec), the weber fraction for disparity was 10-20% over the range from 1 to 20 min arc, while the weber fraction for width was only 2-3% under comparable conditions. the disparity thresholds were substantially improved for a longer duration target (1000 msec), but they were still a factor of two worse than the monocular width thresholds. in a related experiment, the vernier acuity for a standard vernier target was profoundly degraded by pairing the offset upper line presented to one eye with a disparate line in the other eye; the vernier threshold was elevated for disparities ranging from 3 to 30 min arc. this finding shows that the more precise monocular signals are actively suppressed in fused or partially-fused stereoscopic images.
risk associations of melanoma in a southern european population: results of a case/control study different pigmentary characteristics as well as different parameters of sun exposure have previously been identified as risk factors for developing cutaneous melanoma. the aim of the present study was to identify significant risk factors, determine the related magnitude of their estimated relative risks, and define criteria for the detection of persons at risk. five hundred thirteen melanoma patients and 498 controls matched for age and sex underwent a whole-body examination for the number and type of melanocytic lesions and were interviewed on ultraviolet exposure and other potential risk factors. the total number of common melanocytic nevi on all body sites represented the most important risk factor in multiple logistic regression analysis with a relative risk of 7.6 for subjects with more than 100 versus no more than 10 melanocytic nevi. other significant independent risk factors were the number of atypical melanocytic nevi (relative risk, 6.1 for at least 5 melanocytic nevi versus none), the number of actinic lentigines (relative risk, 3.5 for many versus none), hair color, skin type, and reported melanocytic nevus growth. no single parameter of sun exposure was significantly related to melanoma risk in the multivariate analysis. groups with an estimated relative risk between 1 and 121.0 were distinguished by considering common and atypical melanocytic nevi as well as actinic lentigines as the decisive criteria. in conclusion, even without any information on the case history, whole-body examination and diagnosis of pigmented lesions was found to be an effective strategy for identifying persons at risk of developing melanoma. furthermore, clinical recognition of at least 5 atypical melanocytic nevi without histologic examination is a key for identifying subjects at high risk.
structural determinants for alternative splicing regulation of the mapt pre-mrna we have determined the sequences of isoforms of human tau protein, which differ from previously reported forms by insertions of 29 or 58 amino acids in the amino-terminal region. complementary dna cloning shows that the insertions occur in combination with both three and four tandem repeats. rnaase protection assays indicate that transcripts encoding isoforms with the insertions are expressed in an adult-specific manner. transcripts encoding four tandem repeats are also expressed in an adult-specific manner, whereas mrnas encoding three tandem repeats are expressed throughout life, including in fetal brain. the levels of transcripts encoding the 29 or 58 amino acid inserts were not significantly changed in cerebral cortex from patients with alzheimer's disease. antisera raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to these different human tau isoforms demonstrate that multiple tau protein isoforms are incorporated into the neurofibrillary tangles of alzheimer's disease.
functional implications of genetic interactions between genes encoding small gtpases involved in vesicular transport in yeast the ypt2 gene of the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe encodes a member of the ypt/rab family of small gtp-binding proteins, related in sequence to sec4p of saccharomyces cerevisiae but closer to mammalian rab8. we have introduced a mutation into the gene corresponding to a mutation identified in ypt1, in which a conserved valine residue was altered to asparagine. the mutated ypt2 gene was introduced into the s. pombe genome by gene replacement. the resulting strain was temperature-sensitive for growth. normal growth was restored by introduction of a plasmid-borne wild-type ypt2 cdna or by cdna for rab8 but not by various other rab or ypt sequences. at restrictive temperature the mutant cells accumulated the secretory protein acid phosphatase in a form that appeared to be fully glycosylated and acquired a population of vesicles detectable by electron microscopy. thus the ypt2 protein, and by inference rab8, appear to function in the last stage of the secretory pathway.
deconstruction and other approaches to supersymmetric lattice field theories we present preliminary numerical results from a lattice study of the two-dimensional o(3) non-linear sigma model. in the continuum this model possesses n =2 supersymmetry. the lattice formulation we use retains an exact (twisted) supersymmetry except for a soft breaking associated with a wilson mass term needed to remove the doubles. our numerical results show that the partition function is independent of coupling as predicted by supersymmetry.
programmed death‐1/b7‐h1 negative costimulation protects mouse liver against ischemia and reperfusion injury the proto-oncogene bcl-2 and a bcl-2-related gene bcl-x prevent apoptotic cell death induced by various treatments. although a mechanism has been proposed that involves bcl-2 activity on reactive oxygen species (ros), we find that expression of bcl-2 or bcl-xl prevents cell death induced by withdrawal of oxygen (hypoxia) and that the cell death does not involve ros, suggesting that bcl-2 or bcl-xl exerts an anti-cell death function by a mechanism other than through regulation of ros activity. using electron microscopy, and confocal and non-confocal fluorescence microscopy, we show that hypoxia induces both necrosis and apoptosis. overexpression of bcl-2 or bcl-xl blocks hypoxia-induced apoptosis and, although to a lesser extent, necrosis. the anti-apoptotic proteins bcl-2 and bcl-xl effectively inhibit kcn-induced cell death which is characterized by necrotic features including apparently intact chromatin, remarkable mitochondrial swelling with loss of crista structure and loss of plasma membrane integrity. the necrotic cell death is also inhibited by inhibitors of ice (interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme)(-like) proteases, the common mediators of apoptosis. these results indicate that bcl-2/bcl-xl and ice(-like) proteases modulate both apoptotic and at least some forms of necrotic cell death, suggesting that both cell death pathways involve some common mediators.
a rice fungal mamp-responsive mapk cascade regulates metabolic flow to antimicrobial metabolite synthesis arabidopsis map kinase 4 (mpk4) functions as a regulator of pathogen defense responses, because it is required for both repression of salicylic acid (sa)‐dependent resistance and for activation of jasmonate (ja)‐dependent defense gene expression. to understand mpk4 signaling mechanisms, we used yeast two‐hybrid screening to identify the mpk4 substrate mks1. analyses of transgenic plants and genome‐wide transcript profiling indicated that mks1 is required for full sa‐dependent resistance in mpk4 mutants, and that overexpression of mks1 in wild‐type plants is sufficient to activate sa‐dependent resistance, but does not interfere with induction of a defense gene by ja. further yeast two‐hybrid screening revealed that mks1 interacts with the wrky transcription factors wrky25 and wrky33. wrky25 and wrky33 were shown to be in vitro substrates of mpk4, and a wrky33 knockout mutant was found to exhibit increased expression of the sa‐related defense gene pr1. mks1 may therefore contribute to mpk4‐regulated defense activation by coupling the kinase to specific wrky transcription factors.
vegf189 expression is highly related to adaptation of the plateau pika (ochotona curzoniae) inhabiting high altitudes. lung development and repair of hyperoxic injury require closely regulated growth and regeneration of alveolar capillaries. vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf), a mitogen for endothelial cells, is expressed by alveolar epithelial cells. alternative splicing of vegf mrna results in isoforms of varying mitogenicity and solubility. we examined changes in the proportions of the vegf splice variant mrnas in rabbit lung development and in control, oxygen-injured, and recovering newborn and adult rabbit lungs. the proportion of the 189-amino acid vegf mrna, which codes for an isoform that binds to the extracellular matrix, increased fivefold during development (from 8% of total vegf message at 22 days gestation to 40% in 10-day newborn lungs; p < 0.001). during neonatal oxygen injury, its expression declined from 38 to 8% of vegf message (p < 0.002) and returned to the control value in recovery. a similar pattern was observed in adults. vegf protein in lung lavage fluid increased slightly during hyperoxia, declined to barely detectable levels at the 50% lethal dose time point, and increased 10-fold (newborn) or up to 40-fold (adult) in recovering animals. we conclude that alternative splicing may have important roles in the regulation of vegf activity in developing and injured lungs.
increased severity and mortality in adults co-infected with malaria and hiv in maputo, mozambique: a prospective cross-sectional study background malaria is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in sub-saharan africa.   objective the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of malaria among long distance truck drivers in the niger delta of nigeria.   methods a total of one hundred consecutively recruited long distance truck drivers aged 21-60 years, with a mean age of 42.36 ± 5.23 years were screened for the presence of malaria parasitaemia.   results out of the 100 truck drivers screened, 35 (35%) were positive for malaria while 65 (65%) were negative. plasmodium falciparum was responsible for all cases of malaria infection. the highest prevalence of malaria occurred among drivers in the 51-60 years age group (40.5%). the mean and standard deviation (sd) of parasite load was 1 020 (125) parasites/ìl in subjects positive for malaria. the mean cd4 count was significantly higher among non-parasitized truck drivers compared to p. falciparum parasitized drivers 820 ± 42.0 (731-902 cells/ µl) and 570 ± 30.0 (510-630 cells/ µl) respectively (chi square = 74.00; p = 0.03). we observed a significant negative correlation between plasmodial infection and cd4 lymphocyte count among plasmodium falciparum-infected subjects with r = - 0.56 (p= 0.001).   conclusion preventative strategies including regular chemoprophylaxis, intermittent preventive treatment with antimalarials and provision of insecticide-treated bed nets should be implemented.
papillary carcinoma with extensive squamous metaplasia arising from thyroglossal duct cyst in an 11-year-old girl: significance of differentiation from squamous cell carcinoma: a case report. carcinoma within the thyroglossal duct (tgdca) is a very rare pediatric tumor. this report presents the case of a 15-year-old girl with tgdca, reviews the previously published pediatric cases of this tumor, and provides diagnostic and therapeutic considerations in tgdca in children. twenty one cases of tgdca have been reported, 12 of them in females. mean age at presentation was approximately 13 years for females and approximately 12 years for males. the duration of a midcervical mass prior to the diagnosis of tgdca varied from 3 weeks to 8 years. the size of the neck mass at presentation averaged 2 cm-4 cm. all masses were asymptomatic, and the diagnosis of tgdca was incidental following surgery. all pediatric cases of tgdca reported thus far were of the papillary type, except for 3 patients who presented with a mixed papillary-follicular carcinoma. capsular invasion was detected in 10 (45%) patients. local invasive disease was found in 5 (23%) patients, but all removed thyroid glands (12) were free of carcinoma. one patient had lung metastases. thyroidectomy with subsequent radioiodine ablation was the treatment of choice in the majority of the cases. the reported prognosis for tgdca in children was favorable, with only one reported death.
methylation of parp-1 promoter involved in the regulation of benzene-induced decrease of parp-1 mrna expression. exposure to benzene is generally accepted as a cause of acute myeloid leukemia (aml), but the association with other cell types of leukemia and other lymphatic and hematopoietic cancers is controversial. we compiled epidemiologic research on benzene and lymphatic and hematopoietic cancers in order to assess the pattern of associations. eighteen relevant community-based and 16 industry-based studies were located. four of seven studies of lymphatic and hematopoietic cancer in the aggregate identified relative risks of 1.8 or more, and eight of 14 total leukemia studies yielded relative risks in that range. the few available studies of specific histologic types of leukemia do not indicate larger or more consistent elevations in risk for aml compared to other leukemia cell types. sporadic reports have linked benzene to non-hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma, but most studies do not indicate a positive association. limitations in study quality, particularly exposure assessment, pervade all of the studies reviewed, and the distinction between studies addressing benzene and those addressing jobs in industries that use benzene is somewhat arbitrary. nonetheless, the epidemiologic evidence linking benzene to leukemia in the aggregate, as well as for subtypes other than aml, is no less persuasive than that for aml alone.
mapping of a new stem rust resistance gene sr49 in chromosome 5b of wheat key messagewe have demonstrated that genomic selection in diverse wheat landraces for resistance to leaf, stem and strip rust is possible, as genomic breeding values were moderately accurate. markers with large effects in the bayesian analysis confirmed many known genes, while also discovering many previously uncharacterised genome regions associated with rust scores.abstractgenomic selection, where selection decisions are based on genomic estimated breeding values (gebvs) derived from genome-wide dna markers, could accelerate genetic progress in plant breeding. in this study, we assessed the accuracy of gebvs for rust resistance in 206 hexaploid wheat (triticum aestivum) landraces from the watkins collection of phenotypically diverse wheat genotypes from 32 countries. the landraces were genotyped for 5,568 snps using an illumina iselect 9 k bead chip assay and phenotyped for field-based leaf rust (lr), stem rust (sr) and stripe rust (yr) responses across multiple years. genomic best linear unbiased prediction (gblup) and a bayesian regression method (bayesr) were used to predict gebvs. based on fivefold cross-validation, the accuracy of genomic prediction averaged across years was 0.35, 0.27 and 0.44 for lr, sr and yr using gblup and 0.33, 0.38 and 0.30 for lr, sr and yr using bayesr, respectively. inclusion of pcr-predicted genotypes for known rust resistance genes increased accuracy more substantially when the marker was diagnostic (lr34/sr57/yr18) for the presence-absence of the gene rather than just linked (sr2). investigation of the impact of genetic relatedness between validation and reference lines on accuracy of genomic prediction showed that accuracy will be higher when each validation line had at least one close relationship to the reference lines. overall, the prediction accuracies achieved in this study are encouraging, and confirm the feasibility of genomic selection in wheat. in several instances, estimated marker effects were confirmed by published literature and results of mapping experiments using watkins accessions.
development of a model for inducing transient insulin resistance in the mare: preliminary implications regarding the estrous cycle. to examine whether and how intramyocellular lipid (imcl) content contributes to interindividual variation in insulin action, we studied 20 healthy men with no family history of type 2 diabetes. imcl was measured as the resonance of intramyocellular ch(2) protons in lipids/resonance of ch(3) protons of total creatine (imcl/cr(t)), using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in vastus lateralis muscle. whole-body insulin sensitivity was measured using a 120-min euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic (insulin infusion rate 40 mu/m(2). min) clamp. muscle biopsies of the vastus lateralis muscle were taken before and 30 min after initiation of the insulin infusion to assess insulin signaling. the subjects were divided into groups with high imcl (hiimcl; 9.5 +/- 0.9 imcl/cr(t), n = 10) and low imcl (loimcl; 3.0 +/- 0.5 imcl/cr(t), n = 10), the cut point being median imcl (6.1 imcl/cr(t)). the groups were comparable with respect to age (43 +/- 3 vs. 40 +/- 3 years, ns, hiimcl versus loimcl), bmi (26 +/- 1 vs. 26 +/- 1 kg/m(2), ns), and maximal oxygen consumption (33 +/- 2 vs. 36 +/- 3 ml. kg(-1). min(-1), ns). whole-body insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was lower in the hiimcl group (3.0 +/- 0.4 mg. kg(-1). min(-1)) than the loimcl group (5.1 +/- 0.5 mg. kg(-1). min(-1), p < 0.05). serum free fatty acid concentrations were comparable basally, but during hyperinsulinemia, they were 35% higher in the hiimcl group than the loimcl group (p < 0.01). study of insulin signaling indicated that insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (ir) was blunted in hiimcl compared with loimcl (57 vs. 142% above basal, p < 0.05), while protein expression of the ir was unaltered. ir substrate-1-associated phosphatidylinositol (pi) 3-kinase activation by insulin was also lower in the hiimcl group than in the loimcl group (49 +/- 23 vs. 84 +/- 27% above basal, p < 0.05 between hiimcl and loimcl). in conclusion, imcl accumulation is associated with whole-body insulin resistance and with defective insulin signaling in skeletal muscle independent of body weight and physical fitness.
increased fusiform area activation in schizophrenia during processing of spatial frequency-degraded faces, as revealed by fmri. pathways within the visual system can be distinguished on the basis of selectivity for low or high spatial frequencies. spatial frequency discrimination was evaluated in 17 medicated male patients with schizophrenia and 19 male control subjects. subjects were required to discriminate whether pairs of high contrast, sinusoidally modulated gratings were the same or different in spatial frequency. accuracy performance was compared at high, medium, and low spatial frequencies on tasks matched for control performance. patients showed a greater performance decrement of 12% on low as compared with 4% on high spatial frequencies. these findings suggest a disturbance of right hemisphere mechanisms involved in spatial perception and attention in schizophrenia.
menopause occurs late in life in the captive chimpanzee (pan troglodytes) changes in the endocrinology of the pituitary-ovarian axis first become manifest at about the age of 40, a selective rise in serum follicle stimulating hormone (fsh) levels occurring at about the same time as a marked acceleration in the loss of primordial follicles from the ovary. fsh levels gradually increase with increasing age in women who continue to cycle regularly. during the menopausal transition, initiated when changes in cycle frequency or in menstrual flow are first observed, both gonadotrophins, oestradiol and inhibin show a marked degree of variability with abrupt changes from typical post-menopausal patterns to those characteristic of the reproductive age group. within 1-2 years after the final menstrual period or menopause, fsh levels are markedly elevated, luteinizing hormone (lh) levels moderately so, while oestradiol and inhibin levels are low or undetectable. post-menopausally, adrenal androstenedione is the major source of oestrogen and serum testosterone levels fall moderately, with oophorectomy leading to a further significant fall. serum sex hormone binding globulin levels fall to a small degree post-menopausally. areas of persisting controversy include the question of whether oestradiol levels fall with increasing age prior to the onset of the menopausal transition, the relative roles of oestradiol and inhibin in the selective rise of serum fsh and the role of serum androgens post-menopausally.
diagnostic tools for assessment of urinary dysfunction in ms patients without urinary disturbances objective to review current management of neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (nlutd) in ms patients and give recommendations on the joint role of the neurologist and urologist in nlutd management.   methods an algorithm for evaluation and referral of ms patients to urologists was created. it is an outcome of discussions about current knowledge, existing guidelines, and key issues during two belgian consensus meetings attended by neurologists, urologists and other stakeholders involved in ms management. at these meetings, updated information on management of nlutd in ms was exchanged and the neurologists' opinion on how to integrate this in the other aspects of care in ms patients was explored.   results short evaluation of nlutd in ms patients by neurologists and appropriate referral to urologists could accelerate proper diagnosis and treatment. neurologists can play a central role in the inter-disciplinary communication on interactions between disease manifestations of ms and their treatments.   conclusion the coordinating role of neurologists in nlutd management may considerably improve qol in ms patients. more research is needed to evaluate outcomes of urological assessments and treatment.
effect of triadimefon: a triazole fungicide on oxidative stress defense system and eugenol content in ocimum tenuiflorum l. more than 300 catalase sequences are now available, divided among monofunctional catalases (> 225), bifunctional catalase-peroxidases (> 50) and manganese-containing catalases (> 25). when combined with the recent appearance of crystal structures from at least two representatives from each of these groups (nine from the monofunctional catalases), valuable insights into the catalatic reaction mechanism in its various forms and into catalase evolution have been gained. the structures have revealed an unusually large number of modifications unique to catalases, a result of interacting with reactive oxygen species. biochemical and physiological characterization of catalases from many different organisms has revealed a surprisingly wide range of catalatic efficiencies, despite similar sequences. catalase gene expression in micro-organisms generally is controlled either by sensors of reactive oxygen species or by growth phase regulons, although the detailed mechanisms vary considerably.
hemangiopericytoma-associated hypoglycemia improved by glucocorticoid therapy: a case report serum insulin-like growth factor ii (igf-ii) was characterized by radioimmunoassay and western immunoblot in 44 patients with non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia (nicth). 31 of 44 patients with nicth had big igf-ii in sera. when the presence of igf-ii in tumors from 20 patients was investigated, igf-ii in tumors was detected in 18 patients and these patients had big igf-ii in sera. in two patients whose tumors did not contain igf-ii, big igf-ii in sera was not detected. in six patients with igf-ii in tumors, hypoglycemia disappeared and the big igf-ii decreased after successful removal of the tumors. these data indicate that the big igf-ii could be related to hypoglycemia, and that the increased serum big igf-ii suggests igf-ii-producing nicth. serum igf-ii levels in 31 patients with big igf-ii were greater than those in 13 patients without it (mean +/- sem: 723+/-54 vs. 326+/-31 ng/ml), but the elevated igf-ii levels were found in only 13 patients. serum igf-i levels were low in all patients with nicth. in the 13 patients without big igf-ii, serum igf-ii levels were lower than those in the patients with big igf-ii, and serum igf-i levels were also low. serum igf-ii/igf-i ratios in the patients with big igf-ii were elevated and greater than those in the patients without big igf-ii (35.0+/-2.2 vs. 11.5+/-2.4). the present data indicate that igf-ii-producing tumors are not rare in nicth, and serum big igf-ii and igf-ii/igf-i ratio are useful for screening patients with igf-ii-producing nicth.
contemporary management of traumatic intracranial hypertension: is there a role for therapeutic hypothermia? background infectious complications are among the most serious problems that occur in severely head-injured patients treated with mild hypothermia. the mechanism underlying the susceptibility to infection has not been clarified. heat shock protein (hsp) 60 has been reported to play an essential role in innate immunity. thus, we conducted a study to clarify the impact of mild hypothermia on the expression of hsps in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmnls) in severely head-injured patients.   methods between september 1997 and november 1999, 17 severely head-injured patients with a glasgow coma scale score of 8 or less at admission in whom intracranial pressure could be maintained below 20 mm hg by conventional therapy were randomly assigned to two treatment groups: a mild hypothermia group (ht group, nine patients) and a normothermia group (nt group, eight patients). the ht group was subjected to mild hypothermia (intracranial temperature, 34 degrees c) for 48 hours followed by rewarming at a rate of 1 degrees c per day for 3 days, whereas the nt group was subjected to normothermia (intracranial temperature, 37 degrees c) for 5 days. blood samples were serially obtained at three time points; days 0 to 1, days 2 to 5, and days 6 to 14 after head injury. we measured the expression of hsp27, hsp60, hsp70, and hsp90 by flow cytometry.   results the two groups were similar with respect to prognostic factors, and there was no difference in clinical outcome. the expression of pmnl hsp60 in the ht group was significantly lower in all three time periods compared with that in the nt group (p < 0.05), whereas expression of the other hsps did not differ significantly between the groups. the incidence of infectious complications was significantly increased in the ht group over that in the nt group (p < 0.05). in in vitro studies, pmnls from 10 healthy volunteers were incubated at 37 degrees c, 34 degrees c, or 26 degrees c for 1 hour with sodium arsenite (100 micromol/l), an hsp inducer. the expression of hsp60 at 26 degrees c and 34 degrees c was significantly lower than that at 37 degrees c (p < 0.05), whereas expression of the other hsps did not differ significantly at 26 degrees c, 34 degrees c, or 37 degrees c.   conclusion mild hypothermia reduces the expression of hsp60 in pmnls from severely head-injured patients. thus, mild hypothermia may suppress innate immunity.
is there a solution to publication bias? researchers call for changes in dissemination of clinical research results. aims to identify trends in the demographic and smoking characteristics of new callers to the new zealand quitline, a national free-phone smoking cessation service, between 2001 and 2005. methods demographic and smoking behaviour of quitline callers were routinely collected by quit advisors over the phone. characteristics of new callers were extracted from the client database, and compared across 5 years to determine changes over time. results statistically significant differences were found in all variables (except for gender) across the 5-year period. the results show an increased proportion of callers are under 25 years old (67% increase), started smoking at 15 years old or older (10% increase), and/or have smoked for less than 10 years (86% increase). there is also an increased proportion of callers smoking roll-your-own cigarettes (13% increase). in terms of ethnicity, the proportion of pacific people using the quitline increased by 54%, while the proportion of māori callers fluctuated at just above 20% of all new callers. the proportion of pregnant callers also increased over time (127% increase) although the overall percent remains small. conclusions the results indicate notable changes in the characteristics of new quitline callers between 2001 and 2005. such information will be of benefit to the future design of quitline marketing and adapting service provision to best meet the needs of callers. new zealand’s national free-phone quitline was established in 1999. since then, no analysis has been conducted to identify trends in characteristics of callers over time. similar research appears to be lacking in other countries, where researchers have built profiles using accumulated statistics without addressing changes over time. this study therefore aimed to explore this aspect by analysing the demographic and smoking characteristics of new callers registering with the new zealand quitline during the 5 years from 2001 to 2005. in november 2000, the new zealand quitline became a world-first by providing heavily subsidised nicotine replacement therapy (nrt) in the form of patches and gum as an adjunct to its telephone smoking cessation service. prior to the introduction of nrt, quitline callers received information and practical strategies for quitting, along with proactive follow-up calls from a quit advisor for quit support and advice. with the new service, callers are eligible to receive nrt when certain conditions are met (such as a satisfactory medical history and a commitment to quit). the availability of heavily subsidised nrt (a 92% reduction in the over-the-counter price) was well received by the smoking population, evidenced in the sharp increase of callers that was sustained for several years. this was similar to a more recent experience in minnesota, usa where the quitline offering free patches and gum to callers.
multikinase inhibitor sorafenib prevents pressure overload-induced left ventricular hypertrophy in rats by blocking the c-raf/erk1/2 signaling pathway the natriuretic peptides (nps) are a group of peptide hormones that play important roles in the control of renal, cardiovascular, endocrine, and skeletal homeostasis. atrial np (anp) was first identified as an activity by de bold et al1 in 1981. it is a 28 amino acid peptide in humans that assumes a hairpin structure by virtue of a cystine bridge that links residues 7 and 23 (figure 1). brain np (bnp), also known as the b-type np, is 32 amino acids long in the human. it has a similar hairpin structure but demonstrates considerably more heterogeneity across species than anp. c-type np (cnp) is a 22 amino acid peptide that has a truncated carboxy terminus beyond the second cystine residue in the bridge.     figure 1. primary structure of human nps.    anp and bnp are produced primarily within the muscle cells of the heart. anp shows a preference for expression in the cardiac atria versus ventricle, whereas bnp is more equivalently expressed throughout the heart. anp is also expressed in the hypothalamus where it is thought to control blood pressure (bp), sympathetic outflow, vasopressin secretion, drinking behavior, and cardiovascular homeostasis. bnp, on the other hand, is expressed in the brains of only a few species (eg, pig and dog), where its function remains unknown. cnp is expressed in the central nervous system, reproductive tract, bone, and endothelium of blood vessels.  there are 3 different types of np receptors, and each of them spans the membrane bilayer as a single transmembrane segment. the type a np receptor (npr-a) is also known as the particulate guanylyl cyclase a. it is the high affinity receptor for both anp and bnp. a schematic of the structure of this receptor is presented in figure 2. npr-a has a glycosylated, extracellular, ligand-binding domain linked to …
heat-activated sustaining nitric oxide release from zwitterionic diazeniumdiolate loaded in thermo-sensitive liposomes. selected nucleophile/nitric oxide adducts [compounds which contain the anionic moiety, xn(o-)n = o] were studied for their ability to release nitric oxide spontaneously in aqueous solution and for possible vasoactivity. the diversity of structures chosen included those in which the nucleophile residue, x, was that of a secondary amine [et2n, as in [et2nn(n = o)o]na, 1], a primary amine [iprhn, as in [iprhnn(n = o)o]na, 2], a polyamine, spermine [as in the zwitterion h2n(ch2)3nh2+(ch2)4n[n(n = o)o-](ch2)3nh2, 3], oxide [as in na[on(n = o)o]na, 4], and sulfite [as in nh4[o3sn(n = o)o]nh4, 5]. the rate constants (k) for decomposition in ph 7.4 phosphate buffer at 37 degrees c, as measured by following loss of chromophore at 230-260 nm, were as follows: 1, 5.4 x 10(-3) s-1; 2, 5.1 x 10(-3) s-1; 3, 0.30 x 10(-3) s-1; 4, 5.0 x 10(-3) s-1; and 5, 1.7 x 10(-3) s-1. the corresponding extents of nitric oxide release (eno) were 1.5, 0.73, 1.9, 0.54, and 0.001 mol/mol of starting material consumed, respectively, as determined from the integrated chemiluminescence response. vasodilatory activities expressed as the concentrations required to induce 50% relaxation in norepinephrine-constricted aortic rings bathed in ph 7.4 buffer at 37 degrees c (ec50) were as follows: 1, 0.19 microm; 2, 0.45 microm; 3, 6.2 microm; 4, 0.59 microm; and 5, 62 microm. vasorelaxant potency (expressed as 1/ec50) was strongly correlated with the quantity of .no calculated from the physicochemical data to be released in the interval required to achieve maximum relaxation at the ec50 doses (r = 0.995). this suggests that such nucleophile/.no adducts might generally be useful as vehicles for the nonenzymatic generation of nitric oxide, in predictable amounts and at predictable rates, for biological purposes. the particular significance for possible drug design is underscored in the very favorable potency comparison between several of these agents and the established nitrovasodilators sodium nitroprusside and glyceryl trinitrate (ec50 values of 2.0 and greater than 10 microm, respectively) in parallel aortic ring tests.
late rectal toxicity determined by dose–volume parameters in computed tomography‐based brachytherapy for locally advanced cervical cancer background and aim we aimed to quantify target volume delineation uncertainties in cervix cancer image guided adaptive brachytherapy (igabt).   materials and methods ten radiation oncologists delineated gross tumour volume (gtv), high- and intermediate-risk clinical target volume (hr ctv, ir ctv) in six patients. their contours were compared with two reference delineations (staple-simultaneous truth and performance level estimation and ec- expert consensus) by calculating volumetric and planar conformity index (vci and pci) and inter-delineation distances (idd).   results vcistaple and vciec were 0.76 and 0.72 for hr ctv, 0.77 and 0.68 for ir ctv and 0.59 and 0.58 for gtv. variation was most prominent caudally and cranially in all target volumes and posterolaterally in ir ctv. iddstaple and iddec for hr ctv (3.6±3.5 and 3.8±3.4 mm) were significantly lower than for gtv (4.8±4.2 and 4.2±3.5 mm) and ir ctv (4.7±5.2 and 5.2±5.6 mm) (p<0.05).   conclusions due to lower delineation uncertainties when compared to gtv and ir ctv, hr ctv may be considered most robust volume for dose prescription and optimization in cervix cancer igabt. adequate imaging, training and use of contouring recommendations are main strategies to minimize delineation uncertainties.
visual tracking via subspace learning: a discriminative approach in this paper, we propose a generative tracking method based on a novel robust linear regression algorithm. in contrast to existing methods, the proposed least soft-thresold squares (lss) algorithm models the error term with the gaussian-laplacian distribution, which can be solved efficiently. based on maximum joint likelihood of parameters, we derive a lss distance to measure the difference between an observation sample and the dictionary. compared with the distance derived from ordinary least squares methods, the proposed metric is more effective in dealing with outliers. in addition, we present an update scheme to capture the appearance change of the tracked target and ensure that the model is properly updated. experimental results on several challenging image sequences demonstrate that the proposed tracker achieves more favorable performance than the state-of-the-art methods.
comparison of enteral nutrition with combined enteral and parenteral nutrition in post-pancreaticoduodenectomy patients: a pilot study patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy (pd) often require postoperative artificial nutrition. this trial was undertaken to evaluate whether the route of administration and the composition of the postoperative nutritional support could affect the immunometabolic response and outcome. a prospective, randomized trial was carried out in 212 subjects who underwent pd. patients were randomized to receive a standard enteral formula (standard group, n = 73) or an enteral formula enriched with arginine, omega-3 fatty acids, and rna (immunonutrition group, n = 71), or total parenteral nutrition (parenteral group, n = 68). postoperative feeding started 6 hours after surgery. the three regimens were isocaloric and isonitrogenous. assessed parameters were phagocytosis ability of polymorphonuclear cells, plasma interleukin-2 receptors, c-reactive protein, retinol binding protein, tolerance of enteral feeding, rate of postoperative complications, and length of hospital stay (los). full nutritional goal (25 kcal/kg) was achieved in 87% of enterally fed patients versus 95% in the parenteral group. subjects receiving immunonutrition had a significantly better recovery of the immunometabolic parameters on postoperative day 8 compared to the other two groups. the rate of postoperative complications was lower in the immunonutrition group (33.8%) than in either the standard (43.8%) or parenteral group (58.8%) (p = 0.005 immunonutrition vs. parenteral). also, the mean los was shorter in the immunonutrition group than in the standard and parenteral groups (15.1 vs. 17.0 vs. 18.8 days, respectively;p < 0.05). early postoperative enteral feeding may safely and effectively replace parenteral nutrition in patients undergoing pd. immunonutrition ameliorates the immunometabolic response and improves outcome compared to parenteral feeding.
tertiary dentinogenesis with calcium hydroxide: a review of proposed mechanisms. lipopolysaccharide (lps), a cell wall component of gram negative anaerobic bacteria, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of periapical disease resulting from infected root canals. calcium hydroxide [ca(oh)2] has been shown to be an effective medicament in such infections, reducing the microbial titre within the canal. it has been proposed that the therapeutic effect of ca(oh)2 may also be the result of direct inactivation of lps. the aim of this study was to investigate whether the toxic potential of an escherichia coli lps could be reduced or eliminated by ca(oh)2. four concentrations of e. coli lps ranging from 1-1000 ng/ml sterile water were incubated in duplicate either with 25 mg ca(oh)2 or sterile water alone. controls consisted of ca(oh)2 without lps or sterile water only. monocytes were collected from peripheral blood by centrifuging through a gradient and plated to a specific density. adherent monocytes were incubated for 4 days at 37 degrees c with 5% co2 in m199 medium with 10% autologous serum. the different lps solutions were added to the wells on day 5. after 4 h the supernatants were collected and quantitatively assayed for tnf-alpha using a commercial elisa kit. statistical analysis was performed with anova. results indicated that ca(oh)2 is able to eliminate the ability of an e. coli lps to stimulate tnf-alpha production in peripheral blood monocytes (p < 0.0001).
phenotypic characterization of leishmania spp. causing cutaneous leishmaniasis in the lower amazon region, western pará state, brazil, reveals a putative hybrid parasite, leishmania (viannia) guyanensis × leishmania (viannia) shawi shawi this paper is a review of the major historical events leading to our present classification of the neotropical leishmania species, and apart from indicating the basic type of disease these different parasites may cause in humans, it does not discuss the clinical or epidemiological features of the leishmaniases. for each of these species, information is given on the known geographical distribution, recorded phlebotomine sand fly host(s) and the secondary, wild or domestic mammalian hosts. reasons are given for regarding the parasite referred to as leishmania (l.) infantum chagasi, the causative agent of american visceral leishmaniasis, as most probably indigenous to the neotropics rather than imported during the iberian colonisation.
linking root morphology, longevity and function to root branch order: a case study in three shrubs we used minirhizotrons to determine patterns of root longevity andturnover for the perennial bunchgrass bouteloua gracilisinthe shortgrass steppe of eastern colorado, usa. we hypothesized that rootlongevity would be partially controlled by root diameter, following previouslyobserved patterns in woody plants. in addition, we hypothesized that rootturnover would be greatest in surface soil horizons and decrease with depth dueto variation in soil moisture availability and temperature. root longevity wascorrelated with root diameter. median life span of roots > 0.4mm was approximately 320 days, while roots < 0.2mmhad a median life span of 180 days. there was approximately a 6%decreasein the likelihood of mortality with a 0.10-mm increase inroot diameter, controlling for the effect of depth in the soil profile. rootlength production and mortality were highest in the upper20 cm of the soil profile and decreased with depth.however,because root length density also decreased with depth, there were nosignificantdifferences in turnover rate of root length among sampling intervals. turnoverwas approximately 0.86 yr−1 based on root length production,while turnover was 0.35 yr−1 using root length mortality as ameasurement of flux. the imbalance between turnover estimates may be aconsequence of the time the minirhizotrons were in place prior to imaging or mayresult from our lack of over-winter measures of mortality. our worksuggests that bouteloua gracilis roots have complex lifehistory strategies, similar to woody species. some portion of the root systemishighly ephemeral, while slightly larger roots persist much longer. thesedifferences have implications for belowground carbon and nitrogen cycles in theshortgrass steppe.
energy-efficient oxide-confined 850-nm vcsels for long-distance multimode fiber optical interconnects we present extremely energy-efficient oxide-confined 850-nm single-mode vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (vcsels) for optical interconnects. error-free transmission at 17 gb/s across 1 km of multimode optical fiber is achieved with an ultra-low energy-to-data ratio of 99 fj/bit, corresponding to a record-low energy-to-data-distance ratio of 99 fj/(bit ·km). this performance is achieved without changing any of the driving parameters up to 55 °c. to date our vcsels are the most energy-efficient directly modulated light-sources for data transmission across all distances up to 1 km of multimode optical fiber.
mammalian frataxin: an essential function for cellular viability through an interaction with a preformed iscu/nfs1/isd11 iron-sulfur assembly complex frataxin is an essential mitochondrial protein whose reduced expression causes friedreich's ataxia (frda), a lethal neurodegenerative disease. it is believed that frataxin is an iron chaperone that participates in iron metabolism. we have tested this hypothesis using the bacterial frataxin ortholog, cyay, and different biochemical and biophysical techniques. we observe that cyay participates in iron-sulfur (fe-s) cluster assembly as an iron-dependent inhibitor of cluster formation, through binding to the desulfurase iscs. the interaction with iscs involves the iron binding surface of cyay, which is conserved throughout the frataxin family. we propose that frataxins are iron sensors that act as regulators of fe-s cluster formation to fine-tune the quantity of fe-s cluster formed to the concentration of the available acceptors. our observations provide new perspectives for understanding frda and a mechanistic model that rationalizes the available knowledge on frataxin.
nonlinear relationship of near-bed velocity and growth of riverbed periphyton current velocity is a pervasive feature of lotic systems, yet this defining environmental variable is rarely examined as a factor for regulating stream herbivory. to investigate how current modifies herbivory in the upper colorado river, u.s.a., loops of electrified fencing wire were used to reduce in situ grazer densities on 30 × 30 cm tile substrates. after 45 d, electrified tiles had significantly fewer grazers (p = 0.03) and >2x more algal biomass than controls (p = 0.0002). reduced grazing on electrified tiles yielded periphytic assemblages having more diatoms and chlorophytes, as well as greater algal species richness. current velocity effects alone did not significantly regulate algal abundance; however, the interaction between current velocity and grazer exclusion resulted in more algae in slow vs. fast current (p = 0.02). grazer abundances were similar between fast and slow current velocities, suggesting that grazers in the colorado river differ in their ability to regulate algae across the current velocity gradient. our results indicate that stream current-mediated herbivory in streams may be more important than is generally recognized.
mapping c-terminal transactivation domains of the nuclear her family receptor tyrosine kinase her3 purpose: the epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) inhibitor gefitinib (iressa) has shown antitumor activity in clinical trials against cancers, such as non–small cell lung cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc). research on non–small cell lung cancer has elucidated factors that may predict response to gefitinib. less is known about molecular markers that may predict response to gefitinib in hnscc patients. experimental design: we analyzed possible associations of responsiveness to gefitinib with molecular markers of the egfr/erbb receptor family signaling pathway using 10 established hnscc lines in vitro. ic50 of gefitinib sensitivity was determined using clonogenic survival assays. erbb signaling was assessed by western and real-time reverse transcription-pcr analyses of egfr, erbb2, erbb3, and erbb4 expression levels as well as by phosphorylation analysis of pegfr, perbb2, perbb3, pakt, and perk. egfr sequences encoding kinase domain and egfr gene copy numbers were determined by cdna sequencing and real-time pcr, respectively. finally, responsiveness to gefitinib was compared with responsiveness to the anti-egfr antibody cetuximab (erbitux). results: expression levels of perbb2 (p = 0.02) and total erbb3 protein (p = 0.02) associated with resistance to gefitinib. combining gefitinib with pertuzumab (omnitarg), an antibody targeting erbb2 heterodimerization, provided additional growth-inhibitory effect over gefitinib alone on relatively gefitinib-resistant hnscc cell lines. the same markers did not predict resistance to cetuximab. in contrast, a similar trend suggesting association between egfr gene copy number and drug sensitivity was observed for both gefitinib (p = 0.0498) and cetuximab (p = 0.053). no activating egfr mutations were identified. conclusions:egfr amplification may predict sensitivity to gefitinib in hnscc. however, other egfr/erbb receptor family members than egfr may contribute to resistance to gefitinib. erbb2 and erbb3 may have potential as predictive markers and as therapeutic targets for combination therapy in treatment of hnscc with gefitinib.
association of the mir-196a2, mir-146a, and mir-499 polymorphisms with asthma phenotypes in a korean population to identify proteins that might play an important role in allergen‐induced asthma, we analyzed lung extracts prepared from allergen (ovalbumin)‐challenged animals in a mouse model of this condition. the combination of two‐dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry revealed that annexin‐1, a 37 kda anti‐inflammatory protein that inhibits the activity of cytosolic phospholipase a2 (cpla2), was down‐regulated by allergen challenge in the lungs of ovalbumin‐sensitized mice. immunoblot analysis showed that this effect of ovalbumin challenge was attributable to proteolytic cleavage of annexin‐1. the ovalbumin‐induced degradation of annexin‐1 was blocked by pretreatment of mice with the antioxidant n‐acetylcysteine (nac) or with sodium selenite, both of which have previously been shown to exert anti‐inflammatory effects in this asthma model. ovalbumin challenge also both increased the expression of cpla2 in lung tissue and reduced the extent of the interaction between cpla2 and annexin‐1, and these effects were inhibited by nac or selenite. moreover, the concentrations of cysteinyl leukotrienes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and of leukotriene b4 in lung tissue were increased by ovalbumin challenge in a nac‐ or selenite‐sensitive manner. together, these results suggest that allergen‐induced oxidative stress results in proteolysis of annexin‐1 and consequent up‐regulation of cpla2 activity and leukotriene production in this mouse model of asthma, and that the anti‐inflammatory effects of selenite may provide a basis for the development of new antiasthmatic drugs.
identification and chronological analysis of genomic signatures in influenza a viruses influenza a viruses may cross species barriers and transmit to humans with the potential to cause pandemics. interplay of human- (pb2 627k) and avian-like (pb2 627e) influenza polymerase complexes with unknown host factors have been postulated to play a key role in interspecies transmission. here, we have identified human importin-α isoforms (α1 and α7) as positive regulators of human- but not avian-like polymerase activity. human-like polymerase activity correlated with efficient recruitment of α1 and α7 to viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vrnps) without affecting subcellular localization. we also observed that human-like influenza virus growth was impaired in α1 and α7 downregulated human lung cells. mice lacking α7 were less susceptible to human- but not avian-like influenza virus infection. thus, α1 and α7 are positive regulators of human-like polymerase activity and pathogenicity beyond their role in nuclear transport.
enriched transcription factor signatures in triple negative breast cancer indicates possible targeted therapies with existing drugs we have identified and cloned a novel member of the nuclear receptor superfamily from murine testis, referred to as retinoid receptor-related testis-associated receptor or rtr. degenerate pcr primers homologous to two conserved regions of the dna-binding domain of members of this superfamily were employed to identify this gene. the amino-acid sequence of rtr is most closely related to that of the mouse rxrs with an overall identity of 32-34%; the highest similarity (61%) is observed in the dna-binding domain. northern blot analysis using rna from multiple tissues showed that rtr is predominantly expressed in the testis. northern blot analysis using rna from different testicular cell types showed that rtr mrna is not expressed in early germ cells or sertoli cells but is most abundant in round spermatids. our observations suggest that this putative transcription factor plays a role in the regulation of gene expression particularly during the post-meiotic phase of spermatogenesis.
de novo transcriptome of the hemimetabolous german cockroach (blattella germanica) insect os-d-like proteins, also known as chemosensory (csp) or sensory appendage proteins (sap), are broadly expressed in various insect tissues, where they are thought to bind short to medium chain length fatty acids and their derivatives. although their specific function remains uncertain, os-d-like members have been isolated from sensory organs (including the sensillum lymph in some cases), and a role in olfaction similar to that of the insect odorant binding proteins (obp) has been suggested for some. we have identified 15 new os-d-like sequences: four from cdna clones described herein and 11 from sequence databases. the os-d-like genes from the anopheles gambiae, apis mellifera, drosophila melanogaster, and drosophila pseudoobscura genomes typically have single, small introns with a conserved splice site. together with all family members entered on genbank, a total of 70 os-d-like proteins, representing the insect orders diptera, dictyoptera, hymenoptera, lepidoptera, orthoptera, and phasmatodea, were analyzed. a neighbor joining distance phenogram identified several protein similarity classes that were characterized by highly conserved sequence motifs, including (a) n-terminal yttkydn(v/i)(n/d)(l/v)deil, (b) central dgkelkxx(i/l)pdal, and (c) c-terminal kydp. in contrast, three similarity classes were characterized by their diversion from these conserved motifs. the functional importance of conserved amino acid residues is discussed in relation to the crystal and nmr structures of mbracspa6.
comparison of the effect of the trendelenburg and passive leg raising positions on internal jugular vein size in critically ill patients. background the trendelenburg position is used to distend the central veins, improving both the success and safety of vascular cannulation. the purpose of this study was to measure the cross-sectional area (csa) of the internal jugular vein (ijv) in three different positions using surface ultrasonography.   methods fifty-one subjects were enrolled. a sono site titan 180 or m-turbo portable ultrasound machine with a 10.5-mhz broadband linear surface probe was used. we measured the csa of the ijv (at end-expiration at the level of the cricoid cartilage) in three positions: 15° reverse trendelenburg, supine, and 15° trendelenburg.   results the mean csa at 15° reverse trendelenburg was 0.83 cm2 (sd, 0.86), in the supine position it was 1.25 cm2 (sd, 0.98), and at -15° trendelenburg it was 1.47 cm2 (sd, 1.03). moving from reverse trendelenburg to supine, the csa increased by 50%. in contrast, lowering the head to a trendelenburg position increased the mean csa by only 17%. surprisingly, trendelenburg positioning reduced the csa in nine of the 51 subjects.   conclusions trendelenburg positioning augments the csa only modestly, on average, compared with the supine position, and in some patients it reduces the csa.   trial registration clinicaltrials.gov; no.: nct01099254; url: www.clinicaltrials.gov.
towards a new isolation abstraction for osgi to date, systems offering multitasking for the javatm programming language either use one process or one class loader for each application. both approaches are unsatisfactory. using operating system processes is expensive, scales poorly and does not fully exploit the protection features inherent in a safe language. class loaders replicate application code, obscure the type system, and non-uniformly treat ‘trusted’ and ‘untrusted’ classes, which leads to subtle, but nevertheless, potentially harmful forms of undesirable inter-application interaction. in this paper we propose a novel, simple yet powerful solution. the new model improves on existing designs in terms of resource utilization while offering strong isolation among applications. the approach is applicable both on high-end servers and on small devices. the main idea is to maintain only one copy of every class, regardless of how many applications use it. classes are transparently and automatically modified, so that each application has a separate copy of its static fields. two prototypes are described and selected performance data is analyzed. various aspects of the proposed architectural changes to the java virtual machine are discussed.
this information is current as complement receptor cr 1 require expression of the mouse and t-dependent antibody responses optimal germinal center b cell activation affinity maturation of the humoral immune response by somatic hypermutation is marked by a rapid and dramatic increase in affinity for the eliciting antigen. we suggest that the optimal mutation schedule is one in which periods of rapid mutation alternate with periods of mutation-free growth. the multicompartmental structure of the germinal center, together with re-entry of positively selected b cells back into the germinal center, will naturally implement such a schedule, thereby providing an anatomical basis for the efficiency of the germinal center reaction.
development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eae) in mice requires vitamin d and the vitamin d receptor a protective association between higher vitamin d levels and the onset of multiple sclerosis (ms) has been demonstrated; however, its role in modulating ms clinical course has been little studied. we investigated whether higher levels of serum 25‐hydroxyvitamin d (25‐oh‐d) were associated with a lower risk of relapses in people with ms.
lower incidence of hypo-magnesemia in surgical intensive care unit patients in 2011 versus 2001 magnesium deficiency and hypomagnesemia remain quite prevalent, particularly in patients in intensive care units, and may have important clinical consequences. magnesium should be measured directly in clinical circumstances in which a risk for magnesium deficiency exists and appropriately corrected when found. this commentary reviews the current knowledge of magnesium homeostasis and the risk factors and clinical consequences of magnesium deficiency and outlines approaches to therapy.
a stochastic mathematical model of the within-herd transmission dynamics of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv): fade-out and persistence. the aim of this study was to determine whether porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv) could be transmitted by aerosol under field conditions. a total of 210 five-month-old prrsv-negative pigs were housed in a mechanically ventilated finishing facility containing 11 pens. pen 1 contained 10 pigs (indirect contact controls) and pen 2 remained empty, providing a barrier of 2.5 m from the remaining pigs in pens 3 to 11. fifteen or 16 of the pigs in each of pens 3 to 11 were infected experimentally with a field isolate of prrsv and the other six or seven pigs served as direct contact controls. five days after the pigs were infected, two trailers containing 10 five-week-old prrsv-naive sentinel pigs were placed along each side of the building; one was placed 1 m from the exhaust fans on one side of the building, and the other was placed 30 m from the fans on the other side, and the sentinel pigs remained in the trailers for 72 hours. they were then moved to separate buildings on the same site, 30 and 80 m, respectively, from the infected barn, and their prrsv status was monitored for 21 days. the direct and indirect contact control pigs became infected with prrsv but the sentinel pigs did not.
differential effect of methyl‐, butyl‐ and propylparaben and 17β‐estradiol on selected cell cycle and apoptosis gene and protein expression in mcf‐7 breast cancer cells and mcf‐10a non‐malignant cells backgroundwidely accepted somatic mutation theory of carcinogenesis states that mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in genomes of somatic cells is the cause of neoplastic transformation. identifying frequent mutations in cancer cells suggests the involvement of mutant genes in carcinogenesis.resultsto develop an in vitro model for the analysis of genetic alterations associated with breast carcinogenesis, we used random mutagenesis and selection of human non-tumorigenic immortalized breast epithelial cells mcf-10a in tissue-culture conditions that mimic tumor environment. random mutations were generated in mcf-10a cells by cultivating them in a tissue-culture medium containing the frameshift-inducing agent icr191. the first selective condition we used to transform mcf1-10a cells was cultivation in a medium containing mutagen at a concentration that allowed cell replication despite p53 protein accumulation induced by mutagen treatment. the second step of selection was either cell cultivation in a medium with reduced growth-factor supply or in a medium that mimics a hypoxia condition or growing in soft agar. using mutagenesis and selection, we have generated several independently derived cultures with various degrees of transformation. gene identification by nonsense-mediated mrna decay inhibition (gini) analysis has identified the icr191-induced frameshift mutations in the tp53, smoothelin, ras association (ralgds/af-6) domain family 6 (rassf6) and other genes in the transformed mcf-10a cells. the tp53 gene mutations resulting in the loss of protein expression had been found in all independently transformed mcf-10a cultures, which form large progressively growing tumors with sustained angiogenesis in nude mice.conclusionidentifying genes containing bi-allelic icr191-induced frameshift mutations in the transformed mcf-10a cells generated by random mutagenesis and selection indicates putative breast-tumor suppressors. this can provide a model for studying the role of mutant genes in breast carcinogenesis.
comparison of 4 direct coombs' test methods with polyclonal antiglobulins in anemic and nonanemic dogs for in‐clinic or laboratory use the coombs' test can detect both immunoglobulin and complement on the surface of rbcs, and as such can be of value as an aid in the diagnosis of imha. techniques that may improve sensitivity include use of monovalent reagents, increased dilutions of antiglobulin to avoid a prozone effect, and testing at 4°c. these techniques are not without controversy, and positive tests should always be interpreted in the presence of other clinical and hematologic evidence for imha. alternate techniques, such as flow cytometry, can improve detection of rbc-bound immunoglobulin, but require a flow cytometer and further standardization between laboratories.
isozyme-specific ligands for o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase, a novel antibiotic target abstract the bifunctional protein complex, cysteine synthetase, in salmonella typhimurium is composed of the enzymes serine transacetylase and o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase. a point mutation (bb1) in the structural gene for serine transacetylase results in diminished catalytic activity of both components of the complex. enzyme inactivation studies using either specific o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase antiserum or heat show that the isolated o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase components of the mutant are indistinguishable from wild type o-acetyl-serine sulfhydrylase. when o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase from either wild type or mutant source is combined with serine transacetylase from a common source, their behavior is identical as measured by decrement in enzymic activity, immunological inactivation, and heat inactivation. thus, when hybrid cysteine synthetases, composed of one component from the wild type and one from the mutant, are investigated, the o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase components of such hybrid complexes behave like those found in the native cysteine synthetase from which the serine transacetylase component was derived. these studies establish that the diminished catalytic activity of the sulfhydrylase of the mutant results from the association of catalytically normal o-acetyl-serine sulfhydrylase with mutant serine transacetylase. the basis of the pleiotropic phenotype of mutant bb1 is, therefore, an alteration in protein-protein interaction resulting from a structural gene mutation.
cognitive predictors of treatment response to bupropion and cognitive effects of bupropion in patients with major depressive disorder this was a 4-week, three-center, double-blind, randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled evaluation of the efficacy and safety of bupropion in hospitalized depressed patients. results from 27 placebo and 48 bupropion-treated patients were analyzed for efficacy and safety. assessments of efficacy and safety were made at baseline and weekly during the study. primary and secondary measures of efficacy included the clinical global impressions for severity (cgi-s) and improvement (cgi-i) of illness, hamilton depression and hamilton anxiety scales, and the zung self-rating scales for depression and anxiety. assessments of safety included vital signs, electrocardiogram, clinical laboratory tests, and adverse experiences. dosages of bupropion were 300–600 mg/day. results showed that bupropion was significantly (p<0.01) more effective than placebo at termination of study on the cgi-s, cgi-i, hamilton depression and hamilton anxiety scales. on the zung self-rating depression and anxiety scales, statistical trends favored bupropion at termination of study over placebo (p<0.10). adverse events in the bupropion and placebo groups were minimal with notable absence of sedation and anticholinergic-and cardiovascular-related side effects. we conclude that bupropion was significantly more effective than placebo in treating depression and accompanying anxiety in depressed inpatients.
high cd10 expression predicts favorable outcome in surgically treated lymph node-positive bladder cancer patients. we tested 505 cases of nonhematopoietic neoplasms by immunohistochemistry using a newly characterized monoclonal antibody (clone 56c6) against the cd10 antigen. cd10 was expressed widely in neoplasms of the genitourinary tract, including 41 (89%) of 46 cases of renal cell carcinoma, 13 (54%) of 24 cases of transitional cell carcinoma, and 11 (61%) of 18 cases of prostatic adenocarcinoma. in addition, 5 (100%) of 5 endometrial stromal sarcomas, 3 (60%) of 5 rhabdomyosarcomas, 7 (50%) of 14 pancreatic adenocarcinomas, 5 (45%) of 11 cases of schwannoma, and 12 (40%) of 30 cases of malignant melanoma also were positive for cd10. similar to normal tissue, cd10 positivity was restricted to the apical surface of malignant glandular cells of well-differentiated colonic, pancreatic, and prostatic adenocarcinoma, whereas in poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and other tumors, such as melanoma, transitional cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and endometrial stromal sarcoma, the cd10 positivity showed diffuse cytoplasmic or membranous/golgi patterns. the monoclonal antibody clone 56c6 is a reliable marker for cd10 in paraffin immunohistochemistry after heat-induced epitope retrieval. cd10 expression in renal cell carcinoma and endometrial stromal sarcoma may be a useful marker in the differential diagnoses of these tumors because both tumors otherwise lack specific markers.
the expansion of heterochromatin blocks in rye reflects the co-amplification of tandem repeats and adjacent transposable elements bare-1 is a highly abundant, copia-like, ltr (long terminal repeat) retrotransposon in the genus hordeum. the ltrs provide the promoter, terminator, and polyadenylation signals necessary for the replicational life cycle of retrotransposons. we have examined the variability and evolution of bare-1-like elements, focusing on the ltrs. three groups were found, corresponding to each of the hordeum genome types analyzed, which predate the divergence of these types. the most variable ltr regions are tandem repeats near the 3′ end and the promoter. in barley (h. vulgare l.), two main classes of ltr promoters were defined, corresponding to bare-1 and to a new class we call bare-2. these can be considered as families within the group i bare elements. although less abundant in cultivated barley than is bare-1, bare-2 is transcriptionally active in leaves and calli. a sequenced bare-2 has more than 99% similar ltrs and perfect terminal direct repeats (tdrs), indicating it is a recent insertion, but the coding region, especially gag, is disrupted by frameshifts and stop codons. bare-2 appears to be a chimeric element resulting from retrotransposon recombination by strand switching during replication, with ltrs and 5′utr more similar to bare-1 and the rest more similar to wis-2. we provide evidence as well for another form of recombination, where ltr-ltr recombination has generated tandem multimeric bare-1 elements in which internal coding domains are interspersed with shared ltrs. the data indicate that recombination contributes to the complexity and plasticity of retroelement evolution in plant genomes.
low cholesterol is associated with depression among us household population. primary prevention trials which have shown that the lowering of serum cholesterol concentrations in middle-aged subjects by diet, drugs, or both leads to a decrease in coronary heart disease have also reported an increase in deaths due to suicide or violence. there has been no adequate explanation for this association. i have reviewed the relevant published work and describe a physiological mechanism that might account for this curious finding. one of the functions of serotonin in the central nervous system is the suppression of harmful behavioural impulses. when mouse brain synaptosomal membrane cholesterol is increased there is a pronounced increase in the number of serotonin receptors. low membrane cholesterol decreases the number of serotonin receptors. since membrane cholesterol exchanges freely with cholesterol in the surrounding medium, a lowered serum cholesterol concentration may contribute to a decrease in brain serotonin, with poorer suppression of aggressive behaviour.

protein synthesis and protein phosphorylation during heat stress, recovery, and adaptation heat shock at 45 degrees c virtually abolishes protein synthesis in hela cells, but return to 37 degrees c effects a complete recovery and the concomitant synthesis of heat shock-induced proteins. heat shock induces polysome disaggregation, indicating initiation is principally inhibited. in vitro assays for initiation factor activities reveal heat shock inhibits eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eif-2), eif-(3 + 4f), and eif-4b. immunoblot analyses show that eif-2 alpha and eif-2 beta become modified during heat shock, and eif-4b variants disappear. upon return to 37 degrees c, these alterations reverse. the modifications of eif-2 alpha and eif-4b are due to phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, respectively. enzymatic activities induced by heat shock inhibit protein synthesis and modify initiation factors in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. initiation factor modifications may contribute to, or cause, protein synthesis inhibition.
transcriptional profiling reveals a role for roralpha in regulating gene expression in obesity-associated inflammation and hepatic steatosis. homozygous staggerermice (sg/sg) display decreased anddysfunctional retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor (ror ) expression.we observed decreases in serum (and liver) triglycerides and total and high density lipoprotein serum cholesterol in sg/sgmice. moreover, the sg/sgmice were characterized by reduced adiposity (associated with decreased fat pad mass and adipocyte size). candidate-based expression profiling demonstrated that the dyslipidemia in sg/sg mice is associated with decreased hepatic expression of srebp-1c, and the reverse cholesterol transporters,abca1 andabcg1. this is consistent with the reduced serum lipids. the molecular mechanism did not involve aberrant expression of lxr and/or chrebp. however, chip and transfection analyses revealed that ror is recruited to and regulates the activity of the srebp-1c promoter. furthermore, the lean phenotype in sg/sg mice is also characterized by significantly increased expression of pgc-1 , pgc-1 , and lipin1mrna in liver andwhite andbrownadipose tissue from sg/sg mice. in addition, we observed a significant 4-fold increase in 2-adrenergic receptor mrna in brown adipose tissue. finally, dysfunctional ror expression protects against diet-induced obesity. following a 10-week high fat diet, wild-type but not sg/sg mice exhibited a 20% weight gain, increased hepatic triglycerides, and notable white and brown adipose tissue accumulation. in summary, these changes in gene expression (that modulate lipid homeostasis) in metabolic tissues are involved in decreased adiposity and resistance to dietinduced obesity in the sg/sg mice, despite hyperphagia. in conclusion, we suggest this orphan nuclear receptor is a key modulator of fat accumulation and that selective ror modulators may have utility in the treatment of obesity.
effect of gastric acidification on the (14)c-ubt heliprobe(®) accuracy during pantoprazole treatment in helicobacter pylori positive patients. background/aims omeprazole, a benzimidazole proton pump inhibitor, has an antibacterial effect against helicobacter pylori at neutral ph and inhibits its urease activity. the aim of this study was to characterize h. pylori acid resistance and to determine whether omeprazole effects its survival at low ph.   methods we studied survival of h. pylori and other enteric organisms in buffered solutions (ph 2-7) in the presence or absence of 10 mmol/l urea and/or omeprazole.   results in the absence of urea, the acid tolerances of wild-type h. pylori, a urease-negative h. pylori mutant, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis were similar. in the presence of urea, the survival of the wild-type h. pylori at ph 2 was significantly greater than that of the other organisms. omeprazole (100 micrograms/ml) had a marked inhibitory effect on the survival of both wild-type and urease-negative h. pylori at low ph, and similar effects on e. coli, p. mirabilis, and salmonella typhimurium.   conclusions whereas survival of h. pylori below ph 4 is urease dependent, h. pylori uses non-urease-mediated mechanisms at or above ph 4. omeprazole inhibits the survival of h. pylori at low ph through a mechanism independent of its effect on urease, an antibacterial effect that extends to other enteric bacteria.
but affirmative action hurts us! race-related beliefs shape perceptions of white disadvantage and policy unfairness the present experiments suggest that the desire to benefit the in-group drives dominant-group members' policy preferences, independent of concern for out-groups' outcomes. in experiment 1, the effect of a manipulation of affirmative action procedures on policy support was mediated by how whites expected the policy to affect fellow whites, but not by the expected effect on minorities. in experiments 2 and 3, when focused on losses for the white in-group, whites' racial identity was negatively related to support for affirmative action. however, when focused on gains for the black out-group or when participants were told that whites were not affected by the policy, racial identity did not predict attitudes toward the policy. in experiments 2 and 3, perceived fairness mediated these effects.
the male role in pregnancy loss and embryo implantation failure pregnancy establishment and maintenance represents a challenge for the maternal immune system because it has to be alert against pathogens while tolerating paternal alloantigens expressed in fetal structures. regulatory t cells (tregs) are important for successful implantation and involved in allotolerance towards paternal antigens. the origin and mechanisms leading to treg generation during pregnancy at different stages remain under discussion. we report an accumulation of helios(+) tregs in thymus and in the lymph nodes draining the uterus at early pregnancy. at later pregnancy stages an expanded population of foxp3(+) tregs was generated in the periphery as we showed in a rag-1(-/-) model of cell transfer. our data suggest that tregs, predominantly of thymic origin, are needed for pregnancy establishment. at later pregnancy stages an extra thymic treg population contributes to the treg pool in the periphery. our data provides new insights in the origin of tregs during pregnancy that are essential to understand natural mechanisms of tolerance acquisition.
epigallocatechin-3-gallate, a histone acetyltransferase inhibitor, inhibits ebv-induced b lymphocyte transformation via suppression of rela acetylation. ikappabalpha is an inhibitory molecule that sequesters nf-kappab dimers in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells. upon stimulation, nf-kappab moves to the nucleus and induces the expression of a variety of genes including ikappabalpha. this newly synthesized ikappabalpha also translocates to the nucleus, removes activated nf-kappab from its target genes, and brings it back to the cytoplasm to terminate the phase of nf-kappab activation. we show here that ikappabalpha enhances the transactivation potential of several homeodomain-containing proteins such as hoxb7 and pit-1 through a nf-kappab-independent association with histone deacetylase (hdac) 1 and hdac3 but not with hdac2, -4, -5, and -6. ikappabalpha bound both hdac proteins through its ankyrin repeats, and this interaction was disrupted by p65. immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated further that ikappabalpha acts by partially redirecting hdac3 to the cytoplasm. at the same time, an ikappabalpha mutant, which lacked a functional nuclear localization sequence, interacted very efficiently with hdac1 and -3 and intensively enhanced the transactivation potential of pit-1. our results support the hypothesis that the nf-kappab inhibitor ikappabalpha regulates the transcriptional activity of homeodomain-containing proteins positively through cytoplasmic sequestration of hdac1 and hdac3, a mechanism that would assign a new and unexpected role to ikappabalpha.
laminin-chitosan-plga conduit co-transplanted with schwann and neural stem cells to repair the injured recurrent laryngeal nerve a number of surprising observations have shown that stem cells, in suitable conditions, have the ability to produce a whole spectrum of cell types, regardless, whether these tissues are derived from the same germ layer or not. this phenomenon is called stem cell plasticity, which means that tissue-specific stem cells are mutually interchangeable. in our experiments, as a model, we used neural stem cells (nscs) harvested from fetal (e14-15) neocortex and beta-galactosidase positive. in the first experiment we found that on days 12 and 30 after sub-lethal irradiation (ld 8.5 gy) and (beta-galactosidase(+)) nscs transplantation all mice survived, just as the group with bone marrow transplantation. moreover, the bone marrow of mice transplanted nscs contained the number of cfu-gm colonies with beta-galactosidase(+) cells which was as much as 50% higher. these differences were statistically significant, p<0.001. in the second experiment, we studied kinetics of (beta-galactosidase(+)) nscs after their transplantation to sub-lethally irradiated mice. histochemistry of tissues was performed on days 12 and 30 post-transplantation, and beta-galactosidase(+) cells were detected with the help of histochemical examination of removed tissues (lung, liver, spleen, thymus, and skeletal muscle). in tissues removed on day 12 post-transplantation, we found a significantly higher number of beta-galactosidase(+) cells in the spleen and thymus on day 30. while we presumed the presence beta-galactosidase(+) cells in the spleen, as spleen and reticuloendothelial system represent an important retaining system for different cell types, the presence of beta-galactosidase(+) cells in the thymus was rather surprising but very interesting. this indicates a certain mutual and close interconnection of transplanted stem cells and immune system in an adult organism. in the third experiment, we verified the mutual interchange of sca-1 surface antigen in the bone marrow cells and nscs before transplantation. analysis of this antigen showed 24.8% sca-1 positive cells among the bone marrow cells, while nscs were sca-1 negative. our experiments show that nscs share hemopoietic identity and may significantly influence the recovery of damaged hematopoiesis but do not have typical superficial markers as hscs. this result is important for the determination of predictive factors for hemopoiesis recovery, for stem cell plasticity and for their use in the cell therapy.
sti571 prevents apoptosis, tau phosphorylation and behavioural impairments induced by alzheimer's beta-amyloid deposits. here, we investigated the intracellular mechanisms that underlie the relative invulnerability of adult versus developing dorsal root ganglion (drg) sensory neurons. in culture, adult neurons were resistant to stimuli that caused apoptosis of their neonatal counterparts. in both adult and neonatal neurons, death stimuli induced the apoptotic c-jun n-terminal protein kinase (jnk) pathway, but jnk activation only caused death of neonatal neurons, indicating that adult neurons have a downstream block to apoptosis. expression of the dominant-inhibitory p53 family member, δnp73, rescued jnk-induced apoptosis of neonatal neurons, suggesting that it might participate in the downstream apoptotic block in adult neurons. to test this possibility, we examined adult drg neurons cultured from p73+/- mice. adult p73+/- drg neurons were more vulnerable to apoptotic stimuli than their p73+/+ counterparts, and invulnerability could be restored to the p73+/- neurons by increased expression of δnp73. moreover, although drg neuron development was normal in p73+/- animals in vivo, axotomy caused death of adult p73+/- but not p73+/+ drg neurons. thus, one way adult neurons become invulnerable is to enhance endogenous survival pathways, and one critical component of these survival pathways is p73.
comparison of radiological and morphologic assessments of myocardial bridges our purpose in this study was to investigate the perivasculary space under the myocardial bridges (mb) in dog, sheep, goat and human hearts. a total of 160 hearts were studied, and perivasculary space under the myocardial bridges was examined under microscope. the specimens belonged to 25 dogs, 100 sheep, 25 goats and 10 humans. special attention was paid to evaluate the distance between the mb and coronary arteries (ca), ca and underlying myocardium (um) and to find the relation of concomitant vein number accompanying the ca and mb. 219 myocardial bridges were found in total of hearts, and specimens from these bridges were examined under microscope. there were large variations in distance between the mb and ca (0–714 µm) and distance between ca and um (0–309 µm). the myocardial bridges were classified into three groups in terms of the number of veins accompanying ca, the bridges with no concomitant veins with one concomitant vein and with two concomitant veins. this suggests that the distance between the mb and ca is crucial to determine how much force is on the ca. the environment surrounding the ca may be a crucial factor in determining whether the mb influences the induction of heart disorders or not.
inadequate use of prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism in danish medical departments. perioperative antithrombotic clinical regimens have reduced the incidence of postoperative deep venous thrombosis (dvt). long-term effects of asymptomatic postoperative dvt have been studied in a number of clinical trials and the present review describes the clinical significance of asymptomatic postoperative dvt regarding the possible development of postthrombotic syndrome (pts). we performed a systematic review of reference databases focusing upon studies including patients suspected of having postoperative dvt and reporting subsequent cases of pts at the end of a well-defined follow-up period. the included studies were stratified according to type of screening method and applied statistics. over-all evaluation included meta-analyses based upon the cochrane software package. the overall relative risk of developing pts was 1.58 (95% confidence intervals: 1.24-2.02) in patients suffering from asymptomatic dvt as compared to patients without dvt (p<0.0005). in conclusion, asymptomatic postoperative dvt is associated with an increased risk of late development of pts. the finding emphasizes that postoperative dvt, diagnosed by means of well-defined objective measures, remains the correct scientific endpoint in trials evaluating the efficacy of preoperative antithrombotic treatment regimens.
mutants lacking myosin ii cannot resist forces generated during multicellular morphogenesis. dictyostelium amebae have been engineered by homologous recombination of a truncated copy of the myosin heavy chain gene (heavy meromyosin (hmm) cells) and by transformation with a vector encoding an antisense rna to myosin heavy chain mrna (mhca cells) so that they lack native myosin heavy chain protein. in the former case, cells synthesize only the heavy meromyosin portion of the protein and in the latter case they synthesize negligible amounts of the protein. surprisingly, it was demonstrated that both cell lines are viable and motile. in order to compare the motility of these cells with normal cells, the newly developed computer-assisted dynamic morphology system (dms) was employed. the results demonstrate that the average hmm or mhca ameba moves at a rate of translocation less than half that of normal cells. it is rounder and less polar than a normal cell, and exhibits a rate of cytoplasmic expansion and contraction roughly half that of normal cells. in a spatial gradient of camp, the average ameba of hmm or mhca exhibits a chemotactic index of +0.10 or less, compared to the chemotactic index of +0.50 exhibited by normal cells. finally, the initial area, rate of expansion, and final area of pseudopods are roughly half that of normal cells. the five fastest hmm amebae (out of 35 analyzed in detail) moved at an average rate of translocation equal to that of normal amebae, and exhibited an average chemotactic index of +0.34. in addition, the average rate of cytoplasmic flow in fast hmm cells was equal to that of the average normal ameba. however, fast hmm amebae still exhibited the same defects in pseudopod formation that were exhibited by the entire hmm cell population. these results suggest that myosin heavy chain is involved in the "fine tuning" and efficiency of pseudopod formation, but is not essential for the basic behavior of pseudopod expansion.
evolution of a multigene family that encodes the kunitz chymotrypsin inhibitor in winged bean: a possible intermediate in the generation of a new gene with a distinct pattern of expression conversion between duplicated genes limits their independent evolution. models in which conversion frequencies decrease as genes diverge are examined to determine conditions under which genes can "escape" further conversion and hence escape from a gene family. a review of results from various recombination systems suggests two classes of sequence-dependence models: (1) the "k-hit" model in which conversion is completely inactivated by a few (k) mutational events, such as the insertion of a mobile element, and (2) more general models where conversion frequency gradually declines as genes diverge through the accumulation of point mutants. exact analysis of the k-hit model is given and an approximate analysis of a more general sequence-dependent model is developed and verified by computer simulation. if mu is the per nucleotide mutation rate, then neutral duplicated genes diverging through point mutants are likely to escape conversion provided 2 mu/lambda much greater than 0.1, where lambda is the conversion rate between identical genes. if 2 mu/lambda much less than 0.1, the expected number of conversions before escape increases exponentially so that, for biological purposes, the genes never escape conversion. for single mutational events sufficient to block further conversions, occurring at rate nu per copy per generation, many conversions are expected if 2 nu/lambda much less than 1, while the genes essentially evolve independently if 2 nu/lambda much greater than 1. implications of these results for both models of concerted evolution and the evolution of new gene functions via gene duplication are discussed.
a pooled analysis of body mass index and pancreatic cancer mortality in african americans overweight and obesity are health problems of epidemic proportions, increasing the risk not only of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus but also of various types of cancer. obesity is strongly associated with changes in the physiological function of adipose tissue, leading to insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, and altered secretion of adipokines. several of these factors, such as insulin resistance, increased levels of leptin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and endogenous sex steroids, decreased levels of adiponectin, and chronic inflammation, are involved in carcinogenesis and cancer progression. this article reviews these mechanisms, focusing on adipose tissue dysfunction as a unifying causal factor. although understanding of the link between obesity and cancer might provide therapeutic targets, preventing overweight and obesity still remains number one priority.

hierarchical cluster visualization in web mapping systems information visualisation is about gaining insight into data through a visual representation. this data is often multivariate and increasingly, the datasets are very large. to help us explore all this data, numerous visualisation applications, both commercial and research prototypes, have been designed using a variety of techniques and algorithms. whether they are dedicated to geo-spatial data or skewed hierarchical data, most of the visualisations need to adopt strategies for dealing with overcrowded displays, brought about by too much data to fit in too small a display space. this paper analyses a large number of these clutter reduction methods, classifying them both in terms of how they deal with clutter reduction and more importantly, in terms of the benefits and losses. the aim of the resulting taxonomy is to act as a guide to match techniques to problems where different criteria may have different importance, and more importantly as a means to critique and hence develop existing and new techniques.
a new look at care in pregnancy: simple, effective interventions for neglected populations background and objectives hookworm infection is among the major causes of anaemia in poor communities, but its importance in causing maternal anaemia is poorly understood, and this has hampered effective lobbying for the inclusion of anthelmintic treatment in maternal health packages. we sought to review existing evidence on the role of hookworm as a risk factor for anaemia among pregnant women. we also estimate the number of hookworm infections in pregnant women in sub-saharan africa (ssa). methods structured searches using medline and embase as well as manual searches of reference lists were conducted, and unpublished data were obtained by contacting authors. papers were independently reviewed by two authors, and relevant data were extracted. we compared haemoglobin concentration (hb) according to intensity of hookworm infection and calculated standardised mean differences and 95% confidence intervals. to estimate the number of pregnant women, we used population surfaces and a spatial model of hookworm prevalence. findings one hundred and five reports were screened and 19 were eligible for inclusion: 13 cross-sectional studies, 2 randomised controlled trials, 2 non-randomised treatment trials and 2 observational studies. comparing uninfected women and women lightly (1–1,999 eggs/gram [epg]) infected with hookworm, the standardised mean difference (smd) was −0.24 (95% ci: −0.36 to −0.13). the smd between women heavily (4000+ epg) infected and those lightly infected was −0.57 (95% ci: −0.87 to −0.26). all identified intervention studies showed a benefit of deworming for maternal or child health, but since a variety of outcomes measures were employed, quantitative evaluation was not possible. we estimate that 37.7 million women of reproductive age in ssa are infected with hookworm in 2005 and that approximately 6.9 million pregnant women are infected. conclusions evidence indicates that increasing hookworm infection intensity is associated with lower haemoglobin levels in pregnant women in poor countries. there are insufficient data to quantify the benefits of deworming, and further studies are warranted. given that between a quarter and a third of pregnant women in ssa are infected with hookworm and at risk of preventable hookworm-related anaemia, efforts should be made to increase the coverage of anthelmintic treatment among pregnant women.
reduced gene expression of intestinal alpha-defensins predicts diarrhea in a cohort of african adults. to determine the response of the small intestinal mucosa to environmental conditions, we studied changes in mucosal architecture and function in a longitudinal cohort study in african adults. over three consecutive years, 238 adults submitted monthly stool samples for parasitologic and bacteriologic analysis and underwent an annual endoscopic jejunal biopsy for mucosal morphometry. absorption and permeability assays were performed on the same day as the enteroscopy. variation in mucosal architecture and function was correlated with environmental factors and stool microbiology. the whole cohort had structural and functional evidence of tropical enteropathy, but structure and function were only weakly correlated. there were marked changes over time, and seasonal variation was observed in villous height (16%), xylose recovery (16%), and permeability (28%). asymptomatic intestinal infections were common. enteropathy was more severe in participants with citrobacter rodentium or hookworm ova in the stool sample taken one month before the investigations were performed.
isolation, characterization, and heterologous expression of the novel lantibiotic epicidin 280 and analysis of its biosynthetic gene cluster lantibiotics form a group of modified peptides with unique structures, containing post-translationally modified amino acids such as dehydrated and lanthionine residues. in the gram-positive bacteria that secrete these lantibiotics, the gene clusters flanking the structural genes for various linear (type a) lantibiotics have recently been characterized. the best studied representatives are those of nisin (nis), subtilin (spa), epidermin (epi), pep5 (pep), cytolysin (cyl), lactocin s (las) and lacticin 481 (lct). comparison of the lantibiotic gene clusters shows that they contain conserved genes that probably encode similar functions.the nis, spa, epi and pep clusters contain lanb and lanc genes that are presumed to code for two types of enzymes that have been implicated in the modification reactions characteristic of all lantibiotics, i.e. dehydration and thio-ether ring formation. the cyl, las and lct gene clusters have no homologue of the lanb gene, but they do contain a much larger lanm gene that is the lanc gene homologue. most lantibiotic gene clusters contain a lanp gene encoding a serine protease that is presumably involved in the proteolytic processing of the prelantibiotics. all clusters contain a lant gene encoding and abc transporter likely to be involved in the export of (precursors of) the lantibiotics. the lane, lanf and lang genes in the nis, spa and epi clusters encode another transport system that is possibly involved in self-protection. in the nisin and subtilin gene clusters two tandem genes, lanr and lank, have been located that code for a two-component regulatory system.finally, non-homologous genes are found in some lantibiotic gene clusters. the nisl and spal genes encode lipoproteins that are involved in immunity, the pepi gene encodes a membrane-located immunity protein, and epid encodes an enzyme involved in a post-translational modification found only in the c-terminus of epidermin. several genes of unknown function are also found in the las gene cluster.a database has been assembled for all putative gene products of type a lantibiotic gene clusters. database searches, multiple sequence alignment and secondary structure prediction have been used to identify conserved sequence segments in the lanb, lanc, lane, lanf, lang, lank, lanm, lanp, lanr and lant gene products that may be essential for structure and function. this database allows for a rapid screening of newly determined sequences in lantibiotic gene clusters.
long-term tracking by decision making this paper presents a method for acquiring dense nonrigid shape and deformation from a single monocular depth sensor. we focus on modeling the human hand, and assume that a single rough template model is available. we combine and extend existing work on model-based tracking, subdivision surface fitting, and mesh deformation to acquire detailed hand models from as few as 15 frames of depth data. we propose an objective that measures the error of fit between each sampled data point and a continuous model surface defined by a rigged control mesh, and uses as-rigid-as-possible (arap) regularizers to cleanly separate the model and template geometries. a key contribution is our use of a smooth model based on subdivision surfaces that allows simultaneous optimization over both correspondences and model parameters. this avoids the use of iterated closest point (icp) algorithms which often lead to slow convergence. automatic initialization is obtained using a regression forest trained to infer approximate correspondences. experiments show that the resulting meshes model the user's hand shape more accurately than just adapting the shape parameters of the skeleton, and that the retargeted skeleton accurately models the user's articulations. we investigate the effect of various modeling choices, and show the benefits of using subdivision surfaces and arap regularization.
biomarker-based prediction of progression in mci: comparison of ad signature and hippocampal volume with spinal fluid amyloid-β and tau in 2010, we put forward a hypothetical model of the major biomarkers of alzheimer's disease (ad). the model was received with interest because we described the temporal evolution of ad biomarkers in relation to each other and to the onset and progression of clinical symptoms. since then, evidence has accumulated that supports the major assumptions of this model. evidence has also appeared that challenges some of our assumptions, which has allowed us to modify our original model. refinements to our model include indexing of individuals by time rather than clinical symptom severity; incorporation of interindividual variability in cognitive impairment associated with progression of ad pathophysiology; modifications of the specific temporal ordering of some biomarkers; and recognition that the two major proteinopathies underlying ad biomarker changes, amyloid β (aβ) and tau, might be initiated independently in sporadic ad, in which we hypothesise that an incident aβ pathophysiology can accelerate antecedent limbic and brainstem tauopathy.
maternal union instability and childhood mortality risk in the global south, 2010–14 although children's family lives are diverse, the measurement of children's living arrangements has lagged, focusing on the relationships of children to parents while largely ignoring sibling composition. using data from the 2008 survey of income and program participation (n = 23,985) the authors documented patterns of family complexity among a nationally representative sample of children ages 0-17 living in a range of family structures. they also examined the independent and joint associations of family structure and family complexity on child economic well-being. family complexity was independently related to economic disadvantage, namely, a lower income-to-needs ratio and a higher likelihood of public assistance receipt. the role of family complexity was partially contingent on family structure, with the positive association between family complexity and receipt of public assistance more pronounced for children in families with 2 married biological parents. this study demonstrates the utility of integrating family structure and family complexity in studies of children's well-being.
bax‐mediated cell death by the gax homeoprotein requires mitogen activation but is independent of cell cycle activity the transduction of vascular myocytes with exogenous genetic material will be a common feature of many gene-based therapies for cardiovascular disorders. therefore, the successful application of cardiovascular gene therapy will require a thorough understanding of the molecular biology of the smooth muscle cell. of key importance are the transcriptional regulatory events that coordinate the de-differentiation and proliferation of myocytes in response to vascular injury. the goal of this review is to highlight what is known about the regulators of vascular myocyte transcription that may serve as candidate genes for the development of genetic strategies to manage postinterventional restenosis.
the utility of impulsive bias and altered decision making as predictors of drug efficacy and target selection: rethinking behavioral screening for antidepressant drugs rationalen-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (nmdar) antagonists such as ketamine induce cognitive symptoms in man similar to those of schizophrenia and therefore might be useful as models of the disease in animals. however, it is unclear which nmdar antagonist(s) offer the best means to produce cognitive deficits in attention and working memory and to what extent those deficits can be measured selectively in rats.objectivesthe present study systematically compared the effects of eight different nmdar antagonists—mk-801, phencyclidine, (s)-(+)-ketamine, memantine, sdz-220,581, ro 25-6981, cp 101-606 and nvp-aam077—in rats using standard tests of visual attention, the five-choice serial reaction time task (5csrt), and working memory, the delayed matching to position task (dmtp).resultsdrug-induced responses varied qualitatively and quantitatively in both a compound- and a task-dependent manner. effects were generally confounded by concomitant motor and motivational disruption, although individual doses of phencyclidine for example appeared to impair selectively cognitive functions. interestingly, glun2b selective antagonists were unique in their effects; inducing potential performance benefit in the 5csrt.conclusionsoverall, the opportunity to induce a selective cognitive deficit in attention (5csrt) or working memory (dmtp) in the rat is limited by both the nmdar antagonist and the dose range used. the importance of a preclinical focus on ketamine, which is used more frequently in clinical settings, is limited by the extent to which cognitive effects can be both detected and quantified using this exposure regimen within these two operant assays.
snp variants in ret and pax2 and their possible contribution to the primary hyperoxaluria type 1 phenotype during kidney development, pax2 and pax8 are expressed very early in the mammalian nephric duct and both precede the expression of receptor tyrosine kinase, c-ret. however, in pax2-/- mutant mice, expression of c-ret is lost after embryonic day 10.5. as the ret/gdnf pathway is necessary for renal development and there is a temporal and spatial relationship of pax2 and c-ret expression in the developing genito-urinary system, we postulate that pax2 is necessary for c-ret expression in the developing kidney. in vitro, pax2 protein is capable of physically interacting with a c-ret promoter, and both pax2 and pax8 can activate the expression of a reporter gene driven by the c-ret promoter. compound heterozygous null mice (pax2+/-: ret+/-) display an increased incidence of unilateral and bilateral renal agenesis, and smaller kidneys with fewer nephrons. furthermore, the expression of gdnf is reduced 2-3-fold, whereas c-ret expression is reduced 9-47-fold in pax2 heterozygous embryonic kidneys as detected by real-time quantitative rt (qrt)-pcr. the data demonstrate that pax2 plays an integral role in the initiation and maintenance of the ret/gdnf pathway by not only activating the ligand of the pathway, but by also enhancing the expression of the pathway receptor ret. the effects of reduced pax2 gene dosage are thus amplified resulting in a haploinsufficient phenotype.
resistance to diet-induced obesity in mice with a single substituted chromosome. values of insulin-mediated glucose disposal vary continuously throughout a population of apparently healthy persons, and a difference of > or = 600% exists between the most insulin-sensitive and the most insulin-resistant persons. approximately 50% of this variability can be attributed to differences in adiposity (25%) and fitness (25%), with the remaining 50% likely of genetic origin. the more insulin-resistant a person, the more likely that he or she will develop some degree of glucose intolerance, high triacylglycerol and low hdl concentrations, essential hypertension, and procoagulant and proinflammatory states, all of which increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (cvd). to identify persons at greater cvd risk because of these abnormalities, the world health organization, the adult treatment panel iii, and the international diabetes federation created a new diagnostic category, the metabolic syndrome. although the components of the 3 versions of the metabolic syndrome are similar, the specific values for those components that define an abnormality are somewhat different, and the manner in which the abnormalities are used to make a positive diagnosis varies dramatically from version to version. this review will summarize the similarities in and differences between the 3 versions of the metabolic syndrome, point out that the clustering of components that make up all 3 definitions of the metabolic syndrome is not accidental and occurs only in insulin-resistant persons, develop the argument that diagnosing the metabolic syndrome in a person has neither pedagogical nor clinical utility, and suggest that the clinical emphasis should be on treating effectively any cvd risk factor that is present.
effects of dose, flow rate, and bile acid on diclofenac disposition in the perfused rat liver the "hepatic arterial buffer response" hypothesis states that the hepatic artery is not controlled by liver parenchymal cell metabolic activity. bile salts stimulate liver metabolism (elevate bile formation) and dilate the hepatic artery. the present data show that the vascular and metabolic effects in cats anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium are independent. low doses of taurocholate (1 microm . min-1 . kg-1) produce metabolic but not vascular responses. at higher doses both the hepatic artery and superior mesenteric artery dilate with equal sensitivity. taurocholate into the portal vein produced elevated bile flow and hepatic arterial dilation; infusion via the hepatic artery resulted in equal metabolic responses but much greater vascular effects. in addition, the time course of onset and termination of the metabolic and vascular responses supports the conclusion that the effects of taurocholic acid on hepatic bile flow and hepatic arterial flow are independent actions. this adds further support for the hepatic arterial buffer response being controlled by factors other than local hepatic metabolic demands.
necessity of organized low-dose computed tomography screening for lung cancer: from epidemiologic comparisons between china and the western nations background the aggressive and heterogeneous nature of lung cancer has thwarted efforts to reduce mortality from this cancer through the use of screening. the advent of low-dose helical computed tomography (ct) altered the landscape of lung-cancer screening, with studies indicating that low-dose ct detects many tumors at early stages. the national lung screening trial (nlst) was conducted to determine whether screening with low-dose ct could reduce mortality from lung cancer.   methods from august 2002 through april 2004, we enrolled 53,454 persons at high risk for lung cancer at 33 u.s. medical centers. participants were randomly assigned to undergo three annual screenings with either low-dose ct (26,722 participants) or single-view posteroanterior chest radiography (26,732). data were collected on cases of lung cancer and deaths from lung cancer that occurred through december 31, 2009.   results the rate of adherence to screening was more than 90%. the rate of positive screening tests was 24.2% with low-dose ct and 6.9% with radiography over all three rounds. a total of 96.4% of the positive screening results in the low-dose ct group and 94.5% in the radiography group were false positive results. the incidence of lung cancer was 645 cases per 100,000 person-years (1060 cancers) in the low-dose ct group, as compared with 572 cases per 100,000 person-years (941 cancers) in the radiography group (rate ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.03 to 1.23). there were 247 deaths from lung cancer per 100,000 person-years in the low-dose ct group and 309 deaths per 100,000 person-years in the radiography group, representing a relative reduction in mortality from lung cancer with low-dose ct screening of 20.0% (95% ci, 6.8 to 26.7; p=0.004). the rate of death from any cause was reduced in the low-dose ct group, as compared with the radiography group, by 6.7% (95% ci, 1.2 to 13.6; p=0.02).   conclusions screening with the use of low-dose ct reduces mortality from lung cancer.

creation of a cleft in an angiography catheter to facilitate catheterization of branches of the aorta arising at an acute angle. purposeto evaluate the incidence of each extrahepatic collateral pathway to hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) and to assess technical success rates and complications of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (tace) through each collateral.methodswe retrospective evaluated extrahepatic collateral pathways to hcc on angiography in 386 procedures on 181 consecutive patients. one hundred and seventy patients had previously undergone tace. tace through extrahepatic collaterals using iodized oil and gelatin sponge particles was performed when a catheter was advanced into the tumor-feeding branch to avoid nontarget embolization.resultsa single collateral was revealed in 275 tace procedures, two were revealed in 74, and three or more were revealed in 34. incidences of collateral source to hcc were 83% from the right inferior phrenic artery (ipa), 24% from the cystic artery, 13% from the omental artery, 12% from the right renal capsular artery (rca) and left ipa, 8% from the right internal mammary artery (ima) and right intercostal artery (ica), and 7% from the right inferior adrenal artery (iaa). technical success rates of tace were 53% in the right ica, 70% in the cystic artery, 74% in the omental artery, 93% in the left ipa, 96% in the right ipa, and 100% in the right rca, right ima, and right iaa. complications included skin necrosis after tace through the right ima (n = 1), cholecystitis after tace through the cystic artery (n = 1), and ulcer formation after tace through the right gastric artery (n = 1), in addition to pleural effusion and basal atelectasis after tace through the ipa and ima.conclusionour study suggests that tace through extrahepatic collaterals is possible with high success rates, and is also relatively safe.
unsupervised video summarization with adversarial lstm networks we present a novel method for summarizing raw, casually captured videos. the objective is to create a short summary that still conveys the story. it should thus be both, interesting and representative for the input video. previous methods often used simplified assumptions and only optimized for one of these goals. alternatively, they used handdefined objectives that were optimized sequentially by making consecutive hard decisions. this limits their use to a particular setting. instead, we introduce a new method that (i) uses a supervised approach in order to learn the importance of global characteristics of a summary and (ii) jointly optimizes for multiple objectives and thus creates summaries that posses multiple properties of a good summary. experiments on two challenging and very diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, where we outperform or match current state-of-the-art.
correlation of midbrain diameter and gait disturbance in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus we present nine cases of obstructive hydrocephalus (oh) associated with marked parkinsonism. four patients had noncommunicating oh (ncoh) [three nontumoral aqueductal stenosis (as), one tumoral as]. the presentation was that of acute or subacute parkinsonism, usually at the time of acute recurrent ventricular obstruction. three had a marked response to levodopa and required short‐term treatment after shunting. however, one has remained levodopa dependent after 21/2 years. three of the five patients with communicating oh (coh) presented with shunt‐responsive normal pressure hydrocephalus (nph), only later to develop progressive parkinsonism. one of these was found to have progressive supranuclear palsy (psp) at autopsy and psp was clinically susepected in one other patient. a third had an atypical course suggestive of psp; however, autopsy demonstrated the combination of lewy body parkinsonism and the sequelae of hydrocephalus. the remaining two coh patients presented with levodopa‐responsive parkinsonism. subsequent clinical features and imaging studies suggested the presence of nph. the pathophysiology of hydrocephalic parkinsonism probably involves variable sites of dysfunction in the nigrostriatal pathway and/or the cortico‐striato‐pallido‐thalamo‐cortical circuit. at certain locations these pathways lie in close proximity to the ventricular system and may be subjected to mass effects and ischemic changes secondary to ventriculomegaly. the additional importance of possible associations between subcortical cerebral ischemia, nph, and “degenerative” disorders such as psp and parkinson's disease is discussed.
prediction of nucleosome rotational positioning in yeast and human genomes based on sequence-dependent dna anisotropy abstract recent studies of genome-wide nucleosomal organization suggest that the dna sequence is one of the major determinants of nucleosome positioning. although the search for underlying patterns encoded in nucleosomal dna has been going on for about 30 years, our knowledge of these patterns still remains limited. based on our evaluations of dna deformation energy, we developed new scoring functions to predict nucleosome positioning. there are three principal differences between our approach and earlier studies: (i) we assume that the length of nucleosomal dna varies from 146 to 147 bp; (ii) we consider the anisotropic flexibility of pyrimidine-purine (yr) dimeric steps in the context of their neighbors (e.g., yyrr versus ryry); (iii) we postulate that alternating at-rich and gc-rich motifs reflect sequence-dependent interactions between histone arginines and dna in the minor groove. using these functions, we analyzed 20 nucleosome positions mapped in vitro at single nucleotide resolution (including clones 601, 603, 605, the pgub plasmid, chicken β-globin and three 5s rdna genes). we predicted 15 of the 20 positions with 1-bp precision, and two positions with 2-bp precision. the predicted position of the ‘601’ nucleosome (i.e., the optimum of the computed score) deviates from the experimentally determined unique position by no more than 1 bp—an accuracy exceeding that of earlier predictions. our analysis reveals a clear heterogeneity of the nucleosomal sequences which can be divided into two groups based on the positioning ‘rules’ they follow. the sequences of one group are enriched by highly deformable yr/yyrr motifs at the minor-groove bending sites shl ±3.5 and ±5.5, which is similar to the α-satellite sequence used in most crystallized nucleosomes. apparently, the positioning of these nucleosomes is determined by the interactions between histones h2a/h2b and the terminal parts of nucleosomal dna. in the other group (that includes the ‘601’ clone) the same yr/yyrr motifs occur predominantly at the sites shl ±1.5. the interaction between the h3/h4 tetramer and the central part of the nucleosomal dna is likely to be responsible for the positioning of nucleosomes of this group, and the dna trajectory in these nucleosomes may differ in detail from the published structures. thus, from the stereochemical perspective, the in vitro nucleosomes studied here follow either an x-ray-like pattern (with strong deformations in the terminal parts of nucleosomal dna), or an alternative pattern (with the deformations occurring predominantly in the central part of the nucleosomal dna). the results presented here may be useful for genome-wide classification of nucleosomes, linking together structural and thermodynamic characteristics of nucleosomes with the underlying dna sequence patterns guiding their positions.
losartan treatment protects retinal ganglion cells and alters scleral remodeling in experimental glaucoma accumulation of specific deposits and extracellular molecules under the retinal pigment epithelium (rpe) has been previously observed in eyes with age-related macular degeneration (amd) and may play a role in the pathogenesis of amd. even though age is the major determinant for developing amd, clinical studies have revealed hypertension (htn) as another systemic risk factor. angiotensin ii (ang ii) is considered the most important hormone associated with htn. to evaluate the relationship of ang ii to amd, we studied whether mouse rpe expresses functional ang ii receptor subtypes and whether htn-induced ang ii regulates expression of these receptors as well as critical ecm molecules (mmp-2 and type iv collagen) involved in ecm turnover in rpe. we used 9-month-old c57bl/6 male mice infused with ang ii alone or ang ii in combination with the at1 receptor antagonist candesartan or the at2 receptor antagonist pd123319 for 4 weeks to determine whether htn-associated ang ii was important for ecm regulation in rpe. we found that mouse rpe expressed both ang ii receptor subtypes at the mrna and protein levels. infusion with ang ii induced htn and elevated plasma and ocular ang ii levels. ang ii also regulated at1a and at1b receptor mrna expression, the intracellular concentration of calcium [ca(2+)](i), mmp-2 activity, and type iv collagen accumulation. concurrent administration of ang ii with the at1 receptor blocker prevented the increase in blood pressure and rise in ocular ang ii levels, as well as the calcium and mmp-2 responses. in contrast, the type iv collagen response to ang ii was prevented by blockade of at2 receptors, but not at1 receptors. plasma ang ii levels were not modified by the at1 or at2 receptor blockade. since the effects of ang ii on mmp-2 and type iv collagen require inhibition of both ang ii receptor subtypes, these receptors may play a role as a potential therapeutic targets to prevent ecm turnover dysregulation in the rpe basement membrane, suggesting a pathogenic mechanism to explain the link between htn and amd.
human pih1 associates with histone h4 to mediate the glucose-dependent enhancement of pre-rrna synthesis. the snf2h-containing chromatin-remodeling complex norc is responsible for silencing a fraction of mammalian rrna genes (rdna). norc silences transcription by establishing heterochromatic features-including dna methylation, hypoacetylation of histone h4, and methylation of h3k9-at the rdna promoter []. we have investigated the mechanism of norc-mediated rdna silencing and show that binding of the bromodomain of tip5, the large subunit of norc, to acetylated nucleosomes is a prerequisite for norc function. a point mutation within the bromodomain impairs the association of norc with chromatin, prevents heterochromatin formation, and abolishes transcriptional repression. moreover, the association of norc with chromatin requires acetylation of histone h4 at lysine 16 (ach4k16), and binding to ach4k16 is required for subsequent deacetylation of h4k5, h4k8, and h4k12, indicating that acetylation of h4k16 plays an active role in norc-mediated heterochromatin formation. the bromodomain cooperates with an adjacent phd finger to recruit hdac1, dnmt1, dnmt3, and snf2h to rdna. if specifically targeted to the rdna promoter, the phd finger/bromodomain is capable of establishing heterochromatic features and rdna silencing. thus, the phd finger/bromodomain represents an autonomous unit that binds to ach4k16 and coordinates the chain of events that establish the repressed state of rdna.
efficacy of pharmacotherapy in bipolar disorder: a report by the wpa section on pharmacopsychiatry objective in a naturalistic follow-up of adult bipolar patients, the authors examined the contributions of demographic, phenomenological, and clinical variables, including antidepressant use, to prospectively observed mood episode frequency.   method for 1,742 bipolar i and ii patients in the systematic treatment enhancement program for bipolar disorder (step-bd), episodes of mood disorders were evaluated for up to 1 year of treatment.   results at entry, 32% of the patients met the dsm-iv criteria for rapid cycling in the prestudy year. of the 1,742 patients, 551 (32%) did not complete 1 year of treatment. among the 1,191 patients remaining, those with prior rapid cycling (n=356) were more likely to have further recurrences, although not necessarily more than four episodes per year. at the end of 12 months, only 5% (n=58) of the patients could be classified as rapid cyclers; 34% (n=409) had no further mood episodes, 34% (n=402) experienced one episode, and 27% (n=322) had two or three episodes. patients who entered the study with earlier illness onset and greater severity were more likely to have one or more episodes in the prospective study year. antidepressant use during follow-up was associated with more frequent mood episodes.   conclusions while dsm-iv rapid cycling was prospectively observed in only a small percentage of patients, the majority of these patients had continued recurrences at lower but clinically significant rates. this suggests that cycling is on a continuum and that prevention of recurrences may require early intervention and restricted use of antidepressants.
neuronal remodeling during metamorphosis is regulated by the alan shepard (shep) gene in drosophila melanogaster abstract the basic helix-loop-helix (bhlh) protein dimmed (dimm) supports the differentiation of secretory properties in numerous peptidergic cells of drosophila melanogaster. dimm is coexpressed with diverse amidated neuropeptides and with the amidating enzyme peptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monooxygenase (phm) in approximately 300 cells of the late embryo. here we confirm that dimm has transcription factor activity in transfected hek 293 cells and that the phm gene is a direct target. the mammalian dimm orthologue mist1 also transactivated the phm gene. dimm activity was dependent on the basic region of the protein and on the sequences of three e-box sites within phm's first intron; the sites make different contributions to the total activity. these data suggest a model whereby the three e boxes interact cooperatively and independently to produce high phm transcriptional activation. this dimm-controlled phm regulatory region displayed similar properties in vivo. spatially, its expression mirrored that of the dimm protein, and its activity was largely dependent on dimm. further, in vivo expression was highly dependent on the sequences of the same three e boxes. this study supports the hypothesis that dimm is a master regulator of a peptidergic cell fate in drosophila and provides a detailed transcriptional mechanism of dimm action on a defined target gene.
linear and branched perfluorooctane sulfonate (pfos) isomer patterns differ among several tissues and blood of polar bears. long-term temporal trends (1991-2008) and spatial differences of perfluoroalkylated substances (pfass) were investigated in harbor porpoise (phocoena phocoena) liver samples of juvenile females from the baltic and north sea. additionally, spatial differences between the populations in the baltic sea and atlantic ocean (i.e. iceland and norway) and the influence of the body mass, age and sex on the pfas concentrations were examined. perfluorooctane sulfonate (pfos) was the predominant compound with a concentration range of 160-2425 ng/g wet weight (ww), followed by perfluorooctane sulfonamide (pfosa, 1-237 ng/g ww) and perfluoroundecanoate (pfuna, 3-124 ng/g ww). in terms of temporal trends, perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (pfsas) and pfosa concentrations decreased over time, while, conversely, the c(9)-c(13) perfluoroalkyl carboxylate (pfca) concentrations increased. spatial distribution of the contaminant concentrations showed consistently higher concentrations in the baltic sea and lowest concentrations in the icelandic population of the atlantic ocean.
identification, cloning, and functional expression of three glutathione transferase genes from aspergillus fumigatus. the glutathione s-transferases (gst) represent a major group of detoxification enzymes. all eukaryotic species possess multiple cytosolic and membrane-bound gst isoenzymes, each of which displays distinct catalytic as well as noncatalytic binding properties: the cytosolic enzymes are encoded by at least five distantly related gene families (designated class alpha, mu, pi, sigma, and theta gst), whereas the membrane-bound enzymes, microsomal gst and leukotriene c4 synthetase, are encoded by single genes and both have arisen separately from the soluble gst. evidence suggests that the level of expression of gst is a crucial factor in determining the sensitivity of cells to a broad spectrum of toxic chemicals. in this article the biochemical functions of gst are described to show how individual isoenzymes contribute to resistance to carcinogens, antitumor drugs, environmental pollutants, and products of oxidative stress. a description of the mechanisms of transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of gst isoenzymes is provided to allow identification of factors that may modulate resistance to specific noxious chemicals. the most abundant mammalian gst are the class alpha, mu, and pi enzymes and their regulation has been studied in detail. the biological control of these families is complex as they exhibit sex-, age-, tissue-, species-, and tumor-specific patterns of expression. in addition, gst are regulated by a structurally diverse range of xenobiotics and, to date, at least 100 chemicals have been identified that induce gst; a significant number of these chemical inducers occur naturally and, as they are found as nonnutrient components in vegetables and citrus fruits, it is apparent that humans are likely to be exposed regularly to such compounds. many inducers, but not all, effect transcriptional activation of gst genes through either the antioxidant-responsive element (are), the xenobiotic-responsive element (xre), the gst p enhancer 1(gpe), or the glucocorticoid-responsive element (gre). barbiturates may transcriptionally activate gst through a barbie box element. the involvement of the ah-receptor, maf, nrl, jun, fos, and nf-kappa b in gst induction is discussed. many of the compounds that induce gst are themselves substrates for these enzymes, or are metabolized (by cytochrome p-450 monooxygenases) to compounds that can serve as gst substrates, suggesting that gst induction represents part of an adaptive response mechanism to chemical stress caused by electrophiles. it also appears probable that gst are regulated in vivo by reactive oxygen species (ros), because not only are some of the most potent inducers capable of generating free radicals by redox-cycling, but h2o2 has been shown to induce gst in plant and mammalian cells: induction of gst by ros would appear to represent an adaptive response as these enzymes detoxify some of the toxic carbonyl-, peroxide-, and epoxide-containing metabolites produced within the cell by oxidative stress. class alpha, mu, and pi gst isoenzymes are overexpressed in rat hepatic preneoplastic nodules and the increased levels of these enzymes are believed to contribute to the multidrug-resistant phenotype observed in these lesions. the majority of human tumors and human tumor cell lines express significant amounts of class pi gst. cell lines selected in vitro for resistance to anticancer drugs frequently overexpress class pi gst, although overexpression of class alpha and mu isoenzymes is also often observed. the mechanisms responsible for overexpression of gst include transcriptional activation, stabilization of either mrna or protein, and gene amplification. in humans, marked interindividual differences exist in the expression of class alpha, mu, and theta gst. the molecular basis for the variation in class alpha gst is not known.

molecular and electrophysiological characterization of gabaergic interneurons expressing the transcription factor coup-tfii in the adult human temporal cortex while the cortical interneurons derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (mge) migrate rather diffusely into the cortex, interneurons that migrate out from the caudal ganglionic eminence (cge) mainly move caudally into the caudal cerebral cortex and the hippocampus in the form of the caudal migratory stream (cms) (yozu et al., 2005). although transplantation experiments at embryonic day 13.5 had revealed that the migrating cells in these two populations are already intrinsically different in regard to their ability to respond to the cge environment (yozu et al., 2005), it is not known how the cge cells are specified and how their migratory behavior is determined. in this study we showed that, although cge and lateral ganglionic eminence (lge) express almost the same marker molecules, lge cells do not migrate caudally when transplanted into the cge, suggesting that lge cells are intrinsically different from cge cells. we therefore compared the transcriptomes of the cge, mge, and lge, and the results showed that coup-tfii was expressed preferentially in the cge as well as in the migrating interneurons in the cms. transplantation experiments revealed that coup-tfii is sufficient to change the direction of mge cell migration to caudal when transplanted into the cge environment, and knockdown of coup-tfii inhibited the caudal migration of the cge cells. these results suggest that coup-tfii is both required and sufficient for the cge-cell-specific migratory behavior in the caudal direction. thus, a locally expressed transcription factor determines the migratory direction of the cortical interneurons in a region-specific manner.
finding common protein interaction patterns across organisms y‐family dna polymerases can replicate past a variety of damaged bases in vitro but, with the exception of dna polymerase η (polη), which is defective in xeroderma pigmentosum variants, there is little information on the functions of these polymerases in vivo. here, we show that dna polymerase ι (polι), like polη, associates with the replication machinery and accumulates at stalled replication forks following dna‐damaging treatment. we show that polη and polι foci form with identical kinetics and spatial distributions, suggesting that localization of these two polymerases is tightly co‐ordinated within the nucleus. furthermore, localization of polι in replication foci is largely dependent on the presence of polη. using several different approaches, we demonstrate that polη and polι interact with each other physically and that the c‐terminal 224 amino acids of polι are sufficient for both the interaction with polη and accumulation in replication foci. our results provide strong evidence that polη targets polι to the replication machinery, where it may play a general role in maintaining genome integrity as well as participating in translesion dna synthesis.
excretion of urinary proteins as predictors of early posttransplantation complications and late renal allograft failure thirty episodes of histologically verified acute vascular rejection in kidney transplant recipients were studied. in 11 grafts the rejection was mainly vascular, whereas in 19 grafts a concomitant cellular rejection was seen. histological features prognostic for bad outcome were glomerular necrosis and thrombi in the arteries and arterioles. characteristic findings in transplant cytology, i.e., high number of monocytes and low number of lymphocytes and blast cells were noted prior to the onset of clinical signs of rejection, and this finding was also persisting throughout the rejection episode. the numbers of lymphocytes and blast cells were significantly lower in grafts with a pure vascular rejection than in grafts with a concomitant cellular rejection. vascular rejection was reversible in 15 cases. as rescue therapy plasmapheresis and added immunosuppression were often successful.
lissotriton vulgaris genetic dissimilarity predicts paternity in the smooth newt ( gene flow and drift shape the distribution of neutral genetic diversity in metapopulations, but their local rates are difficult to quantify. to identify gene flow between demes as distinct from individual migration, we present a modified bayesian method to genetically test for descendants between an immigrant and a resident in a nonmigratory life stage. applied to a metapopulation of pond‐breeding european newts (triturus cristatus, t. marmoratus) in western france, the evidence for gene flow was usually asymmetric and, for demes of known census size (n), translated into maximally seven reproducing immigrants. temporal sampling also enabled the joint estimation of the effective demic population size (ne) and the immigration rate m (including nonreproductive individuals). ne ranged between 4.1 and 19.3 individuals, ne/n ranged between 0.05 and 0.65 and always decreased with n; m was estimated as 0.19–0.63, and was possibly biased upwards. we discuss how genotypic data can reveal fine‐scale demographic processes with important microevolutionary implications.
localization and location verification in non-homogeneous one-dimensional wireless ad-hoc networks security plays an important role in the ability to deploy and retrieve trustworthy data from a wireless sensor network. location verification is an effective defense against attacks which take advantage of a lack, or compromise, of location information. in this work, a secure probabilistic location verification method for randomly deployed dense sensor networks is proposed. the proposed probabilistic location verification (plv) algorithm leverages the probabilistic dependence of the number of hops a broadcast packet traverses to reach a destination and the euclidean distance between the source and the destination. a small number of verifier nodes are used to determine the plausibility of the claimed location, which is represented by a real number between zero and one. using the calculated plausibility metric, it is possible to create arbitrary number of trust levels in the location claimed. simulation studies verify that the proposed solution provides high performance in face of various types of attacks.
the evolution of multiple haemoglobins in fishes the oxygenation-linked, allosteric interactions of erythrocytic organic phosphates and urea with the haemoglobin (hb), and the functional significance of the hb multiplicity, were studies in an elasmobranch, squalus acanthias. the autochthonous red cell nucleoside triphosphates (ntp) atp and gtp (guanosine triphosphate) strongly depress o2 affinity of the stripped (cofactor-free) hb and increase cooperativity in o2 binding. as previously found in teleost hbs, gtp exerts a greater effect than atp at the same concentration. urea, in contrast, increases o2 affinity and depresses cooperativity. it also antagonizes the modulator effectivity of ntp at physiological ntp/hb concentration ratios. deoxygenation of the hb raises blood ph. this haldane effect contrasts with earlier findings for pacific specimens, but accords with the presence of a bohr effect (phi = delta log p50/delta ph). s. acanthias hb resolves into six main components (three pairs) on the basis of isoelectric point. there is no evidence for radical functional differentiation as found in teleosts with electrophoretically anodal and cathodal hb components. the physiological implications of the findings and the possible molecular mechanisms basic to the ntp and urea effects are discussed.
a new locally weighted k-means for cancer-aided microarray data analysis motivation it is far from trivial to select the most effective clustering method and its parameterization, for a particular set of gene expression data, because there are a very large number of possibilities. although many researchers still prefer to use hierarchical clustering in one form or another, this is often sub-optimal. cluster ensemble research solves this problem by automatically combining multiple data partitions from different clusterings to improve both the robustness and quality of the clustering result. however, many existing ensemble techniques use an association matrix to summarize sample-cluster co-occurrence statistics, and relations within an ensemble are encapsulated only at coarse level, while those existing among clusters are completely neglected. discovering these missing associations may greatly extend the capability of the ensemble methodology for microarray data clustering.   results the link-based cluster ensemble (lce) method, presented here, implements these ideas and demonstrates outstanding performance. experiment results on real gene expression and synthetic datasets indicate that lce: (i) usually outperforms the existing cluster ensemble algorithms in individual tests and, overall, is clearly class-leading; (ii) generates excellent, robust performance across different types of data, especially with the presence of noise and imbalanced data clusters; (iii) provides a high-level data matrix that is applicable to many numerical clustering techniques; and (iv) is computationally efficient for large datasets and gene clustering.   availability online supplementary and implementation are available at: http://users.aber.ac.uk/nii07/bioinformatics2010.   supplementary information supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.
insights into milk-clotting activity of latex peptidases from calotropis procera and cryptostegia grandiflora. latex proteins have drawn attention because they have shown several pharmacological activities. herein, the fibrin(ogen)olytic activity of cryptostegia grandiflora (cglp) and plumeria rubra (prlp) latices were evaluated and characterized. ion-exchange chromatography separated cglp in proteolytic (cglp pi) and nonproteolytic proteins (cglp pii). cglp and cglp pi hydrolyzed azocasein in a dose-dependent manner, whereas cglp pii and prlp showed negligible activities. cglp and cglp pi accelerated plasmatic clot formation and digested all fibrinogen chains in a time/dose-dependent manner, though in a nonspecific way. cglp and cglp pi did not fully hydrolyze the subunits of the fibrin clot since fibrin &agr;-chain showed resistance to proteolysis. no fibrinogenolytic activity was noticed after incubation of cglp and cglp pi with e-64. these results suggested that fibrinogenolytic and procoagulant activities of c. grandiflora were performed by cysteine proteases and confirm the activity of latex cysteine proteases as thrombin and plasmin-like proteins.
role of microstructure on fracture of dentin. a methodology to determine the constitutive parameters for the simulation of progressive delamination is proposed. the procedure accounts for the size of a cohesive finite element and the length of the cohesive zone to ensure the correct dissipation of energy. in addition, a closed-form expression for estimating the minimum penalty stiffness necessary for the constitutive equation of a cohesive finite element is presented. it is shown that the resulting constitutive law allows the use of coarser finite element meshes than is usually admissible, which renders the analysis of large-scale progressive delamination problems computationally tractable.
oncogenic akap9-braf fusion is a novel mechanism of mapk pathway activation in thyroid cancer. the ntrk1 gene in the q arm of chromosome i encodes one of the receptors for the nerve growth factor and is frequently activated as an oncogene in papillary thyroid carcinomas. the activation is due to chromosomal rearrangements juxtaposing the ntrk1 tyrosine kinase domain to 5′‐end sequences from different genes. the thyroid trk oncogenes are activated by recombination with at least three different genes: the gene coding for tropomyosin and tpr, both on chromosome i, and tfg on chromosome 3. in a previous study, we showed that two tumors carrying the tpr/ntrk1 rearrangement contained structurally different oncogenes named trk‐t1 and trk‐t2. in this paper, we report (1) the cdna structure of trk‐t2. (2) evidence that trk‐t2 is generated by different rearrangements in two thyroid tumors, and (3) a detailed analysis of the three different tpr/ntrk1 rearrangements. with molecular studies based on southern blot hybridization, cloning, and sequencing, we show that all the rearrangements are nearly balanced, involving deletion, insertion, or duplication of only few nucleotides. in one case, an additional rearrangement involving sequences derived from chromosome 17 was detected. genes chromosom. cancer 19:112–123, 1997. © 1997 wiley‐liss, inc.
rapid and sustained response to tocilizumab, anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody, in a patient with nephrotic syndrome secondary to systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis-related amyloidosis constitutively overproduced in proliferating synovial tissues, interleukin-6 (il-6) is deeply involved in the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis (ra). tocilizumab is a humanized anti-human il-6 receptor antibody that binds to soluble and membrane-bound il-6 receptor, and at detectable levels in blood, tocilizumab is capable of almost completely blocking the transmembrane signaling of il-6. in clinical trials for patients with ra in japan, tocilizumab monotherapy has shown clinical efficacy equaling that of tumor necrosis factor (tnf) inhibitor in combination with methotrexate, and in an extension study in patients who responded to tocilizumab, almost no patients showed a decrease in the efficacy of tocilizumab. evidence obtained in a phase iii study in japan demonstrated that tocilizumab monotherapy had a sig-nificant inhibitory effect on the progression of structural joint damage compared with that of conventional disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (dmards). furthermore it has been shown that tocilizumab has an excellent ability to suppress serum amyloid a levels and could therefore be an important therapeutic strategy in amyloid a amyloidosis secondary to rheumatic diseases. the safety profile of tocilizumab appears to be satisfactory. however, several serious infections were also reported, and careful monitoring is therefore important during use.
ultrastructural, ssrdna sequencing of myxobolus prochilodus and myxobolus porofilus and details of the interaction with the host prochilodus lineatus myxozoans are among the most abundant parasites in nature. their life cycles involve two hosts: an invertebrate, usually an annelid, and a vertebrate, usually a fish. they affect fish species in their natural habitats but also constitute a menace for fish aquaculture. using different strategies they are able to parasitize and cause damage in multiple organs, including mucosal tissues, which they use also as portals of entry. in fish, the main mucosal sites include the intestine, skin and gills. recently the finding of a specific mucosal immunoglobulin in teleost (igt), analogous to mammalian iga, and the capacity of fish to develop a specific mucosal immune response against different pathogens, has highlighted the importance of studying immune responses at mucosal sites. in this review, we describe the major biological characteristics of myxozoan parasites and present the data available regarding immune responses for species that infect mucosal sites. as models for mucosal immunity we review the responses to enteromyxum spp. and ceratomyxa shasta, both of which parasitize the intestine. the immune response at the skin and gills is also described, as these mucosal tissues are used by myxozoans as attaching surfaces and portal of entry, and some species also parasitize these sites. finally, the development of immunoprophylactic strategies is discussed.
highly luminescent $a\hbox{-sio}_{\rm x} \langle \hbox{er} \rangle/\hbox{sio}_{2}/\hbox{si}$ multilayer structure we present a novel method for maximizing signal gain in continuously pumped silicon-waveguide raman amplifiers made with silicon-on-insulator technology. our method allows for pump-power depletion during raman amplification and makes use of a variational technique. its use leads to a system of four coupled nonlinear differential equations, whose numerical solution provides the optimal axial profile of the effective mode area along the waveguide length that maximizes the output signal power for a given amplifier length and a preset input (or output) cross-section area. in practice, the optimum profile can be realized by varying the cross-section area of a silicon waveguide along its length by tapering its width appropriately.
urbanization, ethnicity and cardiovascular risk in a population in transition in nakuru, kenya: a population-based survey although demography continues to be the most prominent discipline concerned with population dynamics, involvement of other disciplines is highly desirable. the case for a multidisciplinary approach to population theory has been aptly stated by kurt mayer: “any meaningful interpretation of the cause and effects of population changes must … extend beyond formal statistical measurement of the components of change, i.e. fertility, mortality and migration, and draw on the theoretical framework of several other disciplines for assistance (mayer 1962).” in noting that the “analysis of the causal determinants and consequences of population change forms the subject matter of population theory,” mayer inferentially acknowledges the epidemiologic character of population phenomena, for as its etymology indicates, (epi, upon; demos, people; logos, study), epidemiology is the study of what “comes upon” groups of people. more specifically, epidemiology is concerned with the distribution of disease and death, and with their determinants and consequences in population groups. inasmuch as patterns of health and disease are integral components of population change, epidemiology's reservoir of knowledge about these patterns and their determinants in population groups serves not only as a basis for prediction of population change but also as a source of hypotheses that can be further tested to correct, refine and build population theory. furthermore, many epidemiologic techniques that have heretofore been limited to the examination of health and disease patterns can be profitably applied as well to the exploration of other mass phenomena, such as fertility control.    a theory of epidemiologic transition, sensitive to the formulations of population theorists who have stressed the demographic, biologic, sociologic, economic and psychologic ramifications of transitional processes, was conceived by this author less than four years ago. recognition of the limitations of demographic transition theory and of the need for comprehensive approaches to population dynamics stimulated the development of this theory (van nort and karon 1955; micklin 1968).
laser therapy for onychomycosis: fact or fiction? it has always been difficult to treat onychomycosis due to decrease ability of topical agents to penetrate the nail and reach the affected nail bed. oral antifungal have shown good response but due to longer duration course it has potential to cause systemic side effects, leading to patient non‐adherence and adverse events. lasers, therefore, have been suggested for the treatment of onychomycosis due to their minimally invasive nature and the potential for requiring fewer treatment sessions. the aim of writing this article is to review a literature regarding treatment of onychomycosis by laser. this article will discuss about all the available laser treatment options for onychomycosis as well as their currently published, peer‐reviewed literature.
osteoprotegerin and denosumab stimulate human beta cell proliferation through inhibition of the receptor activator of nf-κb ligand pathway. abstract the cyclic amp (camp) signaling pathway is central in β-cell gene expression and function. in the nucleus, protein kinase a (pka) phosphorylates creb, resulting in recruitment of the transcriptional coactivators p300 and creb binding protein (cbp). cbp, but not p300, is phosphorylated at serine 436 in response to insulin action. cbp phosphorylation disrupts creb-cbp interaction and thus reduces nuclear camp action. to elucidate the importance of the camp-pka-creb-cbp pathway in pancreatic β cells specifically at the nuclear level, we have examined mutant mice lacking the insulin-dependent phosphorylation site of cbp. in these mice, the creb-cbp interaction is enhanced in both the absence and presence of camp stimulation. we found that islet and β-cell masses were increased twofold, while pancreas weights were not different from the weights of wild-type littermates. β-cell proliferation was increased both in vivo and in vitro in isolated islet cultures. surprisingly, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from perfused, isolated mutant islets was reduced. however, β-cell depolarization with kcl induced similar levels of insulin release from mutant and wild-type islets, indicating normal insulin synthesis and storage. in addition, transcripts of pgc1a, which disrupts glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, were also markedly elevated. in conclusion, sustained activation of cbp-responsive genes results in increased β-cell proliferation. in these β cells, however, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was diminished, resulting from concomitant creb-cbp-mediated pgc1a gene activation.
indoor human navigation systems: a survey in the research project navio (pedestrian navigation systems in combined indoor/outdoor environements) at our university we are working on the improvement of navigation services for pedestrians. thereby we are mainly focusing on the information aspect of location-based services, i.e., on the user’s task at hand and the support of the user’s decisions by information provided by such a service. specifications will allow us to select appropriate sensor data and to integrate data when and where needed, to propose context-dependent routes fitting to partly conflicting interests and goals as well as to select appropriate communication methods in terms of supporting the user guidance by various multimedia cartography forms. these taks are addressed in the project in three different work packages, i.e., the first on “integrated positioning”, the second on “pedestrian route modeling” and the third on “multimedia route communication”. in this paper we will concentrate on the research work and findings in the first work package. for continuous positioning of a pedestrian suitable location technologies include gnss and indoor location techniques, cellular phone positioning, dead reckoning sensors (e.g. magnetic compass, gyro and accelerometers) for measurement of heading and travelled distance as well as barometric pressure sensors for height determination. the integration of these sensors in a modern multi-sensor system can be performed using an adapted kalman filter. to test and to demonstrate our approach, we take a use case scenario into account, i.e., the guidance of visitors to departments of the vienna university of technology. the results of simulation studies and practical tests could confirm that such a service can achieve a high level of performance for the guidance of a pedestrian in urban areas and mixed indoor and outdoor environments.
in vitro and in vivo evaluation of novel cross-linked saccharide based polymers as bile acid sequestrants beta-cyclodextrin is a compound that forms inclusion complexes with a variety of molecules, specially bile acids and sterols. this study examines the effects of beta-cyclodextrin on cholesterol and bile acid metabolism in hypercholesterolaemic rats. male wistar rats were divided into 4 groups that received during 7 weeks: control diet, 2% cholesterol diet (a), a+2.5% beta-cyclodextrin (b) and a+5% beta-cyclodextrin (c). the cholesterol-rich diet induced hepatomegaly and fatty liver and significantly reduced cholesterol, bile acid and phospholipid secretion. addition of beta-cyclodextrin normalised biliary lipid secretion. moreover, when compared to a, beta-cyclodextrin significantly lowered plasma phospholipid concentration (b: -21%; c: -29%) and the liver free/total cholesterol molar ratio (b: -40%; c: -38%), increased bile acid faecal output (b: +17%; c: +62%) and enhanced cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase activity (b:+50%; c : +100%)and mrna levels (b: + 14%; c: +29%). 5% beta-cyclodextrin also reduced plasma triglycerides concentration (-38%). however, alt and ast activities were significantly increased (b: +140% and +280%; c: +72% and +135%) and there was a high incidence of cell necrosis with portal inflammatory cell infiltration. addition of beta-cyclodextrin to a cholesterol-rich diet results in a triglyceride-lowering action, enhancement of bile acid synthesis and excretion, and normalization of biliary lipid secretion, but produces a marked hepatotoxic effect.
estrogens and ici182,780 (faslodex) modulate mitosis and cell death in immature cerebellar neurons via rapid activation of p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase cell death is generally classified into two large categories: apoptosis represents active, programmed cell death, while necrosis represents passive cell death without underlying regulatory mechanisms. recent progress revealed that caspases, a family of cysteine proteases, play a central role in the regulation of apoptosis. unexpectedly, however, caspase inhibition occasionally turns the morphology of programmed cell death from apoptotic into necrotic without inhibiting death itself. in this article, we review different models of caspase-independent programmed cell death showing necrotic-like morphology, including our ras-mediated caspase-independent cell death. based on these findings, we suggest the existence of a necrotic-like cell death regulated by cellular intrinsic death programs distinct from that of apoptosis. even though type 2 physiological cell death, or autophagic degeneration, has been recognized as a necrotic-like programmed cell death for a long time, the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been identified despite its physiological significance. this has been in part due to the previous absence of adequate caspase-independent cellular models to study, recent efforts may now help to elucidate these mechanisms.
historical population demography of red snapper (lutjanus campechanus) from the northern gulf of mexico based on analysis of sequences of mitochondrial dna since the 1920s, population geneticists have had measures that describe how genetic variation is distributed spatially within a species’ geographical range. modern genetic survey techniques frequently yield information on the evolutionary relationships among the alleles or haplotypes as well as information on allele frequencies and their spatial distributions. this evolutionary information is often expressed in the form of an estimated haplotype or allele tree. traditional statistics of population structure, such as f statistics, do not make use of evolutionary genealogical information, so it is necessary to develop new statistical estimators and tests that explicitly incorporate information from the haplotype tree. one such technique is to use the haplotype tree to define a nested series of branches (clades), thereby allowing an evolutionary nested analysis of the spatial distribution of genetic variation. such a nested analysis can be performed regarding the geographical sampling locations either as categorical or continuous variables (i.e. some measure of spatial distance). it is shown that such nested phylogeographical analyses have more power to detect geographical associations than traditional, nonhistorical analyses and, as a consequence, allow a broader range of gene‐flow parameters to be estimated in a precise fashion. more importantly, such nested analyses can discriminate between phylogeographical associations due to recurrent but restricted gene flow vs. historical events operating at the population level (e.g. past fragmentation, colonization, or range expansion events). restricted gene flow and historical events can be intertwined, and the cladistic analyses can reconstruct their temporal juxtapositions, thereby yielding great insight into both the evolutionary history and population structure of the species. examples are given that illustrate these properties, concentrating on the detection of range expansion events.
endogenous swimming rhythms underlying the spawning migration of the blue crab, callinectes sapidus: ontogeny and variation with ambient tidal regime abstract ovigerous blue crabs, callinectes sapidus rathbun, undergo ebb-tide transport (ett) during the spawning migration from estuaries to coastal areas where they release larvae. an initial field study found that only females with mature embryos underwent the spawning migration and that postspawned females switched to flood-tide transport for movement back into and up estuaries. alternatively, a more recent field study found ett occurred in females throughout embryo development and continued after larval release. an endogenous rhythm in vertical migration underlies ett during the spawning migration. a past study found the circatidal rhythm was only present in females with mature embryos but not in females with immature embryos or after larval release. the present study reinvestigates this rhythm in vertical migration. both females with early embryos and postlarval release females entrained in the field have circatidal rhythms, in which they swim vertically at the time of consecutive ebb tides at the collection site or on alternate ebb tides. these results support the field study that ovigerous females undergo ett throughout embryo development and after larval release. thus, females will be transported seaward and release subsequent larval clutches in coastal areas that increase the likelihood that larvae will be transported to offshore developmental areas.
efficient and secure network services in wireless sensor networks making effective use of the vast amounts of data gathered by large-scale sensor networks will require scalable, self-organizing, and energy-efficient data dissemination algorithms. previous work has identified data-centric routing as one such method. in an asso-ciated position paper [23], we argue that a companion method, data-centric storage (dcs), is also a useful approach. under dcs, sensed data are stored at a node determined by the name associated with the sensed data. in this paper, we describe ght, a geographic hash table system for dcs on sensornets. ght hashes keys into geographic coordi-nates, and stores a key-value pair at the sensor node geographically nearest the hash of its key. the system replicates stored data lo-cally to ensure persistence when nodes fail. it uses an efficient consistency protocol to ensure that key-value pairs are stored at the appropriate nodes after topological changes. and it distributes load throughout the network using a geographic hierarchy. we evaluate the performance of ght as a dcs system in simulation against two other dissemination approaches. our results demonstrate that ght is the preferable approach for the application workloads predicted in [23], offers high data availability, and scales to large sensornet deployments, even when nodes fail or are mobile.
neuroenhancement by noninvasive brain stimulation is not a net zero-sum proposition here we review the usefulness of transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms) in modulating cortical networks in ways that might produce performance enhancements in healthy human subjects. to date over sixty studies have reported significant improvements in speed and accuracy in a variety of tasks involving perceptual, motor, and executive processing. two basic categories of enhancement mechanisms are suggested by this literature: direct modulation of a cortical region or network that leads to more efficient processing, and addition-by-subtraction, which is disruption of processing which competes or distracts from task performance. potential applications of tms cognitive enhancement, including research into cortical function, rehabilitation therapy in neurological and psychiatric illness, and accelerated skill acquisition in healthy individuals are discussed, as are methods of optimizing the magnitude and duration of tms-induced performance enhancement, such as improvement of targeting through further integration of brain imaging with tms. one technique, combining multiple sessions of tms with concurrent tms/task performance to induce hebbian-like learning, appears to be promising for prolonging enhancement effects. while further refinements in the application of tms to cognitive enhancement can still be made, and questions remain regarding the mechanisms underlying the observed effects, this appears to be a fruitful area of investigation that may shed light on the basic mechanisms of cognitive function and their therapeutic modulation.
does extended lymph node dissection affect the lymph node density and survival after radical cystectomy? purpose to our knowledge the extent of lymphadenectomy with cystectomy, the number of lymph nodes to be retrieved and the anatomical groups to be dissected are still undetermined. this study was done to clarify these issues.   materials and methods a total of 200 patients underwent radical cystectomy and extended lymphadenectomy up to the level of origin of the inferior mesenteric artery. removed tissues were labeled according to anatomical location and sent separately for pathological evaluation. in each group the number and status of lymph nodes were determined. the number of positive nodes was correlated with the number of retrieved nodes. cases with a single positive node were identified and the anatomical location was defined.   results the mean number of retrieved nodes per patient +/- se was 50.6 +/- 14.4 and 48 (24%) patients had nodal disease. the mean number of positive nodes per involved case was 8.08 +/- 13.2. there was a weak correlation between the number of positive nodes and the number of harvested nodes. bilateral disease was noted in 39.6% of cases. single node involvement was observed in 22 cases, of which all except 1 were in the endopelvic region.   conclusions there is a sentinel region, which is the endopelvic region (that is the internal iliac and obturator groups of lymph nodes). there are no skipped lesions. negative nodes in the endopelvic region indicate that more proximal dissection is not necessary. bilateral endopelvic dissection is mandatory.
reactive nitrogen species contribute to innate host defense against campylobacter jejuni abstract salmonella enterica serovars typhimurium and dublin lysed primary bovine alveolar macrophages and immortalized j774.2 macrophage-like cells in the absence of either the morphological changes or dna fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis. macrophage lysis was dependent on a subset of caspases and an intactsipb gene.
human bcas3 expression in embryonic stem cells and vascular precursors suggests a role in human embryogenesis and tumor angiogenesis desmoplastic medulloblastoma (dmb) is a malignant cerebellar tumour composed of two distinct tissue components, pale islands and desmoplastic areas. previous studies revealed mutations in genes encoding members of the sonic hedgehog pathway, including ptch, smoh and sufuh in dmbs. however, little is known about other genomic aberrations. we performed comparative genomic hybridization (cgh) analysis of 22 sporadic dmbs and identified chromosomal imbalances in 20 tumours (91%; mean, 4.9 imbalances/tumour). recurrent chromosomal gains were found on chromosomes 3, 9 (six tumours each), 20, 22 (five tumours each), 2, 6, 7, 17 (four tumours each) and 1 (three tumours). recurrent losses involved chromosomes x (eight tumours), y (six of eleven tumours from male patients), 9, 12 (four tumours each), as well as 10, 13 and 17 (three tumours each). four tumours demonstrated high‐level amplifications involving sequences from 1p22, 5p15, 9p, 12p13, 13q33‐q34 and 17q22‐q24, respectively. further analysis of the 9p and 17q22‐q24 amplicons by array‐based cgh (matrix‐cgh) and candidate gene analyses revealed amplification of jmjd2c at 9p24 in one dmb and amplification of rps6kb1, appbp2, ppm1d and bcas3 from 17q23 in three dmbs. among the 17q23 genes, rps6kb1 showed markedly elevated transcript levels as compared to normal cerebellum in five of six dmbs and four of five classic medulloblastomas investigated. finally, cgh analysis of microdissected pale islands and desmoplastic areas showed common chromosomal imbalances in five of six informative tumours. in summary, we have identified several novel genetic alterations in dmbs and provide genetic evidence for a monoclonal origin of their different tissue components. copyright © 2006 pathological society of great britain and ireland. published by john wiley & sons, ltd.
evaluation of pulmonary embolism in a pediatric population with high clinical suspicion summary.  venous thromboembolic (vte) events are being increasingly diagnosed in systemic and cerebral vessels in children. systemic vte are increasing in children as a result of therapeutic advances and improved clinical acumen in primary illnesses that previously caused mortality. the epidemiology of systemic vte has been studied in international registries. in children older than 3 months, teenagers are the largest group developing vte. the most common etiologic factor is the presence of central venous lines. clinical studies have determined the most sensitive diagnostic method for diagnosing upper system vte are ultrasound for jugular venous thrombosis and venography for intrathoracic vessels. however, the most sensitive diagnostic methods for lower system vte and pulmonary embolism (pe) have not been established. treatment studies for vte consist of inadequately powered randomized controlled trials or prospective cohort studies. the long‐term outcome of systemic vte, post‐thrombotic syndrome, has been reported in children. cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (csvt) is becoming increasingly diagnosed in children due to the recognition of the associated subtle clinical symptoms and improved cerebrovascular imaging. the etiology of csvt includes thrombophilia, head and neck infections, and systemic illness. estimates of the incidence and outcome of childhood csvt have recently become available through the canadian pediatric ischaemic stroke registry. clinical studies have not yet been carried out in children to determine the best method of diagnosis or treatment. there have only been case‐series studies carried out in the treatment of csvt. properly designed clinical trials are urgently required in children with systemic vte/pe and csvt to define the best methods of diagnosis, treatment and long‐term management.
fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) analysis of primary ocular adnexal malt lymphoma we performed a prospective multiparametric correlative clinical, histopathologic, and immunologic analysis of 117 ocular adnexal lymphoid proliferations developing in 108 patients between october 1977 and july 1987. the ocular adnexal lymphoid proliferations were distributed among the 108 patients as follows: orbit 69 (64%), conjunctiva 30 (28%), and eyelids nine (8%). the 117 ocular adnexal lymphoid proliferations were classified as follows: polyclonal lymphoid hyperplasia, 32 (22 orbit, nine conjunctiva, one eyelid) (27%); monoclonal b cell lymphoma, 81 (48 orbit, 25 conjunctiva, eight eyelid) (69%); null cell lymphoma, one (orbit) (1%); and histologically indeterminate, three (one each: orbit, conjunctiva, eyelid) (3%). patients presenting with ocular adnexal polyclonal lymphoid hyperplasia and monoclonal b cell lymphoma, and patients developing unilateral and bilateral ocular adnexal lymphoid proliferations did not differ significantly with respect to age, sex, presenting complaints, duration of symptoms, or ophthalmic findings. classifying ocular adnexal lymphoid proliferations into benign and malignant categories by histopathologic criteria and into polyclonal and monoclonal b cell categories by immunophenotypic criteria was not useful in predicting eventual outcome, including the occurrence of extraocular lymphoma. however, the clinicopathologic characteristics did differ according to the anatomic site of involvement and histopathology of the ocular adnexal lymphoid proliferations. lymphoid infiltrates of the conjunctiva were associated with a lower incidence of extra-ocular lymphoma (20%) than were those of the orbit and eyelid, 35% and 67%, respectively (statistically significant, p less than .03). ocular adnexal small lymphocytic and intermediate lymphocytic lymphomas were less often associated with extra-ocular lymphoma than were ocular adnexal lymphomas of all other histologic types, 27% and 46%, respectively (p less than .09). however, the single most important and statistically significant prognostic factor in these patients was the extent of disease at the time of presentation with an ocular adnexal lymphoid proliferation (p less than .001). eighty-six percent of patients presenting with a unilateral or bilateral clinical stage le ocular adnexal lymphoid proliferation, regardless of the histopathology or the immunophenotype, had a benign indolent clinical course and failed to develop ocular or extra-ocular lymphoma during a median follow-up period of 51 months. the results of this study substantially improve our understanding of extranodal small lymphocytic proliferations in general, and those of the ocular adnexa in particular.
is toxoplasma gondii infection a risk factor for leukemia? an evidence-based meta-analysis toxoplasma gondii is a worldwide prevalent pathogen that infects most of the warm-blood vertebrates. to investigate the regulation network of splenic mirnas altered by acute infection with t. gondii, we herein investigated the changes of mirna profile in mouse spleen via next generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. a total of 379 mirnas was identified, 131 mirnas of them were differentially expressed (including 97 upregulated and 34 downregulated mirnas). 48 differentially expressed mirnas had validated targets in the mirwalk2.0 database. gene ontology (go) enrichment analysis revealed that the validated targets of differently expressed mirnas were significantly enriched in gene transcription regulation. it suggested that t. gondii can modulate host gene expression through targeting to trans-regulation factors. the genes involved in apoptosis or anti-apoptosis were both targeted by differentially expressed mirnas. the change of power balance between the mirnas targeting host apoptosis genes and those regulating host anti-apoptosis genes contributes to the fate of host apoptosis process. twelve pathways were significantly enriched in kegg analysis with most of them being cancer related, including pathways in cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, axon guidance, mapk signaling pathway, focal adhesion, chronic myeloid leukemia, renal cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, glioma, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, and wnt signaling pathway. our study showed a changed mirna regulation network in mouse spleen infected by t. gondii. these findings will be helpful for better understanding of mirna regulation network in host-t. gondii interaction, revealing the relationship among t. gondii infection, gene regulation, apoptosis and cancer process alterations in infected spleen.
daytime cardiac repolarization in patients with obstructive sleep apnea background—whenever a proband is identified with long-qt syndrome (lqts), his or her parents and siblings should be evaluated regarding the possibility of carrying the disorder. in the majority of cases, one of the proband’s parents and one or more siblings are affected. the aim of this study was (1) to determine whether the clinical severity of lqts in the proband is useful in identifying first-degree family members at high risk for cardiac events, and (2) to evaluate the clinical course of affected parents and siblings of lqts probands. methods and results—the clinical and ecg characteristics of 211 lqts probands and 791 first-degree relatives (422 parents and 369 siblings) were studied to determine if the clinical profile of the proband is useful in determining the clinical severity of lqts in affected parents and siblings. affected female parents of an lqts proband had a greater cumulative risk for a first cardiac event than affected male parents. the probability of a parent or sibling having a first cardiac event was not significantly influenced by the severity of the proband’s clinical symptoms. female sex and qtc duration were risk factors for cardiac events among affected parents, and qtc was the only risk factor for cardiac events in affected siblings. conclusions—the severity profile of lqts in a proband was not found to be useful in identifying the clinical severity of lqts in affected first-degree relatives of the proband.
consumption of acidic water alters the gut microbiome and decreases the risk of diabetes in nod mice the gastrointestinal tract of mammals is inhabited by hundreds of distinct species of commensal microorganisms that exist in a mutualistic relationship with the host. how commensal microbiota influence the host immune system is poorly understood. we show here that colonization of the small intestine of mice with a single commensal microbe, segmented filamentous bacterium (sfb), is sufficient to induce the appearance of cd4(+) t helper cells that produce il-17 and il-22 (th17 cells) in the lamina propria. sfb adhere tightly to the surface of epithelial cells in the terminal ileum of mice with th17 cells but are absent from mice that have few th17 cells. colonization with sfb was correlated with increased expression of genes associated with inflammation and antimicrobial defenses and resulted in enhanced resistance to the intestinal pathogen citrobacter rodentium. thus, manipulation of this commensal-regulated pathway may provide new opportunities for enhancing mucosal immunity and treating autoimmune disease.
metabolic risk markers in women with polycystic ovarian morphology objective the rotterdam criteria extend the phenotypic spectrum of polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos). we characterized endocrine and metabolic differences among women meeting the national institutes of health (nih) definition for pcos vs two novel phenotypes established by the european society of human reproduction and embryology/american society for reproductive medicine definition.   study design endocrine and metabolic data from a retrospective analysis of 160 age- and weight-matched women with pcos and 23 controls were compared. insulin sensitivity indices were correlated with androgens, gonadotropins, and lipids within each phenotype.   results ovarian and adrenal androgens were highest in the nih-defined pcos group, lowest in the nonhyperandrogenic pcos group, and intermediate in the hyperandrogenic ovulatory pcos population. insulin sensitivity indices, gonadotropins, and lipids were similar across all pcos phenotypes. the magnitude of insulin resistance correlated with free testosterone only in the nih-defined group.   conclusion androgen levels are the major distinguishing endocrine feature differentiating phenotypic expressions of pcos. hyperinsulinemia correlates with free testosterone levels only in traditional nih-defined women with pcos.
ubiquitous associations and a peak fall prevalence between apicomplexan symbionts and reef corals in florida and the bahamas this report documents the extent to which coral colonies show fluctuations in their associations with different endosymbiotic dinoflagellates. the genetic identity of symbiodinium from six coral species [acropora palmata (lamarck), a. cervicornis (lamarck), siderastrea siderea (ellis and solander), montastrea faveolata (ellis and solander), m. annularis (ellis and solander), and m. franksi (gregory)] was examined seasonally over five years (1998 and 2000–2004) in the bahamas and florida keys at shallow (1 to 4 m) fore-reef/patch reef sites and at deeper fore-reef (12–15 m) locations. symbionts were identified genetically using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) fingerprinting of the internal transcribed spacer region 2 (its2) of ribosomal rna gene loci. repetitive sampling from most labeled colonies from the bahamas and the florida keys showed little to no change in their dominant symbiont. in contrast, certain colonies of m. annularis and m. franksi from the florida keys exhibited shifts in their associations attributed to recovery from the stresses of the 1997–1998 el niño southern oscillation (enso) event. over several years, a putatively stress-tolerant clade d type of symbiodinium was progressively replaced in these colonies by symbionts typically found in m. annularis and m. franksi in florida and at other caribbean locations. greater environmental fluctuations in florida may explain the observed changes among some of the symbioses. furthermore, symbiotic associations were more heterogeneous at shallow sites, relative to deep sites. the exposure to greater environmental variability near the surface may explain the higher symbiont diversity found within and between host colonies.
cyclin‐dependent kinase‐dependent phosphorylation of lif1 and sae2 controls imprecise nonhomologous end joining accompanied by double‐strand break resection the mre11 complex functions in double-strand break (dsb) repair, meiotic recombination, and dna damage checkpoint pathways. sae2 deficiency has opposing effects on the mre11 complex. on one hand, it appears to impair mre11 nuclease function in dna repair and meiotic dsb processing, and on the other, sae2 deficiency activates mre11-complex-dependent dna-damage-signaling via the tel1–mre11 complex (tm) pathway. we demonstrate that sae2 overexpression blocks the tm pathway, suggesting that sae2 antagonizes mre11-complex checkpoint functions. to understand how sae2 regulates the mre11 complex, we screened for sae2 alleles that behaved as the null with respect to mre11-complex checkpoint functions, but left nuclease function intact. phenotypic characterization of these sae2 alleles suggests that sae2 functions as a multimer and influences the substrate specificity of the mre11 nuclease. we show that sae2 oligomerizes independently of dna damage and that oligomerization is required for its regulatory influence on the mre11 nuclease and checkpoint functions.
nod2 signaling contributes to host defense in the lungs against escherichia coli infection staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of community-acquired and nosocomial infections including the life-threatening conditions endocarditis, necrotizing pneumonia, necrotizing fasciitis, and septicemia. toll-like receptor (tlr)-2, a membrane-bound microbial sensor, detects staphylococcal components, but macrophages lacking tlr2 or both tlr2 and tlr4 remain s. aureus responsive, suggesting that an alternative microbial recognition receptor might be involved. the cytoplasmic sensor nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing (nod) 2/caspase recruitment domain (card) 15 detects muramyl dipeptide from bacterial peptidoglycans and mediates cytokine responses to s. aureus in vitro, but the physiological significance of these observations is not well defined. here we show that nod2-deficient mice exhibit a delayed but ultimately exacerbated ulcerative response and impaired bacterial clearance after s.c. infection with s. aureus. nod2-dependent recognition of s. aureus and muramyl dipeptide is facilitated by α-toxin (α-hemolysin), a pore-forming toxin and virulence factor of the pathogen. the action of nod2 is dependent on il-1β-amplified production of il-6, which promotes rapid bacterial killing by neutrophils. these results significantly broaden the physiological importance of nod2 in innate immunity from the recognition of bacteria that primarily enter the cytoplasm to the detection of bacteria that typically reside extracellularly and demonstrate that this microbial sensor contributes to the discrimination between commensal bacteria and bacterial pathogens that elaborate pore-forming toxins.
a category-based equational logic semantics to constraint programming equational deduction is generalised within a category-based abstract model theory framework, and proved complete under a hypothesis of quantifier projectivity, using a semantic treatment that regards quantifiers as models rather than variables, and valuations as model morphisms rather than functions. applications include many- and order-sorted (conditional) equational logics, horn clause logic, equational deduction modulo a theory, constraint logics, and more, as well as any possible combination among them. in the cases of equational deduction modulo a theory and of constraint logic the completeness result is new. one important consequence is an abstract version of herbrand's theorem, which provides an abstract model theoretic foundation for equational and constraint logic programming.
lipopolysaccharide stress induces cell-type specific production of murine leukemia virus type-endogenous retroviral virions in primary lymphoid cells we have determined the 8,332-nucleotide structure of the genome of moloney murine leukaemia virus. the coding frame for the gag gene is the same as that for pol, separated only by a single amber triplet. the pol gene encodes 132,000 daltons of protein, larger than the 70,000 daltons required for the reverse transcriptase. the env gene overlaps the pol gene.
kinematic and temporospatial assessment of habituation of labrador retrievers to treadmill trotting. the current state of canine kinetic and kinematic gait analysis, as developed for the objective description of movement for the study of musculoskeletal disease and lameness, is reviewed. basic terminology of gait is discussed. ground reaction forces, dynamic flexion, and extension angles and angular velocities are described for the canine walk and trot and for lameness in cranial cruciate ligament rupture and canine hip dysplasia.
omega-3 fatty acid levels in red blood cell membranes and physical decline over 3 years: longitudinal data from the mapt study the effects of manipulating dietary levels of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids on the function of isolated skeletal muscles in male wistar rats were examined. three isoenergetic diets were used: an essential fatty acid-deficient diet (efad), a diet high in essential (n-6) fatty acids [high (n-6)], and a diet enriched with essential (n-3) fatty acids [high (n-3)]. after 9 wk, groups of rats on each test diet were fed a stock diet of laboratory chow for a further 6 wk. muscle function was examined by using a battery of five tests for soleus (slow twitch) and extensor digitorum longus (edl; fast twitch). tests included single muscle twitches, sustained tetanic contractions, posttetanic potentiation, sustained high-frequency stimulation, and intermittent low-frequency stimulation. results for muscles from the high (n-6) and high (n-3) groups were very similar. however, the efad diet resulted in significantly lower muscular tensions and reduced response times compared with the high (n-6) and high (n-3) diets. peak twitch tension in soleus muscles was 16-21% less in the efad group than in the high (n-6) and high (n-3) groups, respectively [analysis of variance (anova), p < 0.01). during high-frequency stimulation, edl muscles from the efad rats fatigued 32% more quickly (anova, p < 0.01)]. also, twitch contraction and half-relaxation times were significantly 5-7% reduced in the efad group (anova, p < 0.01). during intermittent low-frequency stimulation, soleus muscles from the efad group generated 25-28% less tension than did the other groups (anova, p < 0.01), but in edl muscles from the efad group, endurance was 20% greater than in the high (n-6) group (anova, p < 0.05). after 6 wk on the stock diet, there were no longer any differences between the dietary groups. manipulation of dietary fatty acids results in significant, but reversible, effects in muscles of rats fed an efad diet.
brain hypoxanthine concentration correlates to lactate/pyruvate ratio but not intracranial pressure in patients with acute liver failure. aimhyperammonemia causes brain edema and high intracranial pressure (icp) in acute liver failure (alf) by accumulation of glutamine in brain. since a high-level glutamine may compromise mitochondrial function, the aim of this study was to determine if the lactate–pyruvate ratio is associated with a rise in the glutamine concentration and icp.patients and methodsin 13 patients with alf (8f/5m; median age 46 (range 18–66) years) the cerebral extracellular concentrations of glutamine, lactate, and pyruvate were measured by in vivo brain microdialysis together with icp and cerebral perfusion pressure (cpp).resultsthe cerebral glutamine concentration was 4,396 (1,011–9,712) μm, lactate 2.15 (1.1–4.45) mm, and pyruvate 101 (43–255) μm. the lactate–pyruvate ratio was 21 (16–40), icp 20 (2–28) mmhg, and cpp 72 (56–115) mmhg. cerebral glutamine concentration correlated with the lactate–pyruvate ratio (r = 0.89, p < 0.05). also the icp, but not cpp, correlated to the lactate–pyruvate ratio (r = 0.64, p < 0.05).conclusionicp and the cerebral glutamine concentration in patients with alf correlate to the lactate–pyruvate ratio. since cpp was sufficient in all patients the rise in lactate–pyruvate ratio indicates that accumulation of glutamine compromises mitochondrial function and causes intracranial hypertension.
reactive oxygen species and oxidative dna damage mediate the cytotoxicity of tungsten-nickel-cobalt alloys in vitro. caspases, a family of cysteine proteases most often investigated for their roles in apoptosis, have also been demonstrated to have functions that are vital for the efficient execution of cell differentiation. one such role that has been described is the requirement of caspase-3 for the differentiation of skeletal myoblasts into myotubes but, as yet, the mechanism leading to caspase-3 activation in this case remains elusive. here, we demonstrate that caspase-9, an initiator caspase in the mitochondrial death pathway, is responsible for the activation of caspase-3 in differentiating c2c12 cells. reduction of caspase-9 levels, using an shrna construct, prevented caspase-3 activation and inhibited myoblast fusion. myosin-heavy-chain expression, which accompanies myoblastic differentiation, was not caspase-dependent. overexpression of bcl-xl, a protein that inhibits caspase-9 activation, had the same effect on muscle differentiation as knockdown of caspase-9. these data suggest that the mitochondrial pathway is required for differentiation; however, the release of cytochrome c or smac (diablo) could not be detected, raising the possibility of a novel mechanism of caspase-9 activation during muscle differentiation.
reflective and formative metrics of relationship value: a commentary essay during the last years cooperative buyer-seller relationships in industrial markets were more and more discovered as instruments of strategy. while quite a number of publications emphasize the role of the concept of relationship value for the management of cooperative buyer-seller relationships, only very limited empirical research has been done on this topic so far. therefore, this paper describes a large-scale, three-step empirical study that is aimed at conceptualizing and measuring the value of cooperative business relationships from both buyer and supplier perspective using methods of multivariate analysis. results show that benefits and sacrifice may be considered as building blocks of relationship value, with relationship benefits being the main value drivers.
stabilizing exposure of conserved epitopes by structure guided insertion of disulfide bond in hiv-1 envelope glycoprotein abstract the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 exterior gp120 envelope glycoprotein is highly flexible, and this flexibility may contribute to the inability of monomeric gp120 immunogens to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies. we previously showed that an s375w modification of a critical interfacial cavity central to the primary receptor binding site, the phe43 cavity, stabilizes gp120 into the cd4-bound state. however, the immunological effects of this cavity-altering replacement were never tested. subsequently, we screened other mutations that, along with the s375w alteration, might further stabilize the cd4-bound state. here, we define a selected second cavity-altering replacement, t257s, and analyze the double mutations in several gp120 envelope glycoprotein contexts. the gp120 glycoproteins with the t257s-plus-s375w double mutation (t257s+s375w) have a superior antigenic profile compared to the originally identified single s375w replacement in terms of enhanced recognition by the broadly neutralizing cd4 binding-site antibody b12. isothermal titration calorimetry measuring the entropy of the gp120 interaction with cd4 indicated that the double mutant was also stabilized into the cd4-bound state, with increasing relative fixation between core, full-length monomeric, and full-length trimeric versions of gp120. a significant increase in gp120 affinity for cd4 was also observed for the cavity-filling mutants relative to wild-type gp120. the most conformationally constrained t257s+s375w trimeric gp120 proteins were selected for immunogenicity analysis in rabbits and displayed a trend of improvement relative to their wild-type counterparts in terms of eliciting neutralizing antibodies. together, the results suggest that conformational stabilization may improve the ability of gp120 to elicit neutralizing antibodies.

metabolic responses to oral tryptophan supplementation before exercise in horses. it has been hypothesized that fatigue and prolactin (prl) changes during endurance exercise are influenced by serotonin synthesis, and in turn, release. such a change is thought to occur through an increase in blood free tryptophan (trp) and a concomitant decrease in those large neutral amino acids (lnaa) which compete with free trp for entry into the brain. for further investigation, 10 healthy athletes were randomly subjected to three test units (tu), each consisting of a treadmill run for 90 min. the speed was adjusted to a blood lactate level of 2 mmol/l. during the first 30 min of exercise infusions of 500 ml saline (tu i), 500 ml saline with amino acids (tu ii) or 500 ml saline with 30 u heparin/kg following an oral soy oil solution given 1 h before (tu iii) were administered. rate of perceived exertion (rpe), heart rate and running speed were recorded during exercise. venous blood samples were taken after a 10 h fast, at rest, after 10, 50 and 90 min of exercise as well as 10 and 30 min post-exercise. prl, insulin, glucose, ammonia, lactate, triglycerides (tg), free fatty acids (ffa) and amino acids were determined in each sample. no significant differences were found in rpe. prl increased (p < 0.01) in all tu. tg and heparin administration resulted in an increase (p <0.01) in ffa, which correlated (p < 0.01) with free trp and the ratio of free trp/trp. artificial increase in free trp in tu iii did not affect plasma prl level. the amino acid infusion in tu ii induced an increase in lnaa but had no significant effect on prl. prl and ammonia peaked at the end of exercise. we conclude that neither exercise-induced prl secretion nor rpe are affected by changes in circulating free trp and lnaa under the present conditions.
pathway shifts and thermal softening in temperature-coupled forced unfolding of spectrin domains. using a modified atomic force microscope (afm), individual double-stranded (ds) dna molecules attached to an afm tip and a gold surface were overstretched, and the mechanical stability of the dna double helix was investigated. in lambda-phage dna the previously reported b-s transition at 65 piconewtons (pn) is followed by a second conformational transition, during which the dna double helix melts into two single strands. unlike the b-s transition, the melting transition exhibits a pronounced force-loading-rate dependence and a marked hysteresis, characteristic of a nonequilibrium conformational transition. the kinetics of force-induced melting of the double helix, its reannealing kinetics, as well as the influence of ionic strength, temperature, and dna sequence on the mechanical stability of the double helix were investigated. as expected, the dna double helix is considerably destabilized under low salt buffer conditions (</=10 mm nacl), while high ionic strength buffers (1 m nacl) stabilize the double-helical conformation. the mechanical energy that can be deposited in the dna double helix before force induced melting occurs was found to decrease with increasing temperature. this energy correlates with the base-pairing free enthalpy deltag(bp)(t) of dna. experiments with pure poly(dg-dc) and poly(da-dt) dna sequences again revealed a close correlation between the mechanical energies at which these sequences melt with base pairing free enthalpies deltag(bp)(sequence): while the melting transition occurs between 65 and 200 pn in lambda-phage dna, depending on the loading rate, the melting transition is shifted to approximately 300 pn for poly(dg-dc) dna, whereas poly(da-dt) dna melts at a force of 35 pn.
effect of moringa oleifera lam. seed extract on toluene diisocyanate-induced immune-mediated inflammatory responses in rats diisocyanates are highly reactive compounds widely used, for example, in the production of polyure-thane foams, elastomers, paints, and adhesives. the high chemical reactivity of these compounds is also reflected in their toxicity: diisocyanates are one of the most important causes of occupational asthma but also other adverse effects, such as irritation and toxic reactions, have been described in exposed subjects. one of the open questions is whether occupational isocyanate exposure is a carcinogenic hazard. the few epidemiological studies available have been based on young cohorts and short follow-up and are not conclusive. toluene diisocyanate (tdi) has been classified as carcinogenic in animals on the basis of gavage administration studies, but no conclusions are available on inhalation exposure. for 4,4′-methylene diphenyldiisocyanate (mdi) there is suggestive evidence for carcinoge-nicity in rats. the possible carcinogenic mechanism of tdi and mdi is not clear. both chemicals have been positive in a number of short-term tests inducing gene mutations and chromosomal damage. the reactive form could be either the diisocyanate itself or may derive from the metabolic activation of the aromatic diamine derivatives formed by hydrolysis. tdi and mdi react with dna in vivo and in vitro. however, the structure of the adducts has not been identified. especially from the in vivo experiment it is not known if the adducts are a product from the reaction with the isocyanate or the corresponding amine. in conclusion, both tdi and mdi are highly reactive chemicals that bind to dna and are probably genotoxic. the alleged animal carcinogenicity of tdi and mdi would suggest that occupational exposure to these compounds is a carcinogenic risk. the few epidemiological studies available have not, however, been able to clarify if tdi and mdi are occupational carcinogens.
unique distribution of aromatase in the human brain: in vivo studies with pet and [n‐methyl‐11c]vorozole abstract four rhesus monkeys were surgically implanted with arrays of subcortical electrodes and trained to self-administer rewarding electrical stimulation (icss) to the hypothalamus. in all four animals, concurrent electrical stimulation of the ca3 region of uncal anterior hippocampus or of the cortico-medial region of amygdala inhibited hypothalamic icss. in two of the four animals, concurrent stimulation of the more posterior hippocampus (ca3) facilitated icss. concurrent stimulation of other areas (including basolateral amygdala, hippocampal ca4 region, internal capsule, optic tract, thalamus, and caudate nucleus) had no effect on hypothalamic icss. it is suggested that hypothalamic reinforcement processes may vary according to the parameters of limbic involvement.
first report of babesia gibsoni in central america and survey for vector-borne infections in dogs from nicaragua two species of hepatozoon are currently known to infect dogs and cause distinct diseases. hepatozoon canis prevalent in africa, asia, southern europe, south america and recently shown to be present also in the usa causes infection mainly of hemolymphoid organs, whereas hepatozoon americanum prevalent in the southeastern usa causes myositis and severe lameness. h. americanum is transmitted by ingestion of the gulf coast tick amblyomma maculatum and also by predation on infected prey. h. canis is transmitted by rhipicephalus sanguineus, in south america also by amblyomma ovale, and has also been shown to be transmitted transplacentally. hepatozoonosis of domestic cats has been described mostly from the same areas where canine infection is present and the exact identity of the species which infect cats, their pathogenicity and vectors have not been elucidated. the diagnosis of hepatozoonosis is made by observation of gamonts in blood smears, histopathology, pcr or serology. the main treatment for h. canis is with imidocarb dipropionate whereas h. americanum infection is treated with an initial combination of trimethoprim-sulfadiazine, pyrimethamine and clindamycin followed by maintenance with decoquinate. treatment for both diseases has not been reported to facilitate complete parasite elimination and new effective drugs are needed for the management of these infections. prevention of hepatozoonosis should be based on avoidance of oral ingestion of infected tick vectors and infected prey.
phenotypic and functional separation of memory and effector human cd 8 1 t cells cd27, a lymphocyte-specific member of the tnf/ngf-r family, is expressed on the majority of peripheral blood t cells. activation of t cells via tcr/cd3 induces high cd27 surface expression and the release of a soluble extracellular part of the molecule. after prolonged activation in vitro, cd27 becomes gradually switched off. there is evidence that also in vivo, cd4+ cells that have persistently been stimulated by ag, accumulate within the cd45ra-cd27- subset. in addition, an increase of cd27- t cells has been observed under certain immunopathologic conditions and during aging. this study was undertaken to analyze the regulation of cd27 on different t-cell subsets and to determine whether the loss of cd27 expression is an irreversible event and may thereby mark t-cell differentiation. in agreement with earlier findings, all cd4+cd45ra+cd45ro- t cells were found to express cd27, whereas a small fraction of the cd4+cd45ra-cd45ro+ subset lacks the molecule. in contrast, within the cd8+ compartment cd27- subsets were found both in the cd45ra+ and cd45ra- subpopulations. after stimulation with cd3 mab, both cd27 membrane expression and release was equally up-regulated in cd4+ and cd8+ subpopulations. this stimulus, however, provoked a strikingly predominant up-regulation of membrane cd27 on cd45ro- cells as compared with cd45ra- cells. on cd4+cd45ra-cd27- t cells and long-term grown cd45ra-cd27- tlc, cd27 expression could not be reinduced after stimulation of the tcr/cd3 complex, neither at the protein nor at the mrna level. comparison of cd27 expression with its structural homologue fas/apo-1 showed that down-regulation after prolonged activation is not a general feature of tnf/ngf-r family members. the cd27 ligand was recently identified and was shown to give a co-stimulatory signal to pha-activated t cells. the restricted up-regulation of cd27 on cd45ra+ cells after t-cell stimulation may point at a discrete role of cd27-cd27 ligand interaction during transition of cd45ro- to cd45ra- t cells. in addition, the cd27 negative phenotype seems a stable reflection of differentiation rather than of activation.
escape of sgs1 from rad9 inhibition reduces the requirement for sae2 and functional mrx in dna end resection abstract the mre11 complex is a central component of the dna damage response, with roles in damage sensing, molecular bridging, and end resection. we have previously shown that in saccharomyces cerevisiae, ku70 (yku70) deficiency reduces the ionizing radiation sensitivity of mre11δ mutants. in this study, we show that yku70 deficiency suppressed the camptothecin (cpt) and methyl methanesulfonate (mms) sensitivity of nuclease-deficient mre11-3 and sae2δ mutants in an exo1-dependent manner. cpt-induced g2/m arrest, γ-h2ax persistence, and chromosome breaks were elevated in mre11-3 mutants. these outcomes were reduced by yku70 deficiency. given that the genotoxic effects of cpt are manifest during dna replication, these data suggest that ku limits exo1-dependent double-strand break (dsb) resection during dna replication, inhibiting the initial processing steps required for homology-directed repair. we propose that mre11 nuclease- and sae2-dependent dna end processing, which initiates dsb resection prevents ku from engaging dsbs, thus promoting exo1-dependent resection. in agreement with this idea, we show that ku affinity for binding to short single-stranded overhangs is much lower than for blunt dna ends. collectively, the data define a nonhomologous end joining (nhej)-independent, s-phase-specific function of the ku heterodimer.
effect of household-based drinking water chlorination on diarrhoea among children under five in orissa, india: a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial abstract background diarrhoea is a major cause of death and disease, especially among young children in low‐income countries. in these settings, many infectious agents associated with diarrhoea are spread through water contaminated with faeces. in remote and low‐income settings, source‐based water quality improvement includes providing protected groundwater (springs, wells, and bore holes), or harvested rainwater as an alternative to surface sources (rivers and lakes). point‐of‐use water quality improvement interventions include boiling, chlorination, flocculation, filtration, or solar disinfection, mainly conducted at home. objectives to assess the effectiveness of interventions to improve water quality for preventing diarrhoea. search methods we searched the cochrane infectious diseases group specialized register (11 november 2014), central (the cochrane library, 7 november 2014), medline (1966 to 10 november 2014), embase (1974 to 10 november 2014), and lilacs (1982 to 7 november 2014). we also handsearched relevant conference proceedings, contacted researchers and organizations working in the field, and checked references from identified studies through 11 november 2014. selection criteria randomized controlled trials (rcts), quasi‐rcts, and controlled before‐and‐after studies (cba) comparing interventions aimed at improving the microbiological quality of drinking water with no intervention in children and adults. data collection and analysis two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. we used meta‐analyses to estimate pooled measures of effect, where appropriate, and investigated potential sources of heterogeneity using subgroup analyses. we assessed the quality of evidence using the grade approach. main results forty‐five cluster‐rcts, two quasi‐rcts, and eight cba studies, including over 84,000 participants, met the inclusion criteria. most included studies were conducted in low‐ or middle‐income countries (lmics) (50 studies) with unimproved water sources (30 studies) and unimproved or unclear sanitation (34 studies). the primary outcome in most studies was self‐reported diarrhoea, which is at high risk of bias due to the lack of blinding in over 80% of the included studies. source‐based water quality improvements there is currently insufficient evidence to know if source‐based improvements such as protected wells, communal tap stands, or chlorination/filtration of community sources consistently reduce diarrhoea (one cluster‐rct, five cba studies, very low quality evidence). we found no studies evaluating reliable piped‐in water supplies delivered to households. point‐of‐use water quality interventions on average, distributing water disinfection products for use at the household level may reduce diarrhoea by around one quarter (home chlorination products: rr 0.77, 95% ci 0.65 to 0.91; 14 trials, 30,746 participants, low quality evidence; flocculation and disinfection sachets: rr 0.69, 95% ci 0.58 to 0.82, four trials, 11,788 participants, moderate quality evidence). however, there was substantial heterogeneity in the size of the effect estimates between individual studies. point‐of‐use filtration systems probably reduce diarrhoea by around a half (rr 0.48, 95% ci 0.38 to 0.59, 18 trials, 15,582 participants, moderate quality evidence). important reductions in diarrhoea episodes were shown with ceramic filters, biosand systems and lifestraw® filters; (ceramic: rr 0.39, 95% ci 0.28 to 0.53; eight trials, 5763 participants, moderate quality evidence; biosand: rr 0.47, 95% ci 0.39 to 0.57; four trials, 5504 participants, moderate quality evidence; lifestraw®: rr 0.69, 95% ci 0.51 to 0.93; three trials, 3259 participants, low quality evidence). plumbed in filters have only been evaluated in high‐income settings (rr 0.81, 95% ci 0.71 to 0.94, three trials, 1056 participants, fixed effects model). in low‐income settings, solar water disinfection (sodis) by distribution of plastic bottles with instructions to leave filled bottles in direct sunlight for at least six hours before drinking probably reduces diarrhoea by around a third (rr 0.62, 95% ci 0.42 to 0.94; four trials, 3460 participants, moderate quality evidence). in subgroup analyses, larger effects were seen in trials with higher adherence, and trials that provided a safe storage container. in most cases, the reduction in diarrhoea shown in the studies was evident in settings with improved and unimproved water sources and sanitation. authors' conclusions interventions that address the microbial contamination of water at the point‐of‐use may be important interim measures to improve drinking water quality until homes can be reached with safe, reliable, piped‐in water connections. the average estimates of effect for each individual point‐of‐use intervention generally show important effects. comparisons between these estimates do not provide evidence of superiority of one intervention over another, as such comparisons are confounded by the study setting, design, and population. further studies assessing the effects of household connections and chlorination at the point of delivery will help improve our knowledge base. as evidence suggests effectiveness improves with adherence, studies assessing programmatic approaches to optimising coverage and long‐term utilization of these interventions among vulnerable populations could also help strategies to improve health outcomes. 16 april 2019 update pending studies awaiting assessment the cidg is currently examining a new search conducted in april 2019 for potentially relevant studies. these studies have not yet been incorporated into this cochrane review.
luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone induces nuclear factor k b-activation and inhibits apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells we report here the purification and cdna cloning of apaf-1, a novel 130 kd protein from hela cell cytosol that participates in the cytochrome c-dependent activation of caspase-3. the nh2-terminal 85 amino acids of apaf-1 show 21% identity and 53% similarity to the nh2-terminal prodomain of the caenorhabditis elegans caspase, ced-3. this is followed by 320 amino acids that show 22% identity and 48% similarity to ced-4, a protein that is believed to initiate apoptosis in c. elegans. the cooh-terminal region of apaf-1 comprises multiple wd repeats, which are proposed to mediate protein-protein interactions. cytochrome c binds to apaf-1, an event that may trigger the activation of caspase-3, leading to apoptosis.
pharmacokinetics of intravenous n-acetylcysteine in men at rest and during exercise the production of reactive oxygen species in skeletal muscle is linked with muscle fatigue. this study investigated whether the antioxidant compound n-acetylcysteine (nac) augments time to fatigue during prolonged, submaximal cycling exercise. seven men completed a double-blind, crossover study, receiving nac or placebo before and during cycling exercise, comprising 45 min at 70% of peak oxygen consumption (vo2 peak) and then to fatigue at 90% vo2 peak. nac was intravenously infused at 125 mg.kg-1.h-1 for 15 min and then 25 mg.kg-1.h-1 for 20 min before and throughout exercise, which was continued until fatigue. arterialized venous blood was analyzed for nac concentration, hematology, and plasma electrolytes. nac induced no serious adverse reactions and did not affect hematology, acid-base status, or plasma electrolytes. time to fatigue was reproducible in preliminary trials (coefficient of variation 7.4 +/- 1.2%) and was not augmented by nac (nac 14.6 +/- 4.5 min; control 12.8 +/- 5.4 min). however, time to fatigue during nac trials was correlated with vo2 peak (r = 0.78; p < 0.05), suggesting that nac effects on performance may be dependent on training status. the rise in plasma k+ concentration at fatigue was attenuated by nac (p < 0.05). the ratio of rise in k+ concentration to work and the percentage change in time to fatigue tended to be inversely related (r = -0.71; p < 0.07). further research is required to clarify a possible training status-dependent effect of nac on muscle performance and k+ regulation.
carotenoids and carotenogenic genes in podospora anserina: engineering of the carotenoid composition extends the life span of the mycelium backgroundthe dung-inhabiting ascomycete fungus podospora anserina is a model used to study various aspects of eukaryotic and fungal biology, such as ageing, prions and sexual development.resultswe present a 10x draft sequence of p. anserina genome, linked to the sequences of a large expressed sequence tag collection. similar to higher eukaryotes, the p. anserina transcription/splicing machinery generates numerous non-conventional transcripts. comparison of the p. anserina genome and orthologous gene set with the one of its close relatives, neurospora crassa, shows that synteny is poorly conserved, the main result of evolution being gene shuffling in the same chromosome. the p. anserina genome contains fewer repeated sequences and has evolved new genes by duplication since its separation from n. crassa, despite the presence of the repeat induced point mutation mechanism that mutates duplicated sequences. we also provide evidence that frequent gene loss took place in the lineages leading to p. anserina and n. crassa. p. anserina contains a large and highly specialized set of genes involved in utilization of natural carbon sources commonly found in its natural biotope. it includes genes potentially involved in lignin degradation and efficient cellulose breakdown.conclusionthe features of the p. anserina genome indicate a highly dynamic evolution since the divergence of p. anserina and n. crassa, leading to the ability of the former to use specific complex carbon sources that match its needs in its natural biotope.
an approach to the genetics of nitrogen use efficiency in maize. a full-length cdna clone, pmgdh1, encoding maize nadh-glutamate dehydrogenase (nadh-gdh) was isolated from a maize root cdna library. the identity of the cdna was established by the coincidence of the structure of the purified protein with that inferred from the nucleotide sequence of the cdna. pmgdh1 had a cdna insert of 1,638 bp and the open reading frame encoded 411 amino acid residues. the deduced amino acid sequence was similar to putative partial sequences of gdhs from higher plants and to the sequences of gdhs from organisms as diverse as mammals and bacteria. the nh2-terminal sequence deduced from the open reading frame had a typical structure that is associated with the import of proteins into the mitochondrial matrix. the cdna hybridized to an rna of about 1.6 kb. this transcript was more abundant in roots than in leaves and was localized in the bundle sheath cells in leaf tissues. analysis of genomic dna by southern hybridization suggested the existence of gene(s) for another nadh-gdh subunit(s).
dose-dependent modulation of myogenesis by hgf: implications for c-met expression and downstream signalling pathways skeletal muscle growth and regeneration are attributed to satellite cells - muscle stem cells resident beneath the basal lamina that surrounds each myofibre. quiescent satellite cells express the transcription factor pax7 and when activated, coexpress pax7 with myod. most then proliferate, downregulate pax7 and differentiate. by contrast, others maintain pax7 but lose myod and return to a state resembling quiescence. here we show that pax7 is able to drive transcription in quiescent and activated satellite cells, and continues to do so in those cells that subsequently cease proliferation and withdraw from immediate differentiation. we found that constitutive expression of pax7 in satellite-cell-derived myoblasts did not affect myod expression or proliferation. although maintained expression of pax7 delayed the onset of myogenin expression it did not prevent, and was compatible with, myogenic differentiation. constitutive pax7 expression in a pax7-null c2c12 subclone increased the proportion of cells expressing myod, showing that pax7 can act genetically upstream of myod. however these pax7-null cells were unable to differentiate into normal myotubes in the presence of pax7. therefore pax7 may be involved in maintaining proliferation and preventing precocious differentiation, but does not promote quiescence.
verifying synchronization for atomicity violation fixing fixing software bugs has always been an important and time-consuming process in software development. fixing concurrency bugs has become especially critical in the multicore era. however, fixing concurrency bugs is challenging, in part due to non-deterministic failures and tricky parallel reasoning. beyond correctly fixing the original problem in the software, a good patch should also avoid introducing new bugs, degrading performance unnecessarily, or damaging software readability. existing tools cannot automate the whole fixing process and provide good-quality patches.  we present afix, a tool that automates the whole process of fixing one common type of concurrency bug: single-variable atomicity violations. afix starts from the bug reports of existing bug-detection tools. it augments these with static analysis to construct a suitable patch for each bug report. it further tries to combine the patches of multiple bugs for better performance and code readability. finally, afix's run-time component provides testing customized for each patch. our evaluation shows that patches automatically generated by afix correctly eliminate six out of eight real-world bugs and significantly decrease the failure probability in the other two cases. afix patches never introduce new bugs and usually have similar performance to manually-designed patches.
ontological structures for knowledge sharing the kraft project aims to investigate how a distributed architecture can support the transformation and reuse of a particular class of knowledge, namely constraints, and to fuse this knowledge so as to gain added value, by using it for constraint solving or data retrieval.
cardiac interstitial bradykinin release during ischemia is enhanced by ischemic preconditioning. ischemic preconditioning is a phenomenon in which exposure of the heart to a brief period of ischemia causes it to quickly adapt itself to become resistant to infarction from a subsequent ischemic insult. the mechanism is not fully understood but, at least in the rabbit, it is known to be triggered by occupation of adenosine receptors, opioid receptors, bradykinin receptors and the generation of free radicals during the preconditioning ischemia. all of these are thought to converge on and activate protein kinase c (pkc), which in turn activates a tyrosine kinase. this kinase cascade eventually terminates on some unknown effector, possibly a potassium channel or a cytoskeletal protein, which makes the cells resistant to infarction. if this process can be understood, it should be possible to devise a method for conferring this protection to patients with acute myocardial infarction.
maternal enodls are required for pollen tube reception in arabidopsis enod40 is one of the genes associated with legume nodule development and has a putative role in general plant organogenesis. we have isolated a small enod40 gene family from white clover (trifolium repens), with three genes designated trenod40-1, trenod40-2, and trenod40-3, all containing the conserved enod40 regions i and ii. trenod40-1 and trenod40-2 share over 90% homology in the transcribed regions and high levels of similarity in their upstream regulatory sequences. trenod40-1 and trenod40-2 are similar to the enod40 genes of legumes forming indeterminate nodules (group ii) and are predominantly expressed in nodules. trenod40-3 shares only 32.8% identity with trenod40-1 and trenod40-2 within the transcribed region. trenod40-3 is similar to the enod40 genes of legumes with determinate nodules (group i) and is not predominantly expressed in nodules. to our knowledge, this is the first report of both group iand group ii-type enod40 genes being expressed in a single legume species. in situ hybridization studies revealed that trenod40 genes were highly expressed in non-symbiotic tissues, particularly in stolon nodes during nodal root and lateral shoot development. high levels of trenod40 transcripts were also present in the vascular bundles of mature plant organs, mainly at sites of intensive lateral transport, suggesting a role in vascular tissue function. the expression pattern of trenod40 genes was analyzed further using trenod40 promoter-gus fusions in transgenic white clover and tobacco (nicotiana tabacum), indicating that white clover and tobacco share the regulatory mechanisms for trenod40-1/2 promoters and some aspects of trenod40-3 regulation.
protein kinase c ( pkc )-a activation inhibits pkc-z and mediates the action of ped / pea-15 on glucose transport in the l 6 skeletal muscle cells we have used differential display to identify genes whose expression is altered in type 2 diabetes thus contributing to its pathogenesis. one mrna is overexpressed in fibroblasts from type 2 diabetics compared with non‐diabetic individuals, as well as in skeletal muscle and adipose tissues, two major sites of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. the levels of the protein encoded by this mrna are also elevated in type 2 diabetic tissues; thus, we named it ped for phosphoprotein enriched in diabetes. ped cloning shows that it encodes a 15 kda phosphoprotein identical to the protein kinase c (pkc) substrate pea‐15. the ped gene maps on human chromosome 1q21–22. transfection of ped/pea‐15 in differentiating l6 skeletal muscle cells increases the content of glut1 transporters on the plasma membrane and inhibits insulin‐stimulated glucose transport and cell‐surface recruitment of glut4, the major insulin‐sensitive glucose transporter. these effects of ped overexpression are reversed by blocking pkc activity. overexpression of the ped/pea‐15 gene may contribute to insulin resistance in glucose uptake in type 2 diabetes.
pelvic floor disorders among women in dabat district, northwest ethiopia: a pilot study context pelvic floor disorders (urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, and pelvic organ prolapse) affect many women. no national prevalence estimates derived from the same population-based sample exists for multiple pelvic floor disorders in women in the united states.   objective to provide national prevalence estimates of symptomatic pelvic floor disorders in us women.   design, setting, and participants a cross-sectional analysis of 1961 nonpregnant women (>or=20 years) who participated in the 2005-2006 national health and nutrition examination survey, a nationally representative survey of the us noninstitutionalized population. women were interviewed in their homes and then underwent standardized physical examinations in a mobile examination center. urinary incontinence (score of >or=3 on a validated incontinence severity index, constituting moderate to severe leakage), fecal incontinence (at least monthly leakage of solid, liquid, or mucous stool), and pelvic organ prolapse (seeing/feeling a bulge in or outside the vagina) symptoms were assessed.   main outcome measures weighted prevalence estimates of urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, and pelvic organ prolapse symptoms.   results the weighted prevalence of at least 1 pelvic floor disorder was 23.7% (95% confidence interval [ci], 21.2%-26.2%), with 15.7% of women (95% ci, 13.2%-18.2%) experiencing urinary incontinence, 9.0% of women (95% ci, 7.3%-10.7%) experiencing fecal incontinence, and 2.9% of women (95% ci, 2.1%-3.7%) experiencing pelvic organ prolapse. the proportion of women reporting at least 1 disorder increased incrementally with age, ranging from 9.7% (95% ci, 7.8%-11.7%) in women between ages 20 and 39 years to 49.7% (95% ci, 40.3%-59.1%) in those aged 80 years or older (p < .001), and parity (12.8% [95% ci, 9.0%-16.6%], 18.4% [95% ci, 12.9%-23.9%], 24.6% [95% ci, 19.5%-29.8%], and 32.4% [95% ci, 27.8%-37.1%] for 0, 1, 2, and 3 or more deliveries, respectively; p < .001). overweight and obese women were more likely to report at least 1 pelvic floor disorder than normal weight women (26.3% [95% ci, 21.7%-30.9%], 30.4% [95% ci, 25.8%-35.0%], and 15.1% [95% ci, 11.6%-18.7%], respectively; p < .001). we detected no differences in prevalence by racial/ethnic group.   conclusion pelvic floor disorders affect a substantial proportion of women and increase with age.
primary murine microglia are resistant to nitric oxide inhibition of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase induction of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (ido) and nitric oxide synthase (nos) is involved in the immunomodulatory roles of ifn-gamma and evidence suggests that these pathways are functionally cross-regulated. we report here that nitric oxide (no) negatively modulates the expression of ido activity in ifn-gamma-primed macrophages, but not in microglial cells from mouse. in mt2 macrophages, the induction of ido activity by ifn-gamma was further increased by the presence of nos inhibitors, whereas culturing of ifn-gamma-activated mt2 cells with no generators produced a marked reduction of ido activity expression. conversely, neither nos inhibitors nor exogenous no affected the induction of the enzyme activity in n11 microglial cells after ifn-gamma activation. lps and picolinic acid, two costimulatory agents that up-regulate inducible nos in activated cells, regulated ido induction differently in the two cell lines. lps and picolinic acid caused a significant decrease of ido activity in ifn-gamma-activated mt2 cells. this effect, however, did not appear to be mediated by the ability of lps and picolinic acid to stimulate no production. in n11 cells, lps further stimulated the enzyme activity and picolinic acid had no effect. northern blot analysis revealed that, in mt2 macrophages, nos inhibitors increased the levels of ido mrna, while a reduction was observed with picolinic acid. no changes in ido mrna levels were detected in n11 cells. consistent with the functional heterogeneity of phagocytes, the reported results indicate the existence of marked differences in the regulation of ido expression between murine macrophages and microglial cells.
gaba-immunohistological observations, at the electron-microscopical level, of the neurons of isthmic nuclei in chicken, gallus domesticus the chick brain is a useful model system for studying the ontogeny and phylogeny of neural circuitry, especially that of the visual system. in this study the distribution of cells and processes showing gaba‐like immunoreactivity (gaba+) in the diencephalon and mesencephalon of the posthatch chick was determined immunohistochemically with a polyclonal antibody to gaba and compared with the results of similar studies in mammals. most of the small gaba+ cells were found in the chick visual centers such as the nucleus lateralis anterior, suprachiasmatic nucleus, ventral lateral geniculate, optic tract, dorsolateralis anterior pars lateralis, lentiformis mesencephali, ectomammillary nucleus, area pretectalis, and the optic tectum. large gaba+ cells were found in the following nuclei: reticularis superior, posteroventralis thalami, subpretectalis, isthmi pars magnocellularis, interstitiopretectosubpretectalis, mesencephalicus lateralis pars dorsalis. these large cell‐containing nuclei receive projections from visual or auditory centers. gaba+ axons were found throughout the diencephalon and mesencephalon but were especially prominent in the ansa lenticularis, fasciculus medialis longitudinalis, and optic tract. the distribution of gaba+ cells in the chick is more widespread than in rodents and exhibits an increased association with the visual centers suggesting a correlation with the specialized visual requirements of the bird.
a diffusion-reaction model of signal transduction by mapk cascades cells respond to a plethora of signals using a limited set of intracellular signal transduction components. surprisingly, pathways that transduce distinct signals can share protein components, yet avoid erroneous cross-talk. a highly tractable model system in which to study this paradox is the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, which harbors three mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) signal transduction cascades that share multiple signaling components. in this review we first describe potential mechanisms by which specificity could be achieved by signaling pathways that share components. second, we summarize key features and components of the yeast mapk pathways that control the mating pheromone response, filamentous growth, and the response to high osmolarity. finally, we review biochemical analyses in yeast of mutations that cause cross-talk between these three mapk pathways and their implications for the mechanistic bases for signaling specificity. although much remains to be learned, current data indicate that scaffolding and cross pathway inhibition play key roles in the maintenance of fidelity.

inferring past demographic changes from contemporary genetic data: a simulation‐based evaluation of the abc methods implemented in diyabc the analysis of genetic variation to estimate demographic and historical parameters and to quantitatively compare alternative scenarios recently gained a powerful and flexible approach: the approximate bayesian computation (abc). the likelihood functions does not need to be theoretically specified, but posterior distributions can be approximated by simulation even assuming very complex population models including both natural and human‐induced processes. prior information can be easily incorporated and the quality of the results can be analysed with rather limited additional effort. abc is not a statistical analysis per se, but rather a statistical framework and any specific application is a sort of hybrid between a simulation and a data‐analysis study. complete software packages performing the necessary steps under a set of models and for specific genetic markers are already available, but the flexibility of the method is better exploited combining different programs. many questions relevant in ecology can be addressed using abc, but adequate amount of time should be dedicated to decide among alternative options and to evaluate the results. in this paper we will describe and critically comment on the different steps of an abc analysis, analyse some of the published applications of abc and provide user guidelines.
baseline chronic kidney disease and ischemic method of partial nephrectomy are important factors for the short- and long-term deterioration in renal function for renal cell carcinoma staged t1-t2: a retrospective single center study the activity of the malate-aspartate shuttle for the reoxidation of cytoplasmic reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nadh) by mitochondria was assessed in six lines of rodent ascites tumor cells (two strains of ehrlich ascites carcinoma, krebs ii carcinoma, novikoff hepatoma, as-30d hepatoma, and l1210 mouse leukemia). all the tumor cells examined showed mitochondrial reoxidation of cytoplasmic nadh, as evidenced by the accumulation of pyruvate when the cells were incubated aerobically with l-lactate. reoxidation of cytoplasmic nadh thus generated was completely inhibited by the transaminase inhibitor aminooxyacetate. the involvement of the respiratory chain in the reoxidation of cytoplasmic nadh was demonstrated by the action of cyanide, rotenone, and antimycin a, which strongly inhibited the formation of pyruvate from added l-lactate. compounds that inhibit the carrier-mediated entry of malate into mitochondria, such as butylmalonate, benzenetricarboxylate, and iodobenzylmalonate, also inhibited the accumulation of pyruvate from added l-lactate by the tumor cells. the maximal rate of the malate-aspartate shuttle was established by addtion of arsenite to inhibit the mitochondrial oxidation of the pyruvate formed from added lactate. the capacity of the various tumor lines for the reoxidation of cytoplasmic nadh via the malate-aspartate shuttle approaches 20% of the total respiratory rate of the cells and thus appears to be sufficient to account for the mitochondrial reoxidation of that fraction of glycolytic nadh not reoxidized by pyruvate and lactate dehydrognenase in the cytoplasm.
custom-fit minimally invasive total knee arthroplasty: effect on blood loss and early clinical outcomes purposecorrect alignment of the leg and positioning of the components are important factors in good long-term outcome of total knee arthroplasty (tka). computer-assisted navigation systems were introduced to improve component alignment accuracies. the three main hypotheses of this study were that the navigated compared to jig-based patient will show the following: (1) no difference in clinical outcomes. (2) better alignment in the frontal and sagittal plane. (3) better rotational positioning of components.methodsthe authors evaluated 100 patients who had minimally invasive tka using either an image-free computer-assisted navigation system (n = 50) or a jig-based technique (n = 50). six months postoperatively, clinical and radiological evaluations were performed using full-length standing anteroposterior and lateral radiographs and ct scans of the knee.resultsknee society knee score, function score, and range of motion were comparable in the two groups after surgery. the percentage of patients with a frontal tibiofemoral angle within ±3° of the ideal was significantly higher in the navigated group than in the jig-based group (94% vs. 78%, respectively; p = 0.041). no significant differences were found between groups in terms of the frontal and sagittal planes as well as rotational alignment of the femoral or tibial components.conclusioncomputer-assisted tka gives a better correction of alignment of the leg compared with jig-based tka when combined with a minimally invasive surgical approach.
standstill frequency response test for obtaining parameters of six phase double delta salient-pole synchronous machine on example of claw-pole alternator this paper presents the steps of the approach to identify the linear parameters of a salient-pole synchronous machine at standstill and by frequency response tests data (ssfr). it is currently established and demonstrated that stability parameters for synchronous machines can be obtained by performing frequency response tests with the machine at standstill. the objective of this study is to use several input-output signals, according to a setup test recommended by the standard ieee std 115, to identify the model structure and parameters of a salient-pole synchronous machine from frequency response tests data. this procedure consists of defining and conducting the frequency response tests, identifying the model structure, estimating the corresponding parameters, and making valid the resulting model. we estimate the parameters of operational impedances, or in other terms, the reactances and the time constants. the results are presented from tests on the synchronous machine of 1.5 kva/380v/1500 rpm. k e y w o r d s: synchronous machine, parameter estimation, modeling, standstill tests, frequency response
the mechanoreflex and hemodynamic response to passive leg movement in heart failure. we investigated the role of somatosensory feedback on cardioventilatory responses to rhythmic exercise in five men. in a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, subjects performed the same leg cycling exercise (50/100/150/325 ± 19 w, 3 min each) under placebo conditions (interspinous saline, l(3)-l(4)) and with lumbar intrathecal fentanyl impairing central projection of spinal opioid receptor-sensitive muscle afferents. quadriceps strength was similar before and after fentanyl administration. to evaluate whether a cephalad migration of fentanyl affected cardioventilatory control centers in the brain stem, we compared resting ventilatory responses to hypercapnia (hcvr) and cardioventilatory responses to arm vs. leg cycling exercise after each injection. similar hcvr and minor effects of fentanyl on cardioventilatory responses to arm exercise excluded direct medullary effects of fentanyl. central command during leg exercise was estimated via quadriceps electromyogram. no differences between conditions were found in resting heart rate (hr), ventilation [minute ventilation (ve)], or mean arterial pressure (map). quadriceps electromyogram, o(2) consumption (vo(2)), and plasma lactate were similar in both conditions at the four steady-state workloads. compared with placebo, a substantial hypoventilation during fentanyl exercise was indicated by the 8-17% reduction in ve/co(2) production (vco(2)) secondary to a reduced breathing frequency, leading to average increases of 4-7 torr in end-tidal pco(2) (p < 0.001) and a reduced hemoglobin saturation (-3 ± 1%; p < 0.05) at the heaviest workload (∼90% maximal vo(2)) with fentanyl. hr was reduced 2-8%, map 8-13%, and ratings of perceived exertion by 13% during fentanyl vs. placebo exercise (p < 0.05). these findings demonstrate the essential contribution of muscle afferent feedback to the ventilatory, cardiovascular, and perceptual responses to rhythmic exercise in humans, even in the presence of unaltered contributions from other major inputs to cardioventilatory control.
parental occupational exposure to pesticides and childhood brain cancer. pesticides are used worldwide in agriculture, industry, public health and for domestic applications: as a consequence, a great part of the population may be exposed to these compounds. in spite of this extensive use, knowledge on the health risks associated with prolonged exposure is rather poor, and major uncertainties still exist. epidemiological observations in man have so far produced little conclusive information, mainly because of weaknesses in exposure assessment. therefore, information on the type and levels of exposure is fundamental in order to better understand and characterize risk to human health. exposure assessment can be carried out via measurement of environmental concentrations, as well as via determination of the chemical or its metabolites in body tissues (biological monitoring). besides indices of internal dose, biological monitoring also includes measurements of early effects attributable to interaction between the chemical agent and the human body. biological monitoring has the advantage, over environmental monitoring, of determining the dose actually absorbed via any possible route: differences in absorption can be taken into account. whether they are due to biological variability or to use of protective equipment. when, in some cases, a combination of occupational and non-occupational exposure occurs, this also can be taken into consideration by biological monitoring. few reference documents have been published on biological monitoring of pesticides. for this reason, the office of occupational health of the world health organization gave icps a mandate to prepare a monograph specifically addressed to reviewing methods for biological monitoring of pesticide exposure. this review is based on more than 300 studies published over the period 1980-1999. for the most representative chemical classes, the available biological exposure indices are reported. both indices of internal dose and. when available, of early effects are discussed. the reported tests were used to monitor exposure of pesticide applicators in agriculture and public health, manufacturing and formulating workers. subjects poisoned after accidental exposure or attempted suicide, volunteers involved in pharmacokinetic studies, as well as sub-groups of the general population exposed to environmentally persistent pesticides. single chapters deal with organophosphorus insecticides, carbamate pesticides, dithiocarbamates, phenoxyacids, quaternary ammonium compounds. coumarin rodenticides, synthetic pyrethroids, organochlorine pesticides, chlorotriazines, and pentachlorophenol.
vaccinations and malaria prophylaxis for long-term travellers travelling from greece: a prospective, questionnaire-based analysis. an increasing number of travelers travel to hepatitis b-endemic countries. in travel medicine, vaccinations should be advised according to risks. the actual incidence of hepatitis b infection in short-term tourists is very low and probably not higher than it is for people who do not travel. there is evidence that long-term travelers and immigrants originating from hepatitis b-endemic countries are at higher risk of infection and they should always be offered vaccination. for all other travelers living in countries with universal hepatitis b vaccination, vaccination could be advised as a catch-up strategy.
screening for depression in adults: a summary of the evidence for the u.s. preventive services task force background high utilizers of nonpsychiatric health care services have disproportionally high rates of undiagnosed or undertreated depression.   objective to determine the impact of offering a systematic primary care-based depression treatment program to depressed "high utilizers" not in active treatment.   design randomized clinical trial.   setting one hundred sixty-three primary care practices in 3 health maintenance organizations located in different geographic regions of the united states.   patients a group of 1465 health maintenance organization members were identified as depressed high utilizers using a 2-stage telephone screening process. eligibility criteria were met by 410 patients and 407 agreed to enroll: 218 in the depression management program (dmp) practices and 189 in the usual care (uc) group.   intervention the dmp included patient education materials, physician education programs, telephone-based treatment coordination, and antidepressant pharmacotherapy initiated and managed by patients' primary care physicians.   main outcome measures depression severity was measured using the hamilton depression rating scale (ham-d) and functional status using the medical outcomes study 20-item short form (sf-20) subscales. outpatient visit and hospitalization rates were measured using the health plan's encounter data.   results based on an intent-to-treat analysis, at least 3 antidepressant prescriptions were filled in the first 6 months by 151 (69.3%) of 218 of dmp patients vs 35 (18.5%) of 189 in uc (p < .001). improvements in ham-d scores were significantly greater in the intervention group at 6 weeks (p = .04), 3 months (p = .02), 6 months (p < .001), and 12 months (p < .001). at 12 months, dmp intervention patients were more improved than uc patients on the mental health, social functioning, and general health perceptions scales of the sf-20 (p < .05 for all).   conclusion in depressed high utilizers not already in active treatment, a systematic primary care-based treatment program can substantially increase adequate antidepressant treatment, decrease depression severity, and improve general health status compared with usual care.
neurochemical evidence for agmatine modulation of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (mptp) neurotoxicity the biochemical and cellular changes that occur following administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (mptp) are remarkably similar to that seen in idiopathic parkinson's disease (pd). in this review, we detail the molecular activities of this compound from peripheral intoxication through its various biotransformations. in addition, we detail the interplay that occurs between the different cellular compartments (neurons and glia) that eventually consort to kill substantia nigra pars compacta (snpc) neurons.
a language modeling approach for the recommendation of tourism-related services we describe our efforts in trec 2012 contextual suggestion track. the task is to provide sug- gestions to users based on their personal interests as well as their contexts. to tackle the problem, we propose to rank candidate suggestions based on their similarity to the personal profile and that to the contexts (i.e., geographic and temporal information). the ranking function is computed based on the similarity between a suggestion and the places that the user like and the dis-similarity between the suggestion and the places disliked by the user. the similarities are computed based on the either the category or description of the suggestions.
an aqueous extract of marine microalgae exhibits antimetastatic activity through preferential killing of suspended cancer cells and anticolony forming activity angiogenesis is required for invasive tumor growth and metastasis and constitutes an important point in the control of cancer progression. its inhibition may be a valuable new approach to cancer therapy. avascular tumors are severely restricted in their growth potential because of the lack of a blood supply. for tumors to develop in size and metastatic potential they must make an "angiogenic switch" through perturbing the local balance of proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors. frequently, tumors overexpress proangiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, allowing them to make this angiogenic switch. two strategies used in the development of antiangiogenic agents involve the inhibition of proangiogenic factors (eg, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibodies) as well as therapy with endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis, such as endostatin and angiostatin. therapy with endogenous angiogenic inhibitors such as endostatin and angiostatin may reverse the angiogenic switch preventing growth of tumor vasculature. preclinical studies have shown that endostatin effectively inhibits tumor growth and shrinks existing tumor blood vessels. phase 1 clinical trials of endostatin and angiostatin are ongoing, and preliminary results show minimal toxicities.
amadori‐glycated phosphatidylethanolamine up‐regulates telomerase activity in panc‐1 human pancreatic carcinoma cells glycation has been implicated in the endothelial dysfunction that contributes to both diabetes‐ and aging‐associated vascular complications. the aim of the present study was to determine whether amadori‐glycated phosphatidylethanolamine (amadori‐pe), a lipid‐linked glycation compound that is formed at an increased rate in hyperglycemic states, affected proliferation, migration and tube formation of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvec). amadori‐pe at a low concentration of less than 5 μm significantly enhanced these three factors involved in angiogenesis. furthermore, stimulation of huvec with amadori‐pe resulted in secretion of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (mmp‐2), a pivotal enzyme in the initial step of angiogenesis. our results demonstrated for the first time that amadori‐pe may be an important compound that promotes vascular disease as a result of its angiogenic activity on endothelial cells. we also demonstrated that mmp‐2 is a primary mediator of amadori‐pe‐driven angiogenesis.
activation of innate immunity to reduce lung metastases in breast cancer bacterial lipopolysaccharides (lps) stimulate mouse peritoneal macrophages to kill tumor cells in vitro. lysis is confined to tumor cells where it is nonspecific; both allogeneic and syngeneic cells being susceptible. stimulation by lps appears to be due to direct interaction between lps and macrophages and does not involve participation by lymphocytes. after exposure to lps, a latent period must elapse before macrophages can lyse tumor cells. the cytolytic mechanism requires contact between target cells and viable effector cells which maintain their lytic capacity for a sustained period and can kill on repeated occasions. the generation of a macrophage cytolytic effect by lps is critically dependent upon the absolute number of macrophages which must be sufficient to produce confluent monolayers. these findings indicate that lps stimulation of macrophages in vitro represents a valuable model system for the study of the mechanisms of macrophage stimulation and of the mediation of tumor cell death.
the kunitz-like modulatory protein haemangin is vital for hard tick blood-feeding success in recent years, the basement membrane (bm) — a specialized form of extracellular matrix (ecm) — has been recognized as an important regulator of cell behaviour, rather than just a structural feature of tissues. the bm mediates tissue compartmentalization and sends signals to epithelial cells about the external microenvironment. the bm is also an important structural and functional component of blood vessels, constituting an extracellular microenvironment sensor for endothelial cells and pericytes. vascular bm components have recently been found to be involved in the regulation of tumour angiogenesis, making them attractive candidate targets for potential cancer therapies.
cpla2-interacting protein, plip, causes apoptosis and decreases g1 phase in mesangial cells. abstract the group iv cytosolic phospholipase a2(cpla2) has been localized to the nucleus (m. r. sierra-honigmann, j. r. bradley, and j. s. pober, lab. investig. 74:684–695, 1996) and is known to translocate from the cytosolic compartment to the nuclear membrane (s. glover, m. s. de carvalho, t. bayburt, m. jonas, e. chi, c. c. leslie, and m. h. gelb, j. biol. chem. 270:15359–15367, 1995; a. r. schievella, m. k. regier, w. l. smith, and l. l. lin, j. biol. chem. 270:30749–30754, 1995). we hypothesized that nuclear proteins interact with cpla2 and participate in the functional effects of this translocation. we have identified a nuclear protein, cpla2-interacting protein (plip), a splice variant of human tip60, which interacts with the amino terminal region of cpla2. like tip60, plip cdna includes the myst domain containing a c2hc zinc finger and well-conserved similarities to acetyltransferases. both plip and tip60 coimmunoprecipitate and colocalize with cpla2 within the nuclei of transfected cos cells. a polyclonal antibody raised to plip recognizes both plip and tip60. endogenous tip60 and/or plip in rat mesangial cells is localized to the nucleus in response to serum deprivation. nuclear localization coincides temporally with apoptosis. plip expression, mediated by adenoviral gene transfer, potentiates serum deprivation-induced prostaglandin e2 (pge2) production and apoptosis in mouse mesangial cells from cpla2 +/+ mice but not in mesangial cells derived from cpla2 −/− mice. thus plip, a splice variant of tip60, interacts with cpla2 and potentiates cpla2-mediated pge2 production and apoptosis.
construction of a taste-blind medaka fish and quantitative assay of its preference–aversion behavior in mammals, taste perception is a major mode of sensory input. we have identified a novel family of 40-80 human and rodent g protein-coupled receptors expressed in subsets of taste receptor cells of the tongue and palate epithelia. these candidate taste receptors (t2rs) are organized in the genome in clusters and are genetically linked to loci that influence bitter perception in mice and humans. notably, a single taste receptor cell expresses a large repertoire of t2rs, suggesting that each cell may be capable of recognizing multiple tastants. t2rs are exclusively expressed in taste receptor cells that contain the g protein alpha subunit gustducin, implying that they function as gustducin-linked receptors. in the accompanying paper, we demonstrate that t2rs couple to gustducin in vitro, and respond to bitter tastants in a functional expression assay.
sor guidelines for concomitant chemoradiotherapy for patients with uterine cervical cancers: evidence update bulletin 2004. purpose to report mature results of a randomized trial that compared extended-field radiotherapy (efrt) versus pelvic radiotherapy with concomitant fluorouracil and cisplatin (ctrt) in women with locoregionally advanced carcinomas of the uterine cervix.   patients and methods four hundred three women with cervical cancer were randomly assigned to receive either efrt or ctrt. patients were eligible if they had stage iib to iva disease, stage ib to iia disease with a tumor diameter > or = 5 cm, or positive pelvic lymph nodes. patients were stratified by stage and by method of lymph node evaluation.   results the median follow-up time for 228 surviving patients was 6.6 years. the overall survival rate for patients treated with ctrt was significantly greater than that for patients treated with efrt (67% v 41% at 8 years; p <.0001). there was an overall reduction in the risk of disease recurrence of 51% (95% ci, 36% to 66%) for patients who received ctrt. patients with stage ib to iib disease who received ctrt had better overall and disease-free survival than those treated with efrt (p <.0001); 116 patients with stage iii to iva disease had better disease-free survival (p =.05) and a trend toward better overall survival (p =.07) if they were randomly assigned to ctrt. the rate of serious late complications of treatment was similar for the two treatment arms.   conclusion mature analysis confirms that the addition of fluorouracil and cisplatin to radiotherapy significantly improved the survival rate of women with locally advanced cervical cancer without increasing the rate of late treatment-related side effects.
dynamics of photogenerated holes in surface modified α-fe2o3 photoanodes for solar water splitting transient absorption spectroscopy on the μs-s time scale is used to monitor the yield and decay dynamics of photogenerated holes in nanocrystalline hematite photoanodes. in the absence of a positive applied bias, these holes are observed to undergo rapid electron-hole recombination. the application of a positive bias results in the generation of long-lived (3 ± 1 s lifetime) photoholes.
ghrelin cells in the gastrointestinal tract ghrelin, an acylated peptide produced predominantly in the stomach, stimulates feeding and gh secretion via interactions with the gh secretagogue type 1a receptor (ghs-r1a), the functionally active form of the ghs-r. ghrelin molecules exist in the stomach and hypothalamus as two major endogenous forms, a form acylated at serine 3 (ghrelin) and a des-acylated form (des-acyl ghrelin). acylation is indispensable for the binding of ghrelin to the ghs-r1a. ghrelin enhances feeding via the neuronal pathways of neuropeptide y and orexin, which act as orexigenic peptides in the hypothalamus. we here studied the effect of des-acyl ghrelin on feeding behavior. intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of rat des-acyl ghrelin to rats or mice fed ad libitum stimulated feeding during the light phase; neither ip nor icv administration of des-acyl ghrelin to fasting mice suppressed feeding. the icv administration of des-acyl ghrelin induced the expression of fos, a marker of neuronal activation, in orexin-expressing neurons of the lateral hypothalamic area, but not neuropeptide y-expressing neurons of the arcuate nucleus. peripheral administration of des-acyl ghrelin to rats or mice did not affect feeding. although icv administration of ghrelin did not induce food intake in ghs-r-deficient mice, it did in orexin-deficient mice. in contrast, icv administration of des-acyl ghrelin stimulated feeding in ghs-r-deficient mice, but not orexin-deficient mice. des-acyl ghrelin increased the intracellular calcium concentrations in isolated orexin neurons. central des-acyl ghrelin may activate orexin-expressing neurons, perhaps functioning in feeding regulation through interactions with a target protein distinct from the ghs-r.
attentional and nonattentional forms of sequence learning how is complex sequential material acquired, processed, and represented when there is no intention to learn? two experiments exploring a choice reaction time task are reported. unknown to ss, successive stimuli followed a sequence derived from a "noisy" finite-state grammar. after considerable practice (60,000 exposures) with experiment 1, ss acquired a complex body of procedural knowledge about the sequential structure of the material. experiment 2 was an attempt to identify limits on ss ability to encode the temporal context by using more distant contingencies that spanned irrelevant material. taken together, the results indicate that ss become increasingly sensitive to the temporal context set by previous elements of the sequence, up to 3 elements. responses are also affected by priming effects from recent trials. a connectionist model that incorporates sensitivity to the sequential structure and to priming effects is shown to capture key aspects of both acquisition and processing and to account for the interaction between attention and sequence structure reported by cohen, ivry, and keele (1990).
differential expression of enzymes associated with serine/glycine metabolism in different breast cancer subtypes identification of the factors critical to the tumor-initiating cell (tic) state may open new avenues in cancer therapy. here we show that the metabolic enzyme glycine decarboxylase (gldc) is critical for tics in non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc). tics from primary nsclc tumors express high levels of the oncogenic stem cell factor lin28b and gldc, which are both required for tic growth and tumorigenesis. overexpression of gldc and other glycine/serine enzymes, but not catalytically inactive gldc, promotes cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. we found that gldc induces dramatic changes in glycolysis and glycine/serine metabolism, leading to changes in pyrimidine metabolism to regulate cancer cell proliferation. in the clinic, aberrant activation of gldc correlates with poorer survival in lung cancer patients, and aberrant gldc expression is observed in multiple cancer types. this link between glycine metabolism and tumorigenesis may provide novel targets for advancing anticancer therapy.
native vietnamese medicinal plants with anti-atopic dermatitis activity: a systematic review licorice (glycyrrhiza glabra l., leguminosae) is frequently used in traditional medicine to treat inflammatory and allergic diseases. in this study, the main components (glycyrrhizin, 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid, isoliquiritin, and liquiritigenin) were isolated from licorice, and their anti-allergic effects, such as antiscratching behavior and ige production-inhibitory activity, were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. liquiritigenin and 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid most potently inhibited the degranulation of rbl-2h3 cells induced by ige with the antigen (dnp-hsa) and rat peritoneal mast cells induced by compound 48/80. liquiritigenin and 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid potently inhibited the passive cutaneous anaphylactic reaction as well as the scratching behavior in mice induced by compound 48/80. these components inhibited the production of ige in ovalbumin-induced asthma mice but liquiritigenin had little effect. this suggests that the antiallergic effects of licorice are mainly due to glycyrrhizin, 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid, and liquiritigenin, which can relieve ige-induced allergic diseases such as dermatitis and asthma.
comparing mental health of school-age children of parents with/without bipolar disorders: a case control study background to examine the risk for psychopathology in offspring at risk for bipolar disorder and the course of psychiatric disorders in these youth.   methods using structured diagnostic interviews (structured clinical interview for dsm-iv [scid] and kiddie schedule for affective disorders and schizophrenia [k-sads]), psychiatric diagnoses of 117 nonreferred offspring of parents with diagnosed bipolar disorder were compared with those of 171 age- and gender-matched offspring of parents without bipolar disorder or major depression.   results compared with offspring of parents without mood disorders, high-risk youth had elevated rates of major depression and bipolar disorder, anxiety, and disruptive behavior disorders. high-risk offspring also had significantly more impaired global assessment of functioning (gaf) scores, higher rates of psychiatric treatment, and higher rates of placement in special education classes. disruptive behavior disorders, separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (gad), social phobia, and depression tended to have their onset in early or middle childhood, whereas bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd), panic disorder, and substance use disorder had onset most frequently in adolescence.   conclusions these findings support the hypothesis that offspring of parents with bipolar disorder are at significantly increased risk for developing a wide range of severe psychiatric disorders and accompanying dysfunction. early disruptive behavior and anxiety disorders, as well as early-onset depression, may be useful markers of risk for subsequent bipolar disorder in high-risk samples.
prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders and rheumatic diseases in the indigenous qom population of rosario, argentina objective. the preclinical period of rheumatoid arthritis (ra) is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies such as anticitrullinated protein antibodies (acpa) and rheumatoid factor (rf). little is known about the joint symptom profile preceding onset of ra, and whether symptoms are associated with ra autoantibodies. because first-degree relatives (fdr) of north american native (nan) ra probands exhibit multiple risk factors for development of future ra, we investigated the prevalence of joint symptoms in this high-risk population. methods. we studied 306 fdr of nan patients with ra, 323 nan controls (nc), and 293 white controls (wc) having no family history of autoimmune diseases. study subjects completed a questionnaire that asked whether they had pain, swelling, or morning stiffness in their hand joints, or in other joints. serum samples were gathered at the same time and tested for the presence of acpa, rf, and high-sensitivity c-reactive protein levels. results. in all cases, fdr were significantly more likely to report experiencing joint symptoms compared to the 2 control groups. fdr also exhibited a significantly higher prevalence of ra autoantibodies than the control groups. there were modest trends for joint symptoms to associate with ra autoantibodies, and individuals who were both acpa-positive and rf-positive had the highest prevalence of joint symptoms. conclusion. fdr of nan patients with ra have a higher prevalence of joint symptoms compared to individuals with no family history of autoimmune disease. this finding is only partially explained by a high prevalence of ra autoantibodies in the fdr.
rack1, a multifaceted scaffolding protein: structure and function background: peripheral anionic site (pas) blockade of acetylcholinesterase (ache) notably affects neuronal activity and cyto-architecture, however, the mechanism(s) involved are incompletely understood. objective: we wished to specify the pas extracellular effects on specific ache mrna splice variants, delineate the consequent cellular remodeling events, and explore the inhibitory effects on interchanging rack1 interactions. methods: we exposed rat hippocampal cultured neurons to bw284c51, the peripheral anionic site inhibitor of ache, and to the non-selective ache active site inhibitor, physostigmine for studying the neuronal remodeling of ache mrna expression and trafficking. results: bw284c51 induced overexpression of both ache splice variants, yet promoted neuritic translocation of the normally rare ache-r, and retraction of ache-s mrna in an antisense-suppressible manner. bw284c51 further caused modest decreases in the expression of the scaffold protein rack1 (receptor for activated protein kinase βii), followed by drastic neurite retraction of both rack1 and the ache homologue neuroligin1, but not the tubulin-associated map2 protein. accompanying bw284c51 effects involved decreases in the fyn kinase and membrane insertion of the glutamate receptor nr2b variant and impaired glutamatergic activities of treated cells. intriguingly, molecular modeling suggested that direct, non-catalytic competition with fyn binding by the rack1-interacting ache-r variant may be involved. conclusions: our findings highlight complex neuronal ache-r/rack1 interactions and are compatible with the hypothesis that peripheral site ache inhibitors induce rack1-mediated neuronal remodeling, promoting suppressed glutamatergic neurotransmission.
genomic characterization of group c orthobunyavirus reference strains and recent south american clinical isolates bunyaviruses are a large family of segmented rna viruses which, like influenza virus, use a cap-snatching mechanism for transcription whereby short capped primers derived by endonucleolytic cleavage of host mrnas are used by the viral rna-dependent rna polymerase (l-protein) to transcribe viral mrnas. it was recently shown that the cap-snatching endonuclease of influenza virus resides in a discrete n-terminal domain of the pa polymerase subunit. here we structurally and functionally characterize a similar endonuclease in la crosse orthobunyavirus (lacv) l-protein. we expressed n-terminal fragments of the lacv l-protein and found that residues 1-180 have metal binding and divalent cation dependent nuclease activity analogous to that of influenza virus endonuclease. the 2.2 å resolution x-ray crystal structure of the domain confirms that lacv and influenza endonucleases have similar overall folds and identical two metal binding active sites. the in vitro activity of the lacv endonuclease could be abolished by point mutations in the active site or by binding 2,4-dioxo-4-phenylbutanoic acid (dpba), a known influenza virus endonuclease inhibitor. a crystal structure with bound dpba shows the inhibitor chelating two active site manganese ions. the essential role of this endonuclease in cap-dependent transcription was demonstrated by the loss of transcriptional activity in a rnp reconstitution system in cells upon making the same point mutations in the context of the full-length lacv l-protein. using structure based sequence alignments we show that a similar endonuclease almost certainly exists at the n-terminus of l-proteins or pa polymerase subunits of essentially all known negative strand and cap-snatching segmented rna viruses including arenaviruses (2 segments), bunyaviruses (3 segments), tenuiviruses (4–6 segments), and orthomyxoviruses (6–8 segments). this correspondence, together with the well-known mapping of the conserved polymerase motifs to the central regions of the l-protein and influenza pb1 subunit, suggests that l-proteins might be architecturally, and functionally equivalent to a concatemer of the three orthomyxovirus polymerase subunits in the order pa-pb1-pb2. furthermore, our structure of a known influenza endonuclease inhibitor bound to lacv endonuclease suggests that compounds targeting a potentially broad spectrum of segmented rna viruses, several of which are serious or emerging human, animal and plant pathogens, could be developed using structure-based optimisation.
cytochrome p450 and abcb1 genetics: association with quetiapine and norquetiapine plasma and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations and with clinical response in patients suffering from schizophrenia. a pilot study authors' objectives the main objectives were to assess the clinical effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of 'atypical' antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia in comparison with conventional antipsychotic drugs, placebo and other atypical antipsychotic drugs. the secondary objectives of the review were to investigate response in those with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, with predominantly negative symptoms or experiencing their first episode of schizophrenia.
patient-related factors and complications after arthroscopic tenotomy of the long head of the biceps tendon background arthroscopic management has been recommended for some superior labrum anterior and posterior (slap) lesions, but no studies have focused on patients over 50 years of age with rotator cuff tear and a type ii slap lesion. hypothesis in patients over 50 years of age with an arthroscopically confirmed lesion of the rotator cuff and a type ii slap lesion, there is no difference between (1) repair of both lesions and (2) repair of the rotator cuff tear without repair of the slap ii lesion but with a tenotomy of the long head of the biceps. study design randomized controlled clinical trial; level of evidence, 1. methods we recruited 63 patients. in 31 patients, we repaired the rotator cuff and the type ii slap lesion (group 1). in the other 32 patients, we repaired the rotator cuff and tenotomized the long head of the biceps (group 2). seven patients (2 in group 1 and 5 in group 2) were lost to final follow-up. results at a minimum 2.9 years’ follow-up, statistically significant differences were seen with respect to the university of california, los angeles (ucla) score and range of motion values. in group 1 (slap repair and rotator cuff repair), the ucla showed a statistically significant improvement from a preoperative average rating of 10.4 (range, 6–14) to an average of 27.9 (range, 24–35) postoperatively (p < .001). in group 2 (biceps tenotomy and rotator cuff repair), the ucla showed a statistically significant improvement from a preoperative average rating of 10.1 (range, 5–14) to an average of 32.1 (range, 30–35) postoperatively (p < .001) there was a statistically significant difference in total postoperative ucla scores and range of motion when comparing the 2 groups postoperatively (p < .05). conclusions there are no advantages in repairing a type ii slap lesion when associated with a rotator cuff tear in patients over 50 years of age. the association of rotator cuff repair and biceps tenotomy provides better clinical outcome compared with repair of the type ii slap lesion and the rotator cuff.
ischemic stroke associated with cough and cold preparation containing methylephedrine and supplement containing chinese herbal drugs. background dietary supplements that contain ephedra alkaloids (sometimes called ma huang) are widely promoted and used in the united states as a means of losing weight and increasing energy. in the light of recently reported adverse events related to use of these products, the food and drug administration (fda) has proposed limits on the dose and duration of use of such supplements. the fda requested an independent review of reports of adverse events related to the use of supplements that contained ephedra alkaloids to assess causation and to estimate the level of risk the use of these supplements poses to consumers.   methods we reviewed 140 reports of adverse events related to the use of dietary supplements containing ephedra alkaloids that were submitted to the fda between june 1, 1997, and march 31, 1999. a standardized rating system for assessing causation was applied to each adverse event.   results thirty-one percent of cases were considered to be definitely or probably related to the use of supplements containing ephedra alkaloids, and 31 percent were deemed to be possibly related. among the adverse events that were deemed definitely, probably, or possibly related to the use of supplements containing ephedra alkaloids, 47 percent involved cardiovascular symptoms and 18 percent involved the central nervous system. hypertension was the single most frequent adverse effect (17 reports), followed by palpitations, tachycardia, or both (13); stroke (10); and seizures (7). ten events resulted in death, and 13 events produced permanent disability, representing 26 percent of the definite, probable, and possible cases.   conclusions the use of dietary supplements that contain ephedra alkaloids may pose a health risk to some persons. these findings indicate the need for a better understanding of individual susceptibility to the adverse effects of such dietary supplements.
in vitro effectiveness of acidic and alkline solutions on scolices of hydatid cyst hydatid disease is a parasitic disease that is treated primarily by surgery. the most important complication of surgical treatment is spillage of the contents of the cyst, leading to secondary dissemination. in this study, the effect of chlorhexidine gluconate (chx-glu) was investigated in the treatment of experimental intraperitoneal hydatidosis (iph). iph was reproduced in 100 wistar albino rats by inoculation with 1 ml of a suspension contained approximately 1500 viable protoscolices of echinococcus granulosus following determination of scolicidal activity of chlorhexidine gluconate in vitro. five minutes after protoscolex inoculation, 5 ml of the scolicidal solution was instilled into the peritoneal cavity: 0.9% nacl (control group), 4.0% chx-glu, 0.4% chx-glu, and 0.04% chx-glu. after 6 months of follow-up, the rats were sacrificed, and the number of isolated cysts, peroperative and postoperative deaths, and toxicity were evaluated. cyst formation did not occur in any of the chx-glu groups compared to the control group (p < 0.05), whereas it was detected in all of the control rats. in addition, to 4.0% chx-glu was found to be more toxic and to cause a high mortality rate compared to the 0.4% and 0.04% chx-glu groups and the control group (p < 0.05). chx-glu 0.04% was found to be the most potent, nontoxic agent; it is easily available, inexpensive, and highly potent in a short period of time at the low concentration. chx-glu 0.04% can be used safely in the treatment of intraperitoneal hydatidosis and hydatid cyst.

prolactin-stimulated survivin induction is required for beta cell mass expansion during pregnancy in mice objective—diabetes results from a deficiency of functional β-cells due to both an increase in β-cell death and an inhibition of β-cell replication. the molecular mechanisms responsible for these effects in susceptible individuals are mostly unknown. the objective of this study was to determine whether a gene critical for cell division and cell survival in cancer cells, survivin, might also be important for β-cells. research design and methods—we generated mice harboring a conditional deletion of survivin in pancreatic endocrine cells using mice with a pax-6-cre transgene promoter construct driving tissue-specific expression of cre-recombinase in these cells. we performed metabolic studies and immunohistochemical analyses to determine the effects of a mono- and biallelic deletion of survivin. results—selective deletion of survivin in pancreatic endocrine cells in the mouse had no discernible effects during embryogenesis but was associated with striking decreases in β-cell number after birth, leading to hyperglycemia and early-onset diabetes by 4 weeks of age. serum insulin levels were significantly decreased in animals lacking endocrine cell survivin, with relative stability of other hormones. exogenous expression of survivin in mature β-cells lacking endogenous survivin completely rescued the hyperglycemic phenotype and the decrease in β-cell mass, confirming the specificity of the survivin effect in these cells. conclusions—our findings implicate survivin in the maintenance of β-cell mass through both replication and antiapoptotic mechanisms. given the widespread involvement of survivin in cancer, a novel role for survivin may well be exploited in β-cell regulation in diseased states, such as diabetes.
suspected spontaneous reports of birth defects in the uk associated with the use of carbimazole and propylthiouracil in pregnancy maternal thyrotoxicosis, predominantly secondary to graves' disease, affects 0.2% of all pregnancies. the endocrine society guidelines recommend the use of propylthiouracil as a first-line drug for thyrotoxicosis in pregnancy because of associations between carbimazole or methimazole and congenital anomalies. however, recent studies have highlighted the risk of severe liver injury with propylthiouracil. here, we report another case with multiple congenital anomalies following in utero exposure to carbimazole and review the literature to consider the risks and benefits of available pharmacological treatments for thyrotoxicosis in pregnancy.
linking supply to demand: the neuronal monocarboxylate transporter mct2 and the α‐amino‐3‐hydroxyl‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazole‐propionic acid receptor glur2/3 subunit are associated in a common trafficking process ampa receptors mediate the majority of the fast excitatory transmission in the central nervous system. much evidence suggests that the fast trafficking of ampa receptors into and out of the postsynaptic membrane underlies changes in synaptic strength thought to be necessary for higher cognitive functions such as learning and memory. despite the abundance of research conducted in this area, a direct, real-time functional assay that measures the trafficking of native ampa receptors has been lacking. toward this aim, we use a photoreactive, irreversible antagonist of ampa receptors, anqx, to rapidly silence surface ampa receptors and investigate directly the trafficking of native ampa receptors in real time. we find that the most dynamic movement of ampa receptors occurs by lateral movement across the surface of neurons. fast cycling of surface ampa receptors with receptors from internal stores does occur but exclusively at extrasynaptic somatic sites. the cycling of synaptic ampa receptors only occurs on a much longer timescale with complete exchange requiring at least 16 hr. this cycling is not dependent on protein synthesis or action potential driven network activity. these data suggest a revised model of ampa receptor trafficking wherein a large internal store of ampa receptors exchanges rapidly with extrasynaptic somatic ampa receptors, and these newly inserted ampa receptors then travel laterally along dendrites to reside stably at synapses.
insulin-like growth factor-i correlates more closely than growth hormone with insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in patients with acromegaly unlabelled insulin resistance (ir) can be induced by high amounts of growth hormone (gh).   aim to set up, in acromegaly without diabetes mellitus, a correlation between the disease activity in gh-secreting adenoma (aa) - assessed by minimum gh serum level during an oral glucose tolerance test (ogtt) - and severity of insulin resistance (ir), assessed by homa-ir index.   methods 75 out of 88 consecutive patients with acromegaly hospitalized in our department were included in this study. 13 patients proved to have diabetes mellitus and were excluded. serum glucose, gh and insulin levels were measured by immunoradiometricassay basal and at 30, 60 and 120 minutes after a 75 g ogtt in 88 patients with active or cured acromegaly. ir was assessed using homa-ir index (homa-ir=basal serum glucose (mg/dl) x basal serum insulin (mu/l)/22.5 x 18). a value over 2.5 was considered indicating ir.   results out of 75 patients without diabetes mellitus, 36 subjects (48%) were presenting with ir (34 with active disease, 2 cured). we found a significant positive correlation (r=0.56, p<0.001) between aa and homa-ir. the gh minimal level corresponding to the intersection of the exponential regression curve with the homa-ir level of 2.5 was 8.8 ng/ml, a cut-off point indicating ir with 82% specificity and 78% sensitivity. the odds ratio for developing ir becomes significant at a minimum gh level during ogtt of 2 ng/ml (odds ratio 7.6, 95% confidence interval 2-29).   conclusions the severity of ir revealed by acromegaly correlates with gh production. a gh serum level higher than 2 ng/ml during ogtt indicates an increased risk for developing ir. this cut-off level of gh can be used as one of criteria of cured disease, regarding the lack of metabolic effects.
validation, repeatability and reproducibility of a noninvasive instrument for measuring thoracic and lumbar curvature of the spine in the sagittal plane. study design an observational study in which vertebral centroid measurement of lumbar lordosis, developed in this study, was used to examine lumbar curvature. the intra- and interobserver reliability of the vertebral centroid measurement of lumbar lordosis and the cobb technique were compared.   objectives to evaluate the reliability of a new method of measuring lumbar lordosis and to examine the changes in the lordotic curve from 0 degree to 90 degrees flexion of the trunk.   summary of background data several different methods are used to measure lumbar lordosis. the cobb technique, based on measurement of vertebral endplates, is the method most frequently adopted for clinical diagnosis. however, because of the variations in the vertebral endplate architecture, the vertebral surface angle is difficult to identify. this reduces the reliability of the cobb technique.   methods lateral radiographs of 16 study participants were taken from the upright position to a trunk flexion of 90 degrees in 30 degrees increments. the lumbar lordotic curve was measured by three observers individually using two applications of the traditional cobb technique and the vertebral centroid measurement of lumbar lordosis.   results correlation coefficients of lumbar lordosis between the two methods ranged from 0.589 to 0.772 with participants standing upright (all p < 0.05). interobserver reliability coefficients were 0.903 for vertebral centroid measurement of lumbar lordosis, 0.826 for cobb (l1-l5), and 0.784 for cobb (l1-s1), although the three measurements all revealed an excellent intraobserver reproducibility (r greater than 0.9). the vertebral centroid measurement of lumbar lordosis showed the smallest mean absolute differences between any two observers' measurements (< 1.7 degrees).   conclusions the findings from this study indicate that the vertebral centroid measurement of lumbar lordosis is more reliable than the cobb method for assessing lumbar lordosis. the vertebral centroid measurement of lumbar lordosis also can be used to evaluate the actual lumbar curvature in outline at various angles of trunk flexion.
identification of genetic diversity of hepatitis e virus (hev) and determination of the seroprevalence of hev in eastern china the prevalence of anti‐hev was assessed in 2,233 subjects aged 20–79 years in the republic of san marino in the years 1990–1991. the sera were tested by elisa and further confirmed by western blot (wb) analysis. the overall anti‐hev prevalence was 1.5%. a significant trend by age was observed. anti‐hev prevalence was 0.6% in subjects <30 years and 3.3% in those older than 70 years of age. family size larger than four persons (or = 3.8; 95% ci = 1.8–13.2) was the sole independent predictor of anti‐hev positivity in the multivariate analysis. anti‐hav and anti‐hev prevalences did not show a parallel trend by age. no association was found either between hepatitis e virus (hev) or hepatitis c virus (hcv) infections. follow‐up samples 5 years apart were available for 38 out of 54 (70%) anti‐hev elisa‐positive subjects. eight out of 22 (37%) wb‐confirmed anti‐hev–positive subjects were still anti‐hev–positive after 5 years. however, anti‐hev remained positive in all but two (75%) of the subjects with wb‐confirmed elisa positivity value of s/co ≥ 2 (cutoff 1.2), but in only 2 out of the 14 subjects (14%) with a wb‐con‐ firmed elisa positivity value of s/co < 2 (p < 0.005). none of the 16 subjects elisa‐positive but not wb‐confirmed was anti‐hev–positive 5 years apart. therefore, only a relative proportion of subjects once infected with hev maintain for at least 5 years anti‐hev antibodies. j. med. virol. 58:49–53, 1999. © 1999 wiley‐liss, inc.
identification of genes upregulated by the transcription factor bcr1 that are involved in impermeability, impenetrability, and drug resistance of candida albicans a/α biofilms abstract although the fungus candida albicans is a commensal colonizer of humans, the organism is also an important opportunistic pathogen. most infections caused by c. albicans arise from organisms that were previously colonizing the host as commensals, and therefore successful establishment of colonization is a prerequisite for pathogenicity. to elucidate fungal activities that promote colonization, an analysis of the transcription profile of c. albicans cells recovered from the intestinal tracts of mice was performed. the results showed that within the c. albicans colonizing population, cells expressed genes characteristic of the laboratory-grown exponential phase and genes characteristic of post-exponential-phase cells. thus, gene expression both promoted the ability to grow rapidly (a characteristic of exponential-phase cells) and enhanced the ability to resist stresses (a characteristic of post-exponential-phase cells). similarities in gene expression in commensal colonizing cells and cells invading host tissue during disease were found, showing that c. albicans cells adopt a particular cell surface when growing within a host in both situations. in addition, transcription factors cph2p and tec1p were shown to regulate c. albicans gene expression during intestinal colonization.
the effect of foot orthoses and in-shoe wedges during cycling: a systematic review to validate the measurement of peak power output (ppo) using a short cycling sprint test (inertial load (il) test), we compare it to the widely accepted wingate anaerobic test (want). fifteen healthy, young, active subjects performed 2 experimental trials. in each trial, subjects warmed up and sprinted 4 times for the il test. after recovery, they cycled for 30 s at maximum capacity for the want. the experimental trial was replicated 3 d later to test for reliability. inter- and intra-day ppo measured with the il test was very reliable (r(1) = 0.99 and r(1) = 0.94, respectively). the correlation between the il and want was highly significant (r = 0.82; p < 0.001), although the absolute ppo values were markedly higher for the il test (1268 +/- 41 w vs. 786 +/- 27 w; p < 0.001). in conclusion, cycling ppo can be validly assessed with the il test. the higher ppo attained with an il test could be related to better identification of peak power, since both velocity and resistance are free to vary during the sprint in comparison with the want, where resistance is fixed. owing to the short duration of the sprint (4 s) and high intra-day reliability despite a short recovery time (180 s), the il test is optimal for repeated measurements of anaerobic performance.
shiga toxigenic and enteropathogenic escherichia coli in water and fish from pay‐to‐fish ponds we have isolated one sorbitol-nonfermenting (snf) escherichia coli o157:h7 isolate and five sorbitolfermenting (sf) e. coli o157:h isolates that do not contain shiga toxin (stx) genes (stx). isolates originated from patients with diarrhea (n 5 4) and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (hus) (n 5 2). all isolates harbored a chromosomal eae gene encoding gamma-intimin as well as the plasmid genes e-hly and etp. the e. coli o157:h7 isolate was katp and espp positive. respective sera obtained from the patient with hus contained antibodies to the o157 lipopolysaccharide antigen. the stx-negative e. coli o157:h7 isolate is genetically related to stx-positive snf e. coli o157:h7. all stx-negative sf e. coli o157:h isolates belong to the same genetic cluster and are closely related to stx-positive sf e. coli o157:h isolates. our data indicate that stx-negative e. coli o157: h7/h variants may occur at a low frequency and cannot be recognized by diagnostic methods that target stx.
tocolysis for inhibiting preterm birth in extremely preterm birth, multiple gestations and in growth-restricted fetuses: a systematic review and meta-analysis we sought to estimate the effect of indomethacin on duration of pregnancy in women with dilated cervix between 14 (0)/ (7) to 25 (6)/ (7) weeks. demographics, risk factors, and outcomes were compared in women 14 (0)/ (7) to 25 (6)/ (7) weeks with a dilated cervix > or = 1 cm who received indomethacin versus no indomethacin therapy, stratified for cerclage. primary outcome was interval from presentation until delivery. of 222 singleton gestations, 68 (31%) received indomethacin. in unadjusted and adjusted analyses, no significant differences were observed in interval from presentation to delivery and preterm birth < 28, < 32, or < 35 weeks comparing the indomethacin and no indomethacin groups, even after stratification for cerclage. in multivariate logistic regression analysis limited to women receiving cerclage, preterm birth < 32 weeks (odds ratio 0.56, 95% confidence interval 0.26, 1.25) and < 35 weeks (odds ratio 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.23, 1.14) suggested a possible but not significant benefit for indomethacin use. indomethacin therapy in women with dilated cervix at 14 (0)/ (7) to 25 (6)/ (7) weeks, regardless of cerclage or not, had no effect on pregnancy outcomes.
humic acid decreases acute toxicity and ventilation frequency in eastern rainbowfish (melanotaenia splendida splendida) exposed to acid mine drainage. humic substances (hs) have been shown to decrease the toxicity of environmental stressors, but knowledge of their ability to influence the toxicity of multiple stressors such as metal mixtures and low ph associated with acid mine drainage (amd) is still limited. the present study investigated the ability of hs to decrease toxicity of amd to mayflies (atalophlebia spp.). the amd was collected from the mount morgan (mount morgan, queensland, australia) open pit. mayflies were exposed to concentrations of amd at 0%, 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4% in the presence of 0 mg/l, 10 mg/l, and 20 mg/l aldrich humic acid (aha). a u-shaped response was noted in all aha treatments, with higher rates of mortality recorded in the 2% and 3% dilutions compared with 4%. this result was linked with increased precipitates in the lower concentrations. a follow-up trial showed significantly higher concentrations of precipitates in the 2% and 3% amd dilutions in the 0 mg/l aha treatment and higher precipitates in the 2% amd, 10 mg/l and 20 mg/l aha, treatments. humic substances were shown to significantly increase survival of mayflies exposed to amd by up to 50% in the 20 mg/l aha treatment. humic substances may have led to increased survival after amd exposure through its ability to influence animal physiology and complex heavy metals. these results are valuable in understanding the ability of hs to influence the toxicity of multiple stressors.
mutational analyses of c-flipr, the only murine short flip isoform, reveal requirements for disc recruitment death receptor signaling is initiated by the assembly of the deathinducing signaling complex, which culminates in the activation of the initiator caspase, either caspase-8 or caspase-10. a family of viral and cellular proteins, known as flip, plays an essential role in the regulation of death receptor signaling. viral flip (v-flip) and short cellular flip (c-flips) inhibit apoptosis by interfering with death receptor signaling. the structure and mechanisms of v-flip and c-flips remain largely unknown. here we report a high resolution crystal structure of mc159, a v-flip derived from the molluscum contagiosum virus, which is a member of the human poxvirus family. unexpectedly, the two tandem death effector domains (deds) of mc159 rigidly associate with each other through a hydrophobic interface. structure-based sequence analysis suggests that this interface is conserved in the tandem deds from other v-flip, c-flips, and caspase-8 and -10. strikingly, the overall packing arrangement between the two deds of mc159 resembles that between the caspase recruitment domains of apaf-1 and caspase-9. in addition, each ded of mc159 contains a highly conserved binding motif on the surface, to which loss-of-function mutations in mc159 map. these observations, in conjunction with published evidence, reveal significant insights into the function of v-flip and suggest a mechanism by which v-flip and c-flips inhibit death receptor signaling.
an investigation into the factors of adoption of wireless applications for data management by nurses nearly two decades ago, british neurologist and author (awakenings and the man who mistook his wife for a hat), dr. oliver sacks, resolved health care’s current dilemma when he said: “there is only one cardinal rule in medicine: one must always listen to the patient.” if only it were that simple. and yet, for nursing—typically considered the “caring” constituency—it is that simple. problem is, nursing, as with every other health care constituency, has to serve several masters. the cruelest master of them all? the bottom line. unfortunately, nursing must all too often subjugate the ideal of listening to the patient to the reality of doing what is cost-effective. fortunately, there is a means to that ideal end—information technology (it).
high-level simulation for multiple fault injection evaluation abstract. we present some observations on public-key cryptosystems that use the chinese remaindering algorithm. our results imply that careless implementations of such systems could be vulnerable. only one faulty signature, in some explained context, is enough to recover the secret key.
use of telemedicine in spain — perceptions of patients , physicians , and pharmacists congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and hypertension are common causes of hospitalization in the elderly. short-term postdischarge clinical outcomes regarding compliance, symptom control, readmission, functional status, and mortality rates are in need of improvement. this observational study documents the results of a home-based case-managed telemedicine (cmtm) program delivered over a 2-month period postdischarge. a population of 851, predominantly elderly (over age 60), recently discharged patients were enrolled in the program. they received a nurse visit up to 3 times/week and home telemedicine monitoring (weight, blood pressure, pulse rate, blood glucose, and oximeter recordings) on a daily basis. patient education was provided by the nurse and reinforced through telemedicine. compliance rates, quality of life parameters, patient satisfaction with telemedicine, and data regarding nine quality of care measures (qcm), hospital readmission, and mortality rates were documented. patient demographics and outcomes of care were analyzed. there were 68% females and 56% african americans. the readmission rate was 13% and mortality 2%. treatment goals were met in 67%, patient compliance rate was 77%, and the average improvement in the nine qcm indicators was 66%. a majority of patients showed improved quality of health perception, better disease understanding, and high satisfaction rates with telemedicine. this is one of the larger observational studies in a predominantly elderly patient population enrolled in a cmtm program, to date. this model of care was well accepted by the elderly and produced excellent short-term clinical outcomes.
newborn care and knowledge translation - perceptions among primary healthcare staff in northern vietnam this randomized controlled study was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational program entitled 'capacity building for community leaders in a healthy living environment,' and to assess the usefulness of a participatory style of education and the applicability of an intersectoral approach in the educational process. an intervention group and a control group (consisting of 150 and 154 community leaders, respectively) were both evaluated, after the intervention group took part in a 5-day participatory-style educational program. healthy living environment promotion competency (hpc) was evaluated by an instrument consisted of four competency areas: identifying the steps required for a healthy living environment; understanding the principles to reduce potential health risks; providing public health management to improve the living environment; and applying the principles of health communication skills. scores between the intervention and control groups were examined to identify changes between the baseline and post-intervention periods. a qualitative evaluation of the educational program by participants and facilitators was conducted to assess the appropriateness of the intervention. the results indicated significant increases in the total hpc score and scores of individual hpc competency areas in the intervention group. thus, the effectiveness of a capacity building program for community leaders in a healthy living environment was demonstrated. qualitative evaluation revealed that the participatory-style and intersectoral collaboration approach facilitated the educational process. community leaders, who are representatives of various sectors and mass organizations within the community, can be important implementers in the promotion of a healthy living environment.
boule gene expression underpins the meiotic arrest in spermatogenesis in male rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss) exposed to dehp and butachlor. the deleted in azoospermia (daz) genes encode potential rna-binding proteins that are expressed exclusively in prenatal and postnatal germ cells and are strong candidates for human fertility factors. here we report the identification of an additional member of the daz gene family, which we have called boule. with the identification of this gene, it is clear that the human daz gene family contains at least three members: daz, a y-chromosome gene cluster that arose 30–40 million years ago and whose deletion is linked to infertility in men; dazl, the “father” of daz, a gene that maps to human chromosome 3 and has homologs required for both female and male germ cell development in other organisms; and boule, a gene that we propose is the “grandfather” of daz and maps to human chromosome 2. human and mouse boule resemble the invertebrate meiotic regulator boule, the proposed ortholog of daz, in sequence and expression pattern and hence likely perform a similar meiotic function. in contrast, the previously identified human daz and dazl are expressed much earlier than boule in prenatal germ stem cells and spermatogonia; dazl also is expressed in female germ cells. these data suggest that homologs of the daz gene family can be grouped into two subfamilies (boule and dazl) and that members of the daz family evolved from an ancestral meiotic regulator, boule, to assume distinct, yet overlapping, functions in germ cell development.
long distance movement of dir1 and investigation of the role of dir1-like during systemic acquired resistance in arabidopsis abietane diterpenoids are major constituents of conifer resins that have important industrial and medicinal applications. however, their function in plants is poorly understood. here we show that dehydroabietinal (da), an abietane diterpenoid, is an activator of systemic acquired resistance (sar), which is an inducible defense mechanism that is activated in the distal, non-colonized, organs of a plant that has experienced a local foliar infection. da was purified as a sar-activating factor from vascular sap of arabidopsis thaliana leaves treated with a sar-inducing microbe. locally applied da is translocated through the plant and systemically induces the accumulation of salicylic acid (sa), an important activator of defense, thus leading to enhanced resistance against subsequent infections. the npr1 (non-expressor of pr genes1), fmo1 (flavin-dependent monooxygenase1) and dir1 (defective in induced resistance1) genes, which are critical for biologically induced sar, are also required for the da-induced sar, which is further enhanced by azelaic acid, a defense priming molecule. in response to the biological induction of sar, da in vascular sap is redistributed into a sar-inducing 'signaling da' pool that is associated with a trypsin-sensitive high molecular weight fraction, a finding that suggests that da-orchestrated sar involves a vascular sap protein(s).
policy trap and optimal subsidization policy under limited supply of vaccines the term "herd immunity" is widely used but carries a variety of meanings. some authors use it to describe the proportion immune among individuals in a population. others use it with reference to a particular threshold proportion of immune individuals that should lead to a decline in incidence of infection. still others use it to refer to a pattern of immunity that should protect a population from invasion of a new infection. a common implication of the term is that the risk of infection among susceptible individuals in a population is reduced by the presence and proximity of immune individuals (this is sometimes referred to as "indirect protection" or a "herd effect"). we provide brief historical, epidemiologic, theoretical, and pragmatic public health perspectives on this concept.
sox2 up-regulation and glial cell proliferation following degeneration of spiral ganglion neurons in the adult mouse inner ear the mammalian cochlea is innervated by two classes of sensory neurons. type i neurons make up 90–95% of the cochlear nerve and contact single inner hair cells to provide acoustic analysis as we know it. in contrast, the far less numerous type ii neurons arborize extensively among outer hair cells (ohcs) and supporting cells. their scarcity and smaller calibre axons have made them the subject of much speculation, but little experimental progress for the past 50 years. here we record from type ii fibres near their terminal arbors under ohcs to show that they receive excitatory glutamatergic synaptic input. the type ii peripheral arbor conducts action potentials, but the small and infrequent glutamatergic excitation indicates a requirement for strong acoustic stimulation. furthermore, we show that type ii neurons are excited by atp. exogenous atp depolarized type ii neurons, both directly and by evoking glutamatergic synaptic input. these results prove that type ii neurons function as cochlear afferents, and can be modulated by atp. the lesser magnitude of synaptic drive dictates a fundamentally different role in auditory signalling from that of type i afferents.
adaptive reorganization of cortical networks in alzheimer’s disease background and purpose two mechanisms for recovery from aphasia, repair of damaged language networks and activation of compensatory areas, have been proposed. in this study, we investigated whether both mechanisms or one instead of the other take place in the brain of recovered aphasic patients.   methods using blood oxygenation level-dependent functional mri (fmri), we studied cortical language networks during lexical-semantic processing tasks in 7 right-handed aphasic patients at least 5 months after the onset of left-hemisphere stroke and had regained substantial language functions since then.   results we found that in the recovered aphasic patient group, functional language activity significantly increased in the right hemisphere and nonsignificantly decreased in the left hemisphere compared with that in the normal group. bilateral language networks resulted from partial restitution of damaged functions in the left hemisphere and activation of compensated (or recruited) areas in the right hemisphere. failure to restore any language function in the left hemisphere led to predominantly right hemispheric networks in some individuals. however, better language recovery, at least for lexical-semantic processing, was observed in individuals who had bilateral rather than right hemisphere-predominant networks.   conclusions the results indicate that the restoration of left-hemisphere language networks is associated with better recovery and inversely related to activity in the compensated or recruited areas of the right hemisphere.
bmpr2 loss in fibroblasts promotes mammary carcinoma metastasis via increased inflammation initiation of bmp signaling is dependent upon activation of type i bmp receptor by constitutively active type ii bmp receptor. three type ii bmp receptors have been identified; acvr2a and acvr2b serve as receptors for bmps and for activin‐like ligands whereas bmpr‐ii functions only as a bmp receptor. as bmp signaling is required for endochondral ossification and loss of either acvr2a or acvr2b is not associated with deficits in limb development, we hypothesized that bmpr‐ii would be essential for bmp signaling during skeletogenesis. we removed bmpr‐ii from early limb mesoderm by crossing bmpr‐ii floxed mice with those carrying the prx1‐cre transgene. mice lacking limb expression of bmpr‐ii have normal skeletons that could not be distinguished from control littermates. from these data, we conclude that bmpr‐ii is not required for endochondral ossification in the limb where loss of bmpr‐ii may be compensated by bmp utilization of acvr2a and acvr2b. genesis, 00:1‐6, 2011. © 2011 wiley‐liss, inc.
stress, behavioral arousal, and open field activity—a reexamination of emotionality in the rat the relationship of open-field behaviors (latency, ambulation, rearing, and defecation) and adrenal weight and adrenal ascorbic acid (aaa) was investigated. 38 male sprague-dawley rats received one daily trial in the open field for 4 days. measures of adrenal weight and aaa were subsequently obtained. correlations between variables indicated no meaningful relationship between emotional defecation and adrenal responses. rearing correlated significantly with aaa. latency was significantly related with adrenal weight. these results are consistent with recent studies investigating performance of emotional ss on escape-avoidance conditioning and cer behavior.
long-term leaf production response to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide and tropospheric ozone in this review i am drawing attention to some constraints and biases in co2 enrichment experiments and the analysis of data in the literature. conclusions drawn from experimental works differ when the data are grouped in a way such that the relative frequency of test conditions does not determine the emerging trends, for instance unrealistically strong co2-'fertilization' effects, which are in conflict with some basic ecological principles. i suggest separating three test conditions: uncoupled systems (plants not depending in a natural nutrient cycle) (i); expanding systems, in which plants are given ample space and time to explore otherwise limited resources (ii); and fully coupled systems in which the natural nutrient cycling governs growth at steady-state leaf area index (lai) and fine root renewal (iii). data for 10 type iii experiments yield rather moderate effects of elevated co2 on plant biomass production, if any. in steady-state grassland, the effects are water-related; in closed tree stands, initial effects decline rapidly with time. plant-soil coupling (soil conditions) deserves far greater attention than plant-atmosphere coupling (co2 enrichment technology).
dexamethasone represses 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine-stimulated expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in the human cell line ecv 304 the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (icam-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (vcam-1) is increased in immune-mediated diseases. these adhesion molecules promote the adherence of inflammatory cells to parenchymal target cells. we have examined the effect of immunosuppressants on the expression of icam-1 and vcam-1 in a renal tubular epithelial cell line. we found that dexamethasone (4-40 micrograms/ml), the azathioprine metabolite 6-mercaptopurine (10-100 micrograms/ml) and cyclosporine a (0.1-1 microgram/ml) have no effect on the basal and the tumor necrosis factor-alpha- or interleukin-1-stimulated expression of these adhesion molecules. we conclude that these immunosuppressants do not directly influence the expression of icam-1 and vcam-1 by renal tubular epithelium.
primary intracranial melanoma with early leptomeningeal spread: a case report and treatment options available primary central nervous system (cns) melanoma is a type of rare and aggressive tumor that can easily spread to the leptomeninges, and in fact, leptomeningeal metastasis is one of the most serious complications in patients with this carcinoma. prognosis is extremely poor if a cns melanoma has metastasized, and there are no effective treatments. here, we present a case of a 37-year-old woman who presented with horizontal diplopia and progressive headache. magnetic resonance imaging findings were consistent with the diagnosis of melanoma. the results of cytological examination of cerebrospinal fluid (csf) showed malignant cells characteristic of melanoma. no extracranial lesions were observed. all of the available evidence confirmed a diagnosis of leptomeningeal metastases from a primary cns melanoma. the patient received aggressive treatment, which consisted of concurrent radiotherapy and weekly intra-csf methotrexate (mtx) followed by adjuvant monthly intra-csf mtx. her survival time was 13 months after diagnosis. this case report suggests that the modality of concurrent radiotherapy and weekly intra-csf mtx followed by adjuvant monthly intra-csf mtx may be used as the mainstay of treatment for such patients.
heparg microencapsulated spheroids in dmso-free culture: novel culturing approaches for enhanced xenobiotic and biosynthetic metabolism cancer cells in poorly vascularized tumor regions need to adapt to an unfavorable metabolic microenvironment. as distance from supplying blood vessels increases, oxygen and nutrient concentrations decrease and cancer cells react by stopping cell cycle progression and becoming dormant. as cytostatic drugs mainly target proliferating cells, cancer cell dormancy is considered as a major resistance mechanism to this class of anti-cancer drugs. therefore, substances that target cancer cells in poorly vascularized tumor regions have the potential to enhance cytostatic-based chemotherapy of solid tumors. with three-dimensional growth conditions, multicellular tumor spheroids (mcts) reproduce several parameters of the tumor microenvironment, including oxygen and nutrient gradients as well as the development of dormant tumor regions. we here report the setup of a 3d cell culture compatible high-content screening system and the identification of nine substances from two commercially available drug libraries that specifically target cells in inner mcts core regions, while cells in outer mcts regions or in 2d cell culture remain unaffected. we elucidated the mode of action of the identified compounds as inhibitors of the respiratory chain and show that induction of cell death in inner mcts core regions critically depends on extracellular glucose concentrations. finally, combinational treatment with cytostatics showed increased induction of cell death in mcts. the data presented here shows for the first time a high-content based screening setup on 3d tumor spheroids for the identification of substances that specifically induce cell death in inner tumor spheroid core regions. this validates the approach to use 3d cell culture screening systems to identify substances that would not be detectable by 2d based screening in otherwise similar culture conditions.
