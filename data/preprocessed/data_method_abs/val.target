A brief review of scan statistics and their applications to ecological studies and environmental sciences is available by #REF18 The Poisson model is appli- cable in this study of colorectal cancer because the analysis involved small numbers of cases against larger population denominators, as is often the case with cancer.
For this dataset, we applied global contrast normalization and whitening in accordance with the methods outlined in #REF.
In the #REF formulation, we chose only the instance with the maximum score in each positive bag as the ‘‘witness’’; the remaining instances from this bag are not assigned to any class.
Further, we establish that our models have fewer parameters (almost as few as a native network) and so are easier to train than methods like #REF.
