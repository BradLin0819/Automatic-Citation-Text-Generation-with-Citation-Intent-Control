we determined the contribution of the hyperpolarization‐activated cationic (h) current (ih) to the homeostatic regulation of ca1 pyramidal cells in vitro using chronic treatments (48 h) that either increase (picrotoxin) or decrease (kynurenate) neuronal activity. the h‐conductance was found to be up‐ or down‐regulated following chronic activity enhancement or activity deprivation, respectively. this bidirectional plasticity of ih was found to subsequently alter both apparent input resistance and intrinsic neuronal excitability. bidirectional homeostatic plasticity of ih also determined epsp waveform and epsp summation tested at 5–30 hz. long‐term synaptic modification induced by repetitive stimulation of the schaffer collaterals was found to be constant across treatments in the presence of ih but not when ih was blocked pharmacologically. thus, bidirectional homeostatic regulation of ih stabilizes induction of long‐term synaptic modification in ca1 pyramidal neurons that depends on epsp summation. in the cortex, synaptic latencies display small variations ( approximately 1-2 ms) that are generally considered to be negligible. we show here that the synaptic latency at monosynaptically connected pairs of l5 and ca3 pyramidal neurons is determined by the presynaptic release probability (pr): synaptic latency being inversely correlated with the amplitude of the postsynaptic current and sensitive to manipulations of pr. changes in synaptic latency were also observed when pr was physiologically regulated in short- and long-term synaptic plasticity. paired-pulse depression and facilitation were respectively associated with increased and decreased synaptic latencies. similarly, latencies were prolonged following induction of presynaptic ltd and reduced after ltp induction. we show using the dynamic-clamp technique that the observed covariation in latency and synaptic strength is a synergistic combination that significantly affects postsynaptic spiking. in conclusion, amplitude-related variation in latency represents a putative code for short- and long-term synaptic dynamics in cortical networks.
background aims bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd), a chronic lung disease characterized by disrupted lung growth, is the most common complication in extreme premature infants. bpd leads to persistent pulmonary disease later in life. alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (aec2s), a subset of which represent distal lung progenitor cells (lpcs), promote normal lung growth and repair. aec2 depletion may contribute to persistent lung injury in bpd. we hypothesized that induced pluripotent stem cell (ipsc)-derived aecs prevent lung damage in experimental oxygen-induced bpd.   methods mouse aecs (maecs), mipscs/mouse embryonic stem sells, human umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells (hucmscs), human (h)ipscs, hipsc-derived lpcs and hipsc-derived aecs were delivered intratracheally to hyperoxia-exposed newborn mice. cells were pre-labeled with a red fluorescent dye for in vivo tracking.   results airway delivery of primary maecs and undifferentiated murine pluripotent cells prevented hyperoxia-induced impairment in lung function and alveolar growth in neonatal mice. similar to hucmsc therapy, undifferentiated hipscs also preserved lung function and alveolar growth in hyperoxia-exposed neonatal nod/scid mice. long-term assessment of hipsc administration revealed local teratoma formation and cellular infiltration in various organs. to develop a clinically relevant cell therapy, we used a highly efficient method to differentiate hipscs into a homogenous population of aec2s. airway delivery of hipsc-derived aec2s and hipsc-derived lpcs, improved lung function and structure and resulted in long-term engraftment without evidence of tumor formation.   conclusions hipsc-derived aec2 therapy appears effective and safe in this model and warrants further exploration as a therapeutic option for bpd and other lung diseases characterized by aec injury. the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (ipscs) provides the opportunity to use patient‐specific somatic cells, which are a valuable source for disease modeling and drug discovery. to promote research involving these cells, it is important to make ipscs from easily accessible and less invasive tissues, like blood. we have recently reported the efficient generation of human ipscs from adult fibroblasts using a combination of plasmids encoding oct3/4, sox2, klf4, l‐myc, lin28, and shrna for tp53. we herein report a modified protocol enabling efficient ipsc induction from cd34+ cord blood cells and from peripheral blood isolated from healthy donors using these plasmid vectors. the original plasmid mixture could induce ipscs; however, the efficiency was low. the addition of ebna1, an essential factor for episomal amplification of the vectors, by an extra plasmid greatly increased the efficiency of ipsc induction, especially when the induction was performed from αβt cells. this improvement enabled the establishment of blood‐derived ipscs from seven healthy donors ranging in age from their 20s to their 60s. this induction method will be useful for the derivation of patient‐specific integration‐free ipscs and would also be applicable to the generation of clinical‐grade ipscs in the future. stem cells2013;31:458–466
objective to compare the effectiveness of different types of splenectomy in children with congenital hemolytic anemias.   study design we constructed key questions that addressed outcomes relevant to clinicians and families on effects of partial or total splenectomy, including hematologic effect, splenic function, and the risk of adverse events. we identified from pubmed and embase 703 studies that evaluated different types of splenectomy and accepted 93 studies that satisfied entry criteria. we graded the quality of each report and summarized the overall strength of research evidence for each key question.   results we did not identify any randomized clinical trials. all types of splenectomy have favorable clinical outcomes in most diseases. we did not identify any hematologic advantage of laparoscopy compared with laparotomy. adverse events are uncommon in most studies and are minimized with use of laparoscopy.   conclusions there is a need for randomized clinical trials and improved data collection of different types of splenectomy in congenital hemolytic anemias. outcomes studied should address the concerns of families and clinicians to assess the risks and benefits of various treatments. background open partial splenectomy provides reversal of anemia and relief of symptomatic splenomegaly while theoretically retaining splenic immune function for hereditary spherocytosis. we recently developed a laparoscopic approach for partial splenectomy. the purpose of the present study is to compare the outcomes in a group of patients undergoing laparoscopic partial splenectomy (lps) with those in a group of children undergoing laparoscopic total splenectomy (lts) over the same period.   methods systematic chart review was conducted of all children with hereditary spherocytosis who had lts or lps from 2000 to 2006 at the hospital for sick children, toronto, ontario, canada. t tests were used for continuous data, and chi(2) for proportional data; p value of less than .05 was considered significant.   results there were 9 patients (14 males) in each group. groups were similar in sex, age, concomitant cholecystectomy, and preoperative hospitalizations, transfusions, and spleen size. estimated blood loss was greater in the lps group (188 + 53 vs 67 + 17 ml; p = .02), but transfusion requirements were similar (1/9 vs 0/9). complication rate was similar between groups. the lps group had higher morphine use (4.1 + 0.6 vs 2.4 + 0.2 days; p = .03), greater time to oral intake (4.4 + 0.7 vs 2.0 + 0.2 days; p = .01), and longer hospital stay (6.3 + 1.0 vs 2.7 + 0.3 days; p = .005) than the lts group. nuclear scan 6 to 8 weeks postoperatively demonstrated residual perfused splenic tissue in all lps patients. no completion splenectomy was necessary after a mean follow-up of 25 months.   conclusion these data suggest that lps is as effective as lts for control of symptoms. however, lps is associated with more pain, longer time to oral intake, and longer hospital stay. these disadvantages may be balanced by retained splenic immune function, but further studies are required to assess long-term splenic function in these patients.
abstractcoronary artery disease (cad) is the leading cause of death around the world. one of the most common imaging methods for diagnosing cad is the x-ray angiography (xra). diagnosing using xra images is usually challenging due to some reasons such as, non-uniform illumination, low contrast, presence of other body tissues, and presence of catheter. these challenges make the diagnosis task hard and more prone to misdiagnosis. in this paper, we propose a new method for coronary artery segmentation, catheter detection, and centerline extraction in x-ray angiography images. for the segmentation, initially, three different superpixel scales are exploited, and a measure for vesselness probability of each superpixel is determined. a voting mechanism is used for obtaining an initial segmentation map from the three superpixel scales. the initial segmentation is refined by finding the orthogonal line on each ridge pixel of vessel region. the catheter is detected in the first frame of the angiography sequence and is tracked in other frames by fitting a second order polynomial on it. also, we use the image ridges for extracting the coronary artery centerlines. we evaluated and compared our method with one of the previous well-known coronary artery segmentation methods on two challenging datasets. the results show that our method can segment the vessels and also detect and track the catheter in the xra sequences. in general, the results assessed by a cardiologist show that 83% of the images processed by our proposed segmentation method were labeled as good or excellent, while this score for the compared method is 48%. also, the evaluation results show that our method performs 67% faster than the compared method.  graphical abstractproposed framework for coronary artery detection segmentation of coronary arteries in x-ray angiography is a fundamental tool to evaluate arterial diseases and choose proper coronary treatment. the accurate segmentation of coronary arteries has become an important topic for the registration of different modalities, which allows physicians rapid access to different medical imaging information from computed tomography (ct) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (mri). in this paper, we propose an accurate fully automatic algorithm based on graph-cuts for vessel centerline extraction, caliber estimation, and catheter detection. vesselness, geodesic paths, and a new multiscale edgeness map are combined to customize the graph-cuts approach to the segmentation of tubular structures, by means of a global optimization of the graph-cuts energy function. moreover, a novel supervised learning methodology that integrates local and contextual information is proposed for automatic catheter detection. we evaluate the method performance on three datasets coming from different imaging systems. the method performs as good as the expert observer with respect to centerline detection and caliber estimation. moreover, the method discriminates between arteries and catheter with an accuracy of 96.5%, sensitivity of 72%, and precision of 97.4%.
one of the key problems in distributed video coding is the generation of side information. this task consists of producing an estimate of an image with some neighboring ones, such as those taken by the same camera at different time instants, or, in the case of multiview setups, images taken at the same time instant by different cameras. if both estimates are available, a further problem arises, which is how to merge them in order to create a single side information. this problem is very relevant since a good estimate of the unknown image will require only a few bits to be corrected. considering a multiview distributed video-coding setup, we propose a novel technique for inter-view interpolation based on occlusion prediction, a new fusion technique from multiple estimates, and finally an adaptive validation step for switching among the three possible side information images: temporal, inter-view, and fusion. we provide a comprehensive set of experimental results, which indicate bit rate reductions of more than 9% in average; moreover, we observe much more consistent results with respect to state-of-the-art techniques. this paper introduces a hybrid forward-error correction/automatic repeat-request (arq) system that employs rate compatible punctured turbo (rcpt) codes to achieve enhanced throughput performance over a nonstationary gaussian channel. the proposed rcpt-arq system combines the performance of turbo codes with the frugal use of incremental redundancy inherent in the rate compatible punctured convolutional codes of hagenauer (1988). moreover, this paper introduces the notion of puncturing the systematic code symbols of a turbo code to maximize throughput at signal-to-noise ratios (snrs) of interest. the resulting system provides both an efficient family of achievable code rates at middle to high snr and powerful low-rate error correction capability at low snr.
exon skipping uses chemically modified antisense oligonucleotides to modulate rna splicing. therapeutically, exon skipping can bypass mutations and restore reading frame disruption by generating internally truncated, functional proteins to rescue the loss of native gene expression. limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2c is caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the sgcg gene, which encodes the dystrophin-associated protein γ-sarcoglycan. the most common sgcg mutations disrupt the transcript reading frame abrogating γ-sarcoglycan protein expression. in order to treat most sgcg gene mutations, it is necessary to skip 4 exons in order to restore the sgcg transcript reading frame, creating an internally truncated protein referred to as mini-gamma. using direct reprogramming of human cells with myod, myogenic cells were tested with 2 antisense oligonucleotide chemistries, 2'-o-methyl phosphorothioate oligonucleotides and vivo-phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers, to induce exon skipping. treatment with vivo-phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers demonstrated efficient skipping of the targeted exons and corrected the mutant reading frame, resulting in the expression of a functional mini-gamma protein. antisense-induced exon skipping of sgcg occurred in normal cells and those with multiple distinct sgcg mutations, including the most common 521δt mutation. these findings demonstrate a multiexon-skipping strategy applicable to the majority of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2c patients. backgroundcellular models of muscle disease are taking on increasing importance with the large number of genes and mutations implicated in causing myopathies and the concomitant need to test personalized therapies. developing cell models relies on having an easily obtained source of cells, and if the cells are not derived from muscle itself, a robust reprogramming process is needed. fibroblasts are a human cell source that works well for the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells, which can then be differentiated into cardiomyocyte lineages, and with less efficiency, skeletal muscle-like lineages. alternatively, direct reprogramming with the transcription factor myod has been used to generate myotubes from cultured human fibroblasts. although useful, fibroblasts require a skin biopsy to obtain and this can limit their access, especially from pediatric populations.resultswe now demonstrate that direct reprogramming of urine-derived cells is a highly efficient and reproducible process that can be used to establish human myogenic cells. we show that this method can be applied to urine cells derived from normal individuals as well as those with muscle diseases. furthermore, we show that urine-derived cells can be edited using crispr/cas9 technology.conclusionswith progress in understanding the molecular etiology of human muscle diseases, having a readily available, noninvasive source of cells from which to generate muscle-like cells is highly useful.
objectives: this study describes key population health concepts and examines major empirical trends in us health and healthcare inequalities from 1935 to 2016 according to important social determinants such as race/ethnicity, education, income, poverty, area deprivation, unemployment, housing, rural-urban residence, and geographic location. methods: long-term trend data from the national vital statistics system, national health interview survey, national survey of children’s health, american community survey, and behavioral risk factor surveillance system were used to examine racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, rural-urban, and geographic inequalities in health and health care. life tables, age-adjusted rates, prevalence, and risk ratios were used to examine health differentials, which were tested for statistical significance at the 0.05 level. results: life expectancy of americans increased from 69.7 years in 1950 to 78.8 years in 2015. however, despite the overall improvement, substantial gender and racial/ethnic disparities remained. in 2015, life expectancy was highest for asian/pacific islanders (87.7 years) and lowest for african-americans (75.7 years). life expectancy was lower in rural areas and varied from 74.5 years for men in rural areas to 82.4 years for women in large metro areas, with rural-urban disparities increasing during the 1990-2014 time period. infant mortality rates declined dramatically during the past eight decades. however, racial disparities widened over time; in 2015, black infants had 2.3 times higher mortality than white infants (11.4 vs. 4.9 per 1,000 live births). infant and child mortality was markedly higher in rural areas and poor communities. black infants and children in poor, rural communities had nearly three times higher mortality rate compared to those in affluent, rural areas. racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic disparities were particularly marked in mortality and/or morbidity from cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, copd, hiv/aids, homicide, psychological distress, hypertension, smoking, obesity, and access to quality health care. conclusions and global health implications: despite the overall health improvement, significant social disparities remain in a number of health indicators, most notably in life expectancy and infant mortality. marked disparities in various health outcomes indicate the underlying significance of social determinants in disease prevention and health promotion and necessitate systematic and continued monitoring of health inequalities according to social factors. a multi-sectoral approach is needed to tackle persistent and widening health inequalities among americans. background there is limited research on rural-urban disparities in u.s. life expectancy.   purpose this study examined trends in rural-urban disparities in life expectancy at birth in the u.s. between 1969 and 2009.   methods the 1969-2009 u.s. county-level mortality data linked to a rural-urban continuum measure were analyzed. life expectancies were calculated by age, gender, and race for 3-year time periods between 1969 and 2004 and for 2005-2009 using standard life-table methodology. differences in life expectancy were decomposed by age and cause of death.   results life expectancy was inversely related to levels of rurality. in 2005-2009, those in large metropolitan areas had a life expectancy of 79.1 years, compared with 76.9 years in small urban towns and 76.7 years in rural areas. when stratified by gender, race, and income, life expectancy ranged from 67.7 years among poor black men in nonmetropolitan areas to 89.6 among poor asian/pacific islander women in metropolitan areas. rural-urban disparities widened over time. in 1969-1971, life expectancy was 0.4 years longer in metropolitan than in nonmetropolitan areas (70.9 vs 70.5 years). by 2005-2009, the life expectancy difference had increased to 2.0 years (78.8 vs 76.8 years). the rural poor and rural blacks currently experience survival probabilities that urban rich and urban whites enjoyed 4 decades earlier. causes of death contributing most to the increasing rural-urban disparity and lower life expectancy in rural areas include heart disease, unintentional injuries, copd, lung cancer, stroke, suicide, and diabetes.   conclusions between 1969 and 2009, residents in metropolitan areas experienced larger gains in life expectancy than those in nonmetropolitan areas, contributing to the widening gap.
cardiovascular effects of tramadol were evaluated in dogs anesthetized with sevoflurane. six beagle dogs were anesthetized twice at 7 days interval. the minimum alveolar concentration (mac) of sevoflurane was earlier determined in each dog. the dogs were then anesthetized with sevoflurane at 1.3 times of predetermined individual mac and cardiovascular parameters were evaluated before (baseline) and after an intravenous injection of tramadol (4 mg/kg). the administration of tramadol produced a transient and mild increase in arterial blood pressure (abp) (p=0.004) with prolonged increase in systemic vascular resistance (svr) (p<0.0001). compared with baseline value, mean abp increased significantly at 5 min (119% of baseline value, p=0.003), 10 min (113%, p=0.027), and 15 min (111%, p=0.022). svr also increased significantly at 5 min (128%, p<0.0001), 10 min (121%, p=0.026), 30 min (114%, p=0.025), 45 min (113%, p=0.025) and 60 min (112%, p=0.048). plasma concentrations of tramadol were weakly correlated with the percentage changes in mean abp (r=0.642, p<0.0001) and svr (r=0.646, p<0.0001). there was no significant change in heart rate, cardiac output, cardiac index, stroke volume, pulmonary arterial pressure, right atrial pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. in conclusion, the administration of tramadol produces a prolonged peripheral vascular constriction in dogs anesthetized with sevoflurane, which is accompanied with a transient and mild increase in arterial blood pressure. it also indicated that the degree of vasoconstriction might depend on the plasma concentration of tramadol. objective to compare morphine with tramadol for the management of early postoperative pain following ovariohysterectomy after pyometra in dogs.   study design prospective randomized blinded clinical trial.   animals thirty female dogs, 2-14 years old.   methods animals were randomly divided into two equal groups. group 1 received 0.2 mg kg-1 of morphine iv and group 2 received 2 mg kg-1 of tramadol iv after the induction of anesthesia. the dogs were premedicated with acepromazine, and anesthesia was induced with intravenous midazolam and ketamine. isoflurane was used for the maintenance of anesthesia. the variables measured were: analgesia; sedation; cardiac and respiratory rates; arterial blood pressure; end-tidal isoflurane and carbon dioxide (pe'co2); oxyhemoglobin saturation (spo2); plasma catecholamines; serum cortisol and glucose concentrations; ph and blood gases. the animals were monitored for 6 hours after the administration of the analgesic agent.   results there were no differences between the two groups with regard to analgesia, sedation, spo2, ph and blood gases, cardiovascular variables, glucose, catecholamine and cortisol concentrations. forty minutes postopioid administration, the end-tidal isoflurane concentration was significantly lower in the morphine-treated group as compared to the tramadol group. at 30 minutes following opioid injection, pe'co2 was significantly higher in the morphine group than in the tramadol group. two dogs in the tramadol group and one in the morphine group were given morphine postoperatively because of increasing pain scores.   conclusion and clinical relevance morphine and tramadol, administered preemptively can be used safely in dogs to control early pain after ovariohysterectomy without significant adverse effects.
background and purposewe studied the hypothesized effects of changes in self-rated health (srh) on subsequently assessed changes in the levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdl-c), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides (tri), separately for men and women. we also investigated the reverse causation hypothesis, expecting the initial changes in the levels of serum lipids to predict subsequently assessed changes in srh levels.methodswe used a longitudinal design and controlled for possible confounders known to be precursors of both srh and the above three serum lipids. participants were apparently healthy men (n = 846) and women (n = 378) who underwent a routine health check at three points of time (t1, t2, and t3); t1 and t3 were on the average 40 and 44 months apart for the men and women, respectively.results and conclusionsfor the men, relative to t1 srh, an increase in t2 srh was associated with an increase in the t3 hdl-c levels relative to t2 hdl-c and with a decrease in the t3 tri levels relative to t2 tri. for the women, initial changes in the srh levels did not predict follow-up changes in either of the lipids. for both genders, the reverse causation hypothesis, expecting the t1–t2 change in each of the serum lipids to predict t2–t3 change in srh, was not supported. for the men, there is support for the hypothesis that the effects of srh on morbidity and mortality, found by past meta-analytic studies, could be mediated by serum lipids. background the purpose of this study is to test whether the predictive power of an individual's self-rated health (srh) on subsequent mortality risk differs by socioeconomic status (ses) in the united states.   methods we use the national health interview survey 1986-94 linked to multiple cause of death files 1986-97 (nhis-mcd). analyses are based on non-hispanic black and white adults 25 and older (n = 358,388). cox proportional hazard models are used to estimate the effect of srh on mortality risk during follow-up. interactions of srh and level of education and srh and level of income are used to assess differences in the predictive power of srh for subsequent mortality risk.   results the effect of srh on subsequent mortality risk differs by level of education and level of income. lower health ratings are more strongly associated with mortality for adults with higher education and/or higher income relative to their lower ses counterparts.   conclusions our findings suggest that individuals with different education or income levels may evaluate their health differently with respect to the traditional five-point srh scale, and hence their subjective health ratings may not be directly comparable. these results have important implications for research that tries to quantify and explain socioeconomic inequalities in health based on self-rated health.
we consider the problem of using a heuristic policy to improve the value approximation by the upper confidence bound applied in trees (uct) algorithm in non-adversarial settings such as planning with large-state space markov decision processes. current improvements to uct focus on either changing the action selection formula at the internal nodes or the rollout policy at the leaf nodes of the search tree. in this work, we propose to add an auxiliary arm to each of the internal nodes, and always use the heuristic policy to roll out simulations at the auxiliary arms. the method aims to get fast convergence to optimal values at states where the heuristic policy is optimal, while retaining similar approximation as the original uct at other states. we show that bootstrapping with the proposed method in the new algorithm, uct-aux, performs better compared to the original uct algorithm and its variants in two benchmark experiment settings. we also examine conditions under which uct-aux works well. the uct algorithm learns a value function online using sample-based search. the td(λ) algorithm can learn a value function offline for the on-policy distribution. we consider three approaches for combining offline and online value functions in the uct algorithm. first, the offline value function is used as a default policy during monte-carlo simulation. second, the uct value function is combined with a rapid online estimate of action values. third, the offline value function is used as prior knowledge in the uct search tree. we evaluate these algorithms in 9 x 9 go against gnugo 3.7.10. the first algorithm performs better than uct with a random simulation policy, but surprisingly, worse than uct with a weaker, handcrafted simulation policy. the second algorithm outperforms uct altogether. the third algorithm outperforms uct with handcrafted prior knowledge. we combine these algorithms in mogo, the world's strongest 9 x 9 go program. each technique significantly improves mogo's playing strength.
interchangeability is a symmetry property of constraint satisfaction problems that can be used to remove domain values, thus reducing the size of the problem. computing all interchangeable values is thought to be intractable, so previous research has focused on restricted versions such as neighborhood interchangeability. we show that full dynamic interchangeability in binary problems can be statically exploited by adding a linear number of constraints to the model, which also exploit a form of substitutability. using satisfiability encodings of colouring benchmarks, we provide empirical evidence that this technique can improve both forward checking and arc consistent search. we introduce a new method, called symmetry excluding search (ses), for excluding symmetries in constraint based search. to our knowledge, it is the first declarative method that can be applied to arbitrary symmetries. the ses-method is based on the notion of symmetric constraints, which are used in our modification of a general constraint based search algorithm. the method does not influence the search strategy. furthermore, it can be used with either the full set of symmetries, or a subset of all symmetries.we proof correctness, completeness and symmetry exclusion properties of our method. then, we show how to apply the ses-method in the special case of geometric symmetries (rotations and reflections) and permutation symmetries. furthermore, we give results from practical applications.
in many organisms, transcription of the zygotic genome begins during the maternal-to-zygotic transition (mzt), which is characterized by a dramatic increase in global transcriptional activities and coincides with embryonic stem cell differentiation. in drosophila, it has been shown that maternal morphogen gradients and ubiquitously distributed general transcription factors may cooperate to upregulate zygotic genes that are essential for pattern formation in the early embryo. here, we show that drosophila stat (stat92e) functions as a general transcription factor that, together with the transcription factor zelda, induces transcription of a large number of early-transcribed zygotic genes during the mzt. stat92e is present in the early embryo as a maternal product and is active around the mzt. dna–binding motifs for stat and zelda are highly enriched in promoters of early zygotic genes but not in housekeeping genes. loss of stat92e in the early embryo, similarly to loss of zelda, preferentially down-regulates early zygotic genes important for pattern formation. we further show that stat92e and zelda synergistically regulate transcription. we conclude that stat92e, in conjunction with zelda, plays an important role in transcription of the zygotic genome at the onset of embryonic development. stat (signal transducer and activator of transcription) is a potent transcription factor and its aberrant activation by phosphorylation is associated with human cancers. we have shown previously that overactivation of jak, which phosphorylates stat, disrupts heterochromatin formation globally in drosophila melanogaster. however, it remains unclear how this effect is mediated and whether stat is involved. here, we demonstrate that drosophila stat (stat92e) is involved in controlling heterochromatin protein 1 (hp1) distribution and heterochromatin stability. we found, unexpectedly, that loss of stat92e, had the same effects as overactivation of jak in disrupting heterochromatin formation and heterochromatic gene silencing, whereas overexpression of stat92e had the opposite effects. we have further shown that the unphosphorylated or 'transcriptionally inactive' form of stat92e is localized on heterochromatin in association with hp1, and is required for stabilizing hp1 localization and histone h3 lys 9 methylation (h3mk9) . however, activation by phosphorylation reduces heterochromatin-associated stat92e, causing hp1 displacement and heterochromatin destabilization. thus, reducing levels of unphosphorylated stat92e, either by loss of stat92e or increased phosphorylation, causes heterochromatin instability. these results suggest that activation of stat by phosphorylation controls both access to chromatin and activity of the transcription machinery.
microreserves may be useful in protecting native arthropod diversity in urbanized landscapes. however, species that do not disperse through the urban matrix may eventually be lost from these fragments. population extinctions may be precipitated by an increase in genetic differentiation among fragments and loss of genetic diversity within fragments, and these effects should become stronger with time. we analyzed population genetic structure in the dispersal limited jerusalem cricket stenopelmatus n. sp. “santa monica” in the santa monica mountains and simi hills north of los angeles, california (ca), to determine the impacts of fragmentation over the past 70 years. mtdna divergence was greater among urban fragments than within contiguous habitat and was positively correlated with fragment age. mtdna genetic diversity within fragments increased with fragment size and decreased with fragment age. genetic divergence across 38 anonymous nuclear inter-simple sequence repeat (issr) loci was influenced by the presence of major highways and highway age, but there was no effect of additional urban fragmentation. issr diversity was not correlated with fragment size or age. differing results between markers may be due to male-biased dispersal, or different effective population sizes, sorting rates, or mutation rates among sampled genes. results suggest that genetic connectivity among populations has been disrupted by highways and urban development, prior to declines in local population sizes. we emphasize that genetic connectivity can rapidly erode in fragmented landscapes and that flightless arthropods can serve as sensitive indicators for these effects. with the aim of analyzing and interpreting data on dna polymorphism obtained by dna sequencing or restriction enzyme technique, a mathematical theory on the expected evolutionary relationship among dna sequences (nucleons) sampled is developed under the assumption that the evolutionary change of nucleons is determined solely by mutation and random genetic drift. the statistical property of the number of nucleotide differences between randomly chosen nucleons and that of heterozygosity or nucleon diversity is investigated using this theory. these studies indicate that the estimates of the average number of nucleotide differences and nucleon diversity have a large variance, and a large part of this variance is due to stochastic factors. therefore, increasing sample size does not help reduce the variance significantly the distribution of sample allele (nucleomorph) frequencies is also studied, and it is shown that a small number of samples are sufficient in order to know the distribution pattern.
this paper introduces adaptive computation time (act), an algorithm that allows recurrent neural networks to learn how many computational steps to take between receiving an input and emitting an output. act requires minimal changes to the network architecture, is deterministic and differentiable, and does not add any noise to the parameter gradients. experimental results are provided for four synthetic problems: determining the parity of binary vectors, applying binary logic operations, adding integers, and sorting real numbers. overall, performance is dramatically improved by the use of act, which successfully adapts the number of computational steps to the requirements of the problem. we also present character-level language modelling results on the hutter prize wikipedia dataset. in this case act does not yield large gains in performance; however it does provide intriguing insight into the structure of the data, with more computation allocated to harder-to-predict transitions, such as spaces between words and ends of sentences. this suggests that act or other adaptive computation methods could provide a generic method for inferring segment boundaries in sequence data. we introduce adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. the method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. the method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. the hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. some connections to related algorithms, on which adam was inspired, are discussed. we also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. empirical results demonstrate that adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. finally, we discuss adamax, a variant of adam based on the infinity norm.
purpose to report the identification of a novel frameshift mutation and copy number variation (cnv) in pikfyve in two probands with fleck corneal dystrophy (fcd). methods slit-lamp examination was performed to identify characteristic features of fcd. after genomic dna was collected, pcr amplification and automated sequencing of all 41 exons of pikfyve was performed. using genomic dna, quantitative pcr (qpcr) was performed to detect cnvs within pikfyve. results in the first fcd proband, numerous panstromal punctate opacities were observed in each of the proband’s corneas, consistent with the diagnosis of fcd. screening of pikfyve demonstrated a novel heterozygous frameshift mutation in exon 19, c.3151dupa, which is predicted to encode for a truncated pikfyve protein, p.(asp1052argfs*18). this variant was identified in an affected sister but not in the proband’s unaffected mother or brother or 200 control chromosomes. the second fcd proband presented with bilateral, discrete, punctate, grayish-white stromal opacities. exonic screening of pikfyve revealed no causative variant. however, cnv analysis demonstrated the hemizygous deletion of exons 15 and 16. conclusions we report a novel heterozygous frameshift mutation (c.3151dupa) and a cnv in pikfyve, representing the first cnv and the fifth frameshift mutation associated with fcd. genetic polymorphisms are often considered as risk factors of complex diseases serving as valuable and easily detectable biomarkers, also stable during the whole lifespan. a novel type of genetic polymorphism has been identified just recently, referred to as gene copy number variation (cnv) or copy number polymorphism. cnv of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta and its adjacent gene, nr1i2 (pregnane x receptor isoform), has been reported to associate with bipolar depression. in our study we introduced multicapillary electrophoresis for gene copy number analysis as an affordable alternative to real‐time pcr quantification with taqman gene probes. our results show the reliability of the developed method based on conventional pcr followed by separation of products by multicapillary electrophoresis with quantitative evaluation. this method can be readily implemented for the analysis of candidate gene cnvs in high throughput clinical laboratories and also in personalized medicine care of depression‐related risk factors.
background chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing is a genome-wide analysis technique that can be used to detect various epigenetic phenomena such as, transcription factor binding sites and histone modifications. histone modification profiles can be either punctate or diffuse which makes it difficult to distinguish regions of enrichment from background noise. with the discovery of histone marks having a wide variety of enrichment patterns, there is an urgent need for analysis methods that are robust to various data characteristics and capable of detecting a broad range of enrichment patterns. results to address these challenges we propose waveseq, a novel data-driven method of detecting regions of significant enrichment in chip-seq data. our approach utilizes the wavelet transform, is free of distributional assumptions and is robust to diverse data characteristics such as low signal-to-noise ratios and broad enrichment patterns. using publicly available datasets we showed that waveseq compares favorably with other published methods, exhibiting high sensitivity and precision for both punctate and diffuse enrichment regions even in the absence of a control data set. the application of our algorithm to a complex histone modification data set helped make novel functional discoveries which further underlined its utility in such an experimental setup. conclusions waveseq is a highly sensitive method capable of accurate identification of enriched regions in a broad range of data sets. waveseq can detect both narrow and broad peaks with a high degree of accuracy even in low signal-to-noise ratio data sets. waveseq is also suited for application in complex experimental scenarios, helping make biologically relevant functional discoveries. a practical step-by-step guide to wavelet analysis is given, with examples taken from time series of the el nino–southern oscillation (enso). the guide includes a comparison to the windowed fourier transform, the choice of an appropriate wavelet basis function, edge effects due to finite-length time series, and the relationship between wavelet scale and fourier frequency. new statistical significance tests for wavelet power spectra are developed by deriving theoretical wavelet spectra for white and red noise processes and using these to establish significance levels and confidence intervals. it is shown that smoothing in time or scale can be used to increase the confidence of the wavelet spectrum. empirical formulas are given for the effect of smoothing on significance levels and confidence intervals. extensions to wavelet analysis such as filtering, the power hovmoller, cross-wavelet spectra, and coherence are described. the statistical significance tests are used to give a quantitative measure of change...
in this paper, we propose a biased subspace learning approach for misalignment-robust facial expression recognition. while a variety of facial expression recognition methods have been proposed in the literature, most of them only work well when face images are well registered and aligned. in many practical applications such as human robot interaction and visual surveillance, it is still challenging to obtain well-aligned face images for facial expression recognition due to currently imperfect computer vision techniques, especially under uncontrolled conditions. motivated by the fact that interclass facial images with small differences are more easily mis-classified than those with large differences, we propose a biased linear discriminant analysis (blda) method by imposing large penalties on interclass samples with small differences and small penalties on those samples with large differences simultaneously, so that discriminative features can be better extracted for recognition. moreover, we generate more virtually misaligned facial expression samples and assign different weights to them according to their occurrence probabilities in the testing phase to learn a weighted blda (wblda) feature space to extract misalignment-robust discriminative features for recognition. to better exploit the geometrical information of face samples, we propose a weighted biased margin fisher analysis (wbmfa) method by employing a graph embedding criterion to extract discriminative information, so that the assumption of the gaussian distribution of samples is not necessary. experimental results on two widely used face databases are presented to show the efficacy of the proposed methods. we propose an appearance-based face recognition method called the laplacianface approach. by using locality preserving projections (lpp), the face images are mapped into a face subspace for analysis. different from principal component analysis (pca) and linear discriminant analysis (lda) which effectively see only the euclidean structure of face space, lpp finds an embedding that preserves local information, and obtains a face subspace that best detects the essential face manifold structure. the laplacianfaces are the optimal linear approximations to the eigenfunctions of the laplace beltrami operator on the face manifold. in this way, the unwanted variations resulting from changes in lighting, facial expression, and pose may be eliminated or reduced. theoretical analysis shows that pca, lda, and lpp can be obtained from different graph models. we compare the proposed laplacianface approach with eigenface and fisherface methods on three different face data sets. experimental results suggest that the proposed laplacianface approach provides a better representation and achieves lower error rates in face recognition.
relationships between hydrology, ecosystem function and livelihood outcomes in nyando papyrus wetland in western kenya were integrated in a bayesian network model with 34 nodes which was populated with results of ecohydrological and socio-economic research and stakeholder consultations. scenarios for dry and wet seasons were evaluated. for a current “average” year in nyando wetland the probabilities of “ecosystem function” and “livelihoods outcomes” being “good” were 62 and 19 %, respectively. under dry conditions, these values changed to 33 and 37 %; and under wet conditions to 85 and 6 %, respectively, indicating that wet conditions had a positive effect on the ecosystem but a negative effect on livelihoods. ecosystem function and livelihood outcomes were most sensitive to flooding, conversion to agriculture, livestock grazing, and papyrus harvest. flooded conditions limit cropping, livestock herding and vegetation harvesting but have a positive effect on ecosystem function. the advantage of this interdisciplinary and participatory modeling approach is that it allows incorporation of formal and informal knowledge, allows evaluation of policy scenarios and trade-offs between ecosystem services, and recognizes uncertainty in system outcomes. further work will incorporate the impact of management policies and institutions on resource use. this approach will be useful in decision support for wise use of wetlands. a bayesian belief network (bn) for farming contracts has been constructed and validated with direct co-operation and in dialogue with stakeholders. on the one hand, bn’s can create space for an open dialogue with stakeholders due to the flexibility of the decision support tool. this allows factors (nodes), associations (directed links) and probabilities to be adjusted and validated throughout the process and based on inputs from all involved stakeholders and experts. on the other hand getting stakeholders to understand and accept the idea behind bns is demanding. especially the required probability assessments are not easy to understand by stakeholders. copyright © 2004 ifac
we present a simple and effective method for 3d hand pose estimation from a single depth frame. as opposed to previous state-of-the-art methods based on holistic 3d regression, our method works on dense pixel-wise estimation. this is achieved by careful design choices in pose parameterization, which leverages both 2d and 3d properties of depth map. specifically, we decompose the pose parameters into a set of per-pixel estimations, i.e., 2d heat maps, 3d heat maps and unit 3d directional vector fields. the 2d/3d joint heat maps and 3d joint offsets are estimated via multitask network cascades, which is trained end-to-end. the pixel-wise estimations can be directly translated into a vote casting scheme. a variant of mean shift is then used to aggregate local votes while enforcing consensus between the the estimated 3d pose and the pixel-wise 2d and 3d estimations by design. our method is efficient and highly accurate. on msra and nyu hand dataset, our method outperforms all previous state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin. on the icvl hand dataset, our method achieves similar accuracy compared to the nearly saturated result obtained by [5] and outperforms various other proposed methods. code is available online1. we present a novel method for real-time continuous pose recovery of markerless complex articulable objects from a single depth image. our method consists of the following stages: a randomized decision forest classifier for image segmentation, a robust method for labeled dataset generation, a convolutional network for dense feature extraction, and finally an inverse kinematics stage for stable real-time pose recovery. as one possible application of this pipeline, we show state-of-the-art results for real-time puppeteering of a skinned hand-model.
dengue virus (denv) causes the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral disease of humans worldwide. glycosphingolipids (gsls) are involved in virus infection by regulating various steps of viral-host interaction. however, the distinct role of gsls during denv infection remains unclear. in this study, we used mouse melanoma b16 cells and their gsl-deficient mutant counterpart gm95 cells to study the influence of gsls on denv infection. surprisingly, gm95 cells were highly resistant to denv infection compared with b16 cells. pretreatment of b16 cells with synthetase inhibitor of gm3, the most abundant gsls in b16 cells, or silencing gm3 synthetase t3gal5, significantly inhibited denv infection. denv attachment and endocytosis were not impaired in gm95 cells, but denv genome replication was obviously inhibited in gm95 cells compared to b16 cells. furthermore, gm3 was colocalized with denv viral replication complex on endoplasmic reticulum (er) inside the b16 cells. finally, gm3 synthetase inhibitor significantly reduced the mortality rate of suckling mice that challenged with denv by impairing the viral replication in mouse brain. taken together, these data indicated that gm3 was not required for denv attachment and endocytosis, however, essential for viral genome replication. targeting gm3 could be a novel strategy to inhibit denv infection. replicon systems have been used for high-throughput screening of anti-dengue virus (anti-denv) inhibitors and for understanding mechanisms of viral replication. in the present study, we constructed novel denv-1 replicons encoding gaussia luciferase that was secreted into the culture medium. two types of constructs were generated: rna-based and dna-based. each type was translated in an internal ribosome entry site (ires)-dependent or ires-independent manner. among these constructs, the dna-based replicon employing ires-dependent translation (dgl2) produced the highest titer. luciferase levels in the culture medium revealed that the dgl2 replicon was inhibited by ribavirin (a well-known denv inhibitor) at levels similar to those measured for drug inhibition of multi-round denv-1 infection. these results indicate that the dna-based ires-driven denv-1 replicon may facilitate studies on viral replication and antiviral compound discovery.
the medicago truncatula transcription factor nin coordinates diverse processes during nodulation, restricting enod11 expression in the root epidermis and promoting cre1 expression in the root cortex. biological nitrogen fixation in legumes occurs in nodules that are initiated in the root cortex following nod factor recognition at the root surface, and this requires coordination of diverse developmental programs in these different tissues. we show that while early nod factor signaling associated with calcium oscillations is limited to the root surface, the resultant activation of nodule inception (nin) in the root epidermis is sufficient to promote cytokinin signaling and nodule organogenesis in the inner root cortex. nin or a product of its action must be associated with the transmission of a signal between the root surface and the cortical cells where nodule organogenesis is initiated. nin appears to have distinct functions in the root epidermis and the root cortex. in the epidermis, nin restricts the extent of early nodulin 11 (enod11) expression and does so through competitive inhibition of erf required for nodulation (ern1). in contrast, nin is sufficient to promote the expression of the cytokinin receptor cytokinin response 1 (cre1), which is restricted to the root cortex. our work in medicago truncatula highlights the complexity of nin action and places nin as a central player in the coordination of the symbiotic developmental programs occurring in differing tissues of the root that combined are necessary for a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis. lipochitooligosaccharide nodulation factors (nfs) secreted by endosymbiotic nitrogen-fixing rhizobia trigger ca2+ spiking in the cytoplasmic perinuclear region of host legume root hairs. to determine whether nfs also elicit ca2+ responses within the plant cell nucleus we have made use of a nucleoplasmin-tagged cameleon (nupyc2.1). confocal microscopy using this nuclear-specific calcium reporter has revealed sustained and regular ca2+ spiking within the nuclear compartment of medicago truncatula root hairs treated with sinorhizobium meliloti nfs. since the activation of ca2+ oscillations is blocked in m. truncatula nfp, dmi1, and dmi2 mutants, and unaltered in a dmi3 background, it is likely that intranuclear spiking lies on the established nf-dependent signal transduction pathway, leading to cytoplasmic calcium spiking. a semiautomated mathematical procedure has been developed to identify and analyze nuclear ca2+ spiking profiles, and has revealed high cell-to-cell variability in terms of both periodicity and spike duration. time-lapse imaging of the cameleon förster resonance energy transfer-based ratio has allowed us to visualize the nuclear spiking variability in situ and to demonstrate the absence of spiking synchrony between adjacent growing root hairs. finally, spatio-temporal analysis of the asymmetric nuclear spike suggests that the initial rapid increase in ca2+ concentration occurs principally in the vicinity of the nuclear envelope. the discovery that rhizobial nf perception leads to the activation of cell-autonomous ca2+ oscillations on both sides of the nuclear envelope raises major questions about the respective roles of the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments in transducing this key endosymbiotic signal.
1this paper formulates the problem of agent negotiation in service discovery phase. we have elaborated the description model of semantic web service and agent service knowledge model. on the basis of two models, a formal approach to describing the negotiation process of service property values is proposed,and a service discovery case is designed using the agent negotiation method. the experimental results show that the designed knowledge model and the semantic negotiation protocol in service discovery can improve the understanding capability of service agents significantly. with the increase in the quantity of the deployed services and the negotiated properties, the time of returning the discovered results is prolonged slightly, but the accuracy of service discovery is advanced greatly. the agent metaphor has shown its usefulness for modelling as well as implementing complex and dynamic applications. although a number of agent applications has been successfully realised and used, it must be stated that the distribution of commercial off-the-shelf applications is very scarce. for this discontenting situation, at least two reasons can be identified. on the one hand, the development of agent-based applications is difficult suffering from insufficient standards and tools and on the other hand deployment issues are little researched and supported. in this paper, several deployment-related topics are discussed and a vision for the deployment of distributed multi-agent systems is conceived. from the vision, requirements for launching and configuring agent applications are derived. according to these requirements, a platform independent reference model of the proposed deployment infrastructure is presented. the reference model provides the basis for the development of our ascml (agent society configuration manager and launcher) tool, which is currently implemented for the jade and jadex multi-agent platforms.
quality assessment (qa) for predicted protein structural models is an important and challenging research problem in protein structure prediction. consensus global distance test (cgdt) methods assess each decoy (predicted structural model) based on its structural similarity to all others in a decoy set and has been proved to work well when good decoys are in a majority cluster. scoring functions evaluate each single decoy based on its structural properties. both methods have their merits and limitations. in this paper, we present a novel method called pwcom, which consists of two neural networks sequentially to combine cgdt and single model scoring methods such as rw, ddfire and opus-ca. specifically, for every pair of decoys, the difference of the corresponding feature vectors is input to the first neural network which enables one to predict whether the decoy-pair are significantly different in terms of their gdt scores to the native. if yes, the second neural network is used to decide which one of the two is closer to the native structure. the quality score for each decoy in the pool is based on the number of winning times during the pairwise comparisons. test results on three benchmark datasets from different model generation methods showed that pwcom significantly improves over consensus gdt and single scoring methods. the qa server (mufold-server) applying this method in casp 10 qa category was ranked the second place in terms of pearson and spearman correlation performance. for a successful analysis of the relation between amino acid sequence and protein structure, an unambiguous and physically meaningful definition of secondary structure is essential. we have developed a set of simple and physically motivated criteria for secondary structure, programmed as a pattern‐recognition process of hydrogen‐bonded and geometrical features extracted from x‐ray coordinates. cooperative secondary structure is recognized as repeats of the elementary hydrogen‐bonding patterns “turn” and “bridge.” repeating turns are “helices,” repeating bridges are “ladders,” connected ladders are “sheets.” geometric structure is defined in terms of the concepts torsion and curvature of differential geometry. local chain “chirality” is the torsional handedness of four consecutive cα positions and is positive for right‐handed helices and negative for ideal twisted β‐sheets. curved pieces are defined as “bends.” solvent “exposure” is given as the number of water molecules in possible contact with a residue. the end result is a compilation of the primary structure, including ss bonds, secondary structure, and solvent exposure of 62 different globular proteins. the presentation is in linear form: strip graphs for an overall view and strip tables for the details of each of 10.925 residues. the dictionary is also available in computer‐readable form for protein structure prediction work.
existing logo detection methods usually consider a small number of logo classes and limited images per class with a strong assumption of requiring tedious object bounding box annotations, therefore not scalable to real-world applications. in this work, we tackle these challenges by exploring the webly data learning principle without the need for exhaustive manual labelling. specifically, we propose a novel incremental learning approach, called scalable logo self-training (slst), capable of automatically self-discovering informative training images from noisy web data for progressively improving model capability. moreover, we introduce a very large (1,867,177 images of 194 logo classes) logo dataset "weblogo-2m"1 by an automatic web data collection and processing method. extensive comparative evaluations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed slst method over state-of-the-art strongly and weakly supervised detection models and contemporary webly data learning alternatives. state-of-the-art object detection networks depend on region proposal algorithms to hypothesize object locations. advances like sppnet and fast r-cnn have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. in this work, we introduce a region proposal network (rpn) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. an rpn is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. the rpn is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by fast r-cnn for detection. we further merge rpn and fast r-cnn into a single network by sharing their convolutional features---using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the rpn component tells the unified network where to look. for the very deep vgg-16 model, our detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a gpu, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on pascal voc 2007, 2012, and ms coco datasets with only 300 proposals per image. in ilsvrc and coco 2015 competitions, faster r-cnn and rpn are the foundations of the 1st-place winning entries in several tracks. code has been made publicly available
the hiv risk-taking behavior scale (hrbs) is an 11-item instrument designed to assess the risks of hiv infection due to self-reported injection-drug use and sexual behavior. a retrospective analysis was performed on hrbs data collected from approximately 1,000 participants pooled across seven clinical trials of pharmacotherapies for either the treatment of cocaine dependence or methamphetamine dependence. analysis faced three important challenges. the sample contained a high proportion of missing assessments after randomization. also, the hrbs scale consists of two distinct behavioral components which may or may not coincide in response patterns. in addition, distributions of responses on the subscales were highly concentrated at just a few values (e.g., 0, 6). to address these challenges, a single probit regression model was fit to three outcomes variables simultaneously – the two subscale totals plus an indicator variable for assessments not obtained (non-response). this joint-outcome regression model was able to identify that those who left assessment early had higher self-reported risk of injection-drug use and lower self-reported risky sexual behavior because the model was able to draw on information on associations among the three outcomes collectively. these findings were not identified in analyses performed on each outcome separately. no evidence for an effect of pharmacotherapies was observed, except to reduce missing assessments. univariate-outcome modeling is not recommended for the hrbs. multivariate longitudinal data with mixed continuous and discrete responses with the possibility of non-ignorable missingness are often common in follow-up medical studies and their analysis needs to be developed. standard methods of analysis based on the strong and the unverifiable assumption of missing at random (mar) mechanism could be highly misleading. a way out of this problem is to start with methods that simultaneously allow modelling non-ignorable mechanism, which includes somehow troubling computations that are often time consuming, then we can use a sensitivity analysis, in which one estimates models under a range of assumptions about non-ignorability parameters to study the impact of these parameters on key inferences. a general index of sensitivity to non-ignorability (isni) to measure sensitivity of key inferences in a neighborhood of mar model without fitting a complicated not mar (nmar) model for univariate generalized linear models and for models used for univariate longitudinal normal and non-gaussian data with potentially nmar dropout are well presented in the literature. in this paper we extend isni methodology to analyze multivariate longitudinal mixed data subject to non-ignorable dropout in which the non-ignorable dropout model could be dependent on the mixed responses. the approach is illustrated by analyzing a longitudinal data set in which the general substantive goal of the study is to better understand the relations between parental assessment of child's antisocial behavior and child's reading recognition skill.
backgroundbabesiosis is an emerging and potentially zoonotic disease caused by tick-borne piroplasmids of the babesia genus. new genetic variants of piroplasmids with unknown associations to vectors and hosts are recognized. data on the occurrence of babesia spp. in ticks and wildlife widen the knowledge on the geographical distribution and circulation of piroplasmids in natural foci. questing and rodent-attached ticks, rodents, and birds were screened for the presence of babesia-specific dna using molecular methods. spatial and temporal differences of babesia spp. prevalence in ticks and rodents from two contrasting habitats of slovakia with sympatric occurrence of ixodes ricinus and haemaphysalis concinna ticks and co-infections of candidatus n. mikurensis and anaplasma phagocytophilum were investigated.resultsbabesia spp. were detected in 1.5 % and 6.6 % of questing i. ricinus and h. concinna, respectively. prevalence of babesia-infected i. ricinus was higher in a natural than an urban/suburban habitat. phylogenetic analysis showed that babesia spp. from i. ricinus clustered with babesia microti, babesia venatorum, babesia canis, babesia capreoli/babesia divergens, and babesia odocoilei. babesia spp. amplified from h. concinna segregated into two monophyletic clades, designated babesia sp. 1 (eurasia) and babesia sp. 2 (eurasia), each of which represents a yet undescribed novel species. the prevalence of infection in rodents (with apodemus flavicollis and myodes glareolus prevailing) with b. microti was 1.3 % in an urban/suburban and 4.2 % in a natural habitat. the majority of infected rodents (81.3 %) were positive for spleen and blood and the remaining for lungs and/or skin. rodent-attached i. ricinus (accounting for 96.3 %) and h. concinna were infected with b. microti, b. venatorum, b. capreoli/b. divergens, babesia sp. 1 (eurasia), and babesia sp. 2 (eurasia). all b. microti and b. venatorum isolates were identical to known zoonotic strains from europe. less than 1.0 % of babesia-positive ticks and rodents carried candidatus n. mikurensis or a. phagocytophilum.conclusionour findings suggest that i. ricinus and rodents play important roles in the epidemiology of zoonotic babesia spp. in south-western slovakia. associations with vertebrate hosts and the pathogenicity of babesia spp. infecting h. concinna ticks need to be further explored. we describe muscle, a new computer program for creating multiple alignments of protein sequences. elements of the algorithm include fast distance estimation using kmer counting, progressive alignment using a new profile function we call the log-expectation score, and refinement using tree-dependent restricted partitioning. the speed and accuracy of muscle are compared with t-coffee, mafft and clustalw on four test sets of reference alignments: balibase, sabmark, smart and a new benchmark, prefab. muscle achieves the highest, or joint highest, rank in accuracy on each of these sets. without refinement, muscle achieves average accuracy statistically indistinguishable from t-coffee and mafft, and is the fastest of the tested methods for large numbers of sequences, aligning 5000 sequences of average length 350 in 7 min on a current desktop computer. the muscle program, source code and prefab test data are freely available at http://www.drive5. com/muscle.
introduction without affecting the lipid profile, a low-dose treatment with atorvastatin contributes to the reduction of oxidative stress, inflammation, and adverse cardiovascular events in diabetes. in this study, we investigated whether low-dose atorvastatin exerts any beneficial effect on vascular dynamics in streptozotocin (stz)-induced diabetes in male wistar rats. methods diabetes was induced using a single tail-vein injection of stz at 55 mg kg−1. the diabetic rats were treated daily with atorvastatin (10 mg kg−1 by oral gavage) for 6 weeks. they were also compared with untreated age-matched diabetic controls. arterial wave reflection was derived using the impulse response function of the filtered aortic input impedance spectra. a thiobarbituric acid reactive substances measurement was used to estimate the malondialdehyde content. results the high plasma level of total cholesterol in the diabetic rats did not change in response to this low-dose treatment with atorvastatin. atorvastatin resulted in a significant increase of 15.4% in wave transit time and a decrease of 33.5% in wave reflection factor, suggesting that atorvastatin may attenuate the diabetes-induced deterioration in systolic loads imposed on the heart. this was in parallel with its lowering of malondialdehyde content in plasma and aortic walls in diabetes. atorvastatin therapy also prevented the diabetes-related cardiac hypertrophy, as evidenced by the diminished ratio of left ventricular weight to body weight. conclusion these findings indicate that low-dose atorvastatin might protect diabetic vasculature against diabetes-associated deterioration in aorta stiffness and cardiac hypertrophy, possibly through its decrease of lipid oxidation-derived malondialdehyde. human plasma lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (lcat) transacylates the sn-2 fatty acid of lecithin to cholesterol forming cholesteryl ester and lysolecithin. measurement of the phospholipase a2 and transacylase activities of the enzyme using proteoliposome substrates and following selective chemical modification of serine, histidine, and cysteine residues of pure homogeneous lcat indicated the following catalytic mechanism: hs-cys-e-ser-oh + lecithin in equilibrium hs-cys-e-ser-o-fa + lysolecithin, hs-cys-e-ser-o-fa in equilibrium fa-s-cys-e-ser-oh, fa-s-cys-e-ser-oh + cholesterol-oh in equilibrium hs-cys-e-ser-oh + cholesterol-o-fa, where fa denotes fatty acid. modification of 2 lcat cysteine residues with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) or treatment with ferricyanide inactivated the transacylase but not the phospholipase a2 activity. modification of 1 serine residue with phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride or 1 histidine residue with diethyl pyrocarbonate inhibited cholesteryl ester formation and phospholipase a2 activity. proteoliposome substrates protected both activities against chemical inactivation. lecithin alone protected the phospholipase a2 activity against phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride inactivation but not the transacylase against 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) inactivation. incubation of native lcat with arachidonyl-coa or the lecithin-apo-a-i proteoliposome resulted in acylation of three enzyme sites, only one of which was stable to neutral hydroxylamine after denaturation. fatty acylenzyme oxy- and thioesters were demonstrable in both cases. no transfer of arachidonic acid from iodoacetamide-modified lcat to cholesterol occurred, indicating that the fatty-acylated serine residue cannot directly esterify cholesterol. cholesterol arachidonate was formed upon incubation of phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride-modified lcat with arachidonyl-coa.
pollination and fertilization trigger unique developmental programs leading to embryogenesis, ovary maturation and seed set. pistil tissues are actively involved in pollen tube growth and respond to the presence of the growing pollen tubes by modulating the expression of specific genes. using subtractive hybridization to isolate genes involved in pollen-pistil interactions and fertilization, we have isolated a pollination- and fertilization-induced dioxygenase which is predominantly expressed in the pistil. in situ hybridization analyses revealed that the spp2 dioxygenase (solanum pollinated pistil) from the self-incompatible wild potato solanum chacoense bitt. is also developmentally regulated, with mrna levels gradually regressing from the tip of the style towards the ovary during pistil development. at maturity, the upper limit of spp2 transcript distribution coincided with the abscission zone of the style and spp2 dioxygenase expression in ovaries coincided with the fertilization receptivity period of the flower. pollination, as well as wounding of the style, induced an increase in spp2 mrna steady-state levels at a distance, in the ovary. treatments with stress hormones including methyl jasmonate, jasmonic acid and salicylic acid mimicked the wound response and also induced spp2 transcripts in the ovary. the spp2 dioxygenase could be involved in the biosynthesis of deterrent alkaloids in reproductive tissues or in generating chemical signals involved in pollen tube guidance. a heterologous cdna probe from petunia hybrida was used to isolate flavanone-3 beta-hydroxylase-encoding cdna clones from carnation (dianthus caryophyllus), china aster (callistephus chinensis) and stock (matthiola incana). the deduced protein sequences together with the known sequences of the enzyme from p. hybrida, barley (hordeum vulgare) and snapdragon (antirrhinum majus) enabled the determination of a consensus sequence which revealed an overall 84% similarity (53% identity) of flavanone 3 beta-hydroxylases from the different sources. alignment with the sequences of other known enzymes of the same class and to related non-heme iron-(ii) enzymes demonstrated the strict genetic conservation of 14 amino acids, in particular, of three histidines and an aspartic acid. the conservation of the histidine motifs provides strong support for the possible conservation of structurally similar iron-binding sites in these enzymes. the putative role of histidines as chelators of ferrous ions in the active site of flavanone 3 beta-hydroxylases was corroborated by diethyl-pyrocarbonate modification of the partially purified recombinant petunia enzyme.
as participation in wheelchair sports increases, the need of quantitative assessment of biomechanical performance indicators and of sports- and population-specific training protocols has become central. the present study focuses on junior wheelchair basketball and aims at (i) proposing a method to identify biomechanical performance indicators of wheelchair propulsion using an instrumented in-field test and (ii) developing a training program specific for the considered population and assessing its efficacy using the proposed method. twelve athletes (10 m, 2 f, age = 17.1 ± 2.7 years, years of practice = 4.5 ± 1.8) equipped with wheelchair- and wrist-mounted inertial sensors performed a 20-metre sprint test. biomechanical parameters related to propulsion timing, progression force, and coordination were estimated from the measured accelerations and used in a regression model where the time to complete the test was set as dependent variable. force- and coordination-related parameters accounted for 80% of the dependent variable variance. based on these results, a training program was designed and administered for three months to six of the athletes (the others acting as control group). the biomechanical indicators proved to be effective in providing additional information about the wheelchair propulsion technique with respect to the final test outcome and demonstrated the efficacy of the developed program. magnetic and inertial measurement units are an emerging technology to obtain 3d orientation of body segments in human movement analysis. in this respect, sensor fusion is used to limit the drift errors resulting from the gyroscope data integration by exploiting accelerometer and magnetic aiding sensors. the present study aims at investigating the effectiveness of sensor fusion methods under different experimental conditions. manual and locomotion tasks, differing in time duration, measurement volume, presence/absence of static phases, and out-of-plane movements, were performed by six subjects, and recorded by one unit located on the forearm or the lower trunk, respectively. two sensor fusion methods, representative of the stochastic (extended kalman filter) and complementary (non-linear observer) filtering, were selected, and their accuracy was assessed in terms of attitude (pitch and roll angles) and heading (yaw angle) errors using stereophotogrammetric data as a reference. the sensor fusion approaches provided significantly more accurate results than gyroscope data integration. accuracy improved mostly for heading and when the movement exhibited stationary phases, evenly distributed 3d rotations, it occurred in a small volume, and its duration was greater than approximately 20 s. these results were independent from the specific sensor fusion method used. practice guidelines for improving the outcome accuracy are provided.
the objective of this study was to analyze the impact of family history of suicidal behaviour on psychopathlogical features of inmates. a sample of 1,179 prisoners had a psychiatric interview including the brown-goodwin assessment for lifetime history of aggression (bglha). prisoners completed the barratt impulsivity scale (bis), buss-durkee hostility inventory (bdhi), and eysenck personality questionnaire (epq). prisoners with a family history of suicide were compared with prisoners without a family history of suicide on clinical and personality variables. seventy of the 1,179 prisoners (5.9%) had a family history of suicide. significantly more fhs positive prisoners had attempted suicide compared with fhs negative prisoners (36% vs. 12%, p < 0.0001). significantly more fhs positive prisoners had a previous history of convictions, a history of juvenile convictions, and had exhibited aggressive behavior in jail. fhs positive prisoners had significantly higher aggression scores on the bglha, higher hostility scores on the bdhi, higher impulsivity scores on the bis, and higher neuroticism scores on the epq. a family history of suicide may be a useful clinical indicator that a prisoner is at increased risk for suicidal behaviour and may have problems with impulsive-aggression. two orthogonal personality traits or predispositions, impulsiveness and anxiety, have been invariant in five separate factor analyses. one of these analyses is presented here along with an item analysis of the barratt impulsiveness scale (bis) which has a high loading on the impulsiveness factor. the bis has never significantly correlated with any of the various anxiety or emotional stability measures in over 50 administrations of the scale, further evidence for the invariance of these two second-order factors.
objective to compare genitourinary health problems of children and adolescents with a substantiated report of sexual abuse with those of the general pediatric population. study design via a prospective matched‐cohort design, administrative databases between january 1996 and march 2013 were used to document genitourinary problems of 882 sexually abused children and those of 882 matched controls. generalized linear mixed models determined the association between a substantiated sexual abuse and diagnoses for sexually transmitted infections and urinary and genital health problems. results adjusted results revealed that up to 12 years after a sexual abuse was substantiated, abused girls had, respectively, 2.1 and 1.4 times more diagnoses for urinary and genital health problems compared with girls from the general population, whereas no difference was found for sexually transmitted infections. sexually abused boys had an equivalent number of diagnoses as those from the general population for all 3 outcomes. depending on the genitourinary health problem, abused girls and those from the general population had between 2.5 and 11 times more diagnoses than abused boys or those from the general population. conclusions this study showed that substantiated childhood sexual abuse is associated with more urinary and genital health problems among girls but not boys. early prevention and intervention efforts may mitigate the problems such that they do not persist or worsen over time and into adulthood. purpose to estimate the likelihood that a recent cohort of children would be exposed to sexual abuse and sexual assault by age 17 in the united states.   methods this analysis draws on three very similarly designed national telephone surveys of youth in 2003, 2008, and 2011, resulting in a pooled sample of 708 17-year-olds, 781 15-year-olds, and 804 16-year-olds.   results the lifetime experience of 17-year-olds with sexual abuse and sexual assault was 26.6% (95% confidence interval [ci] 19.8-33.5) for girls and 5.1% (95% ci 2.6-7.6) for boys. the lifetime experience with sexual abuse and sexual assault at the hands of adult perpetrators exclusively was 11.2% (95% ci 6.4-16.1) for females and 1.9% (95% ci .5-3.4) for males. for females, considerable risk for sexual abuse and assault was concentrated in late adolescence, as the rate rose from 16.8% (95% ci 11.5-22.2) for 15-year-old females to 26.6% (95% ci 19.8-33.5) for 17-year-old females. for males, it rose from 4.3% (95% ci 1.9-6.8) at 15 years to 5.1% (2.6-7.6) at 17 years.   conclusions self-report surveys in late adolescence reveal high rates of lifetime experience with sexual abuse and sexual assault at the hands of both adults and peers. because of high continuing victimization during the late teen years, assessments are most complete when conducted among the oldest youth.
this paper reports on the results from a series of psychoacoustic experiments in the field of the auditory representation of texts via synthetic speech which comprise similar acoustic patterns so called "paronyms". the errors which occur when listening to paronyms are classified as errors of phonological type. thirty blind and thirty sighted students participated in psychoacoustic experiments. the results from the experiments depicted the types of the subjects' errors and addressed comparisons between the performances of blind and sighted students on their auditory distinctions towards the chosen scripts (paronym words and sentences with paronyms). the discussion considered the practical implications of the findings such as issues regarding education as well as the development of suitable design of acoustic rendition of texts in favor of better perception and comprehension. in this paper we present the design and development of a modular and scalable speech composer named demosthenes. it has been designed for converting plain or formatted text (e.g. hmtl) to a combination of speech and audio signals. demosthenes' architecture constitutes an extension to current text-to-speech systems’ structure that enables an open set of module-defined functions to interact with the under processing text at any stage of the text-tospeech conversion. details on its implementation are given here. furthermore, we present some techniques for text handling and prosody generation using demosthenes.
chronic β-adrenoceptor antagonist (β-blocker) treatment in patients is associated with a potentially anti-arrhythmic prolongation of the atrial action potential duration (apd), which may involve remodelling of repolarising k+ currents. the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of chronic β-blockade on transient outward, sustained and inward rectifier k+ currents (ito, iksus and ik1) in human atrial myocytes and on the expression of underlying ion channel subunits. ion currents were recorded from human right atrial isolated myocytes using the whole-cell-patch clamp technique. tissue mrna and protein levels were measured using real time rt-pcr and western blotting. chronic β-blockade was associated with a 41% reduction in ito density: 9.3 ± 0.8 (30 myocytes, 15 patients) vs 15.7 ± 1.1 pa/pf (32, 14), p < 0.05; without affecting its voltage-, time- or rate dependence. ik1 was reduced by 34% at −120 mv (p < 0.05). neither iksus, nor its increase by acute β-stimulation with isoprenaline, was affected by chronic β-blockade. mathematical modelling suggested that the combination of ito- and ik1-decrease could result in a 28% increase in apd90. chronic β-blockade did not alter mrna or protein expression of the ito pore-forming subunit, kv4.3, or mrna expression of the accessory subunits kchip2, kchap, kvβ1, kvβ2 or frequenin. there was no reduction in mrna expression of kir2.1 or twik to account for the reduction in ik1. a reduction in atrial ito and ik1 associated with chronic β-blocker treatment in patients may contribute to the associated action potential prolongation, and this cannot be explained by a reduction in expression of associated ion channel subunits. objective to investigate changes in human atrial single cell functional electrophysiological properties associated with chronic atrial fibrillation (af), and the contribution to these of accompanying ion current changes.   methods the whole cell patch clamp technique was used to record action potentials, the effective refractory period (erp) and ion currents, in the absence and presence of drugs, in enzymatically isolated myocytes from 11 patients with chronic (>6 months) af and 39 patients in sinus rhythm.   results stimulation at high rates (up to 600 beats/min) markedly shortened late repolarisation and the erp in cells from patients in sinus rhythm, and depolarised the maximum diastolic potential (mdp). chronic af was associated with a reduction in the erp at physiological rate (from 203+/-16 to 104+/-15 ms, p<0.05), and marked attenuation in rate effects on the erp and repolarisation. the abbreviated terminal phase of repolarisation prevented fast rate-induced depolarisation of the mdp in cells from patients with af. the density of l-type ca(2+) (i(cal)) and transient outward k(+) (i(to)) currents was significantly reduced in cells from patients with af (by 60-65%), whilst the inward rectifier k(+) current (i(k1)) was increased, and the sustained outward current (i(ksus)) was unaltered. superfusion of cells from patients in sinus rhythm with nifedipine (10 micromol/l) moderately shortened repolarisation, but had no effect on the erp (228+/-12 vs. 225+/-11 ms). 4-aminopyridine (2 mmol/l) markedly prolonged repolarisation and the erp (by 35%, p<0.05). however, the combination of these drugs had no effect on late repolarisation or refractoriness.   conclusion chronic af in humans is associated with attenuation in adaptation of the atrial single cell erp and mdp to fast rates, which may not be explained fully by accompanying changes in i(cal) and i(to).
backgroundambulatory surgery has recently gain popularity, as it is a good method of optimizing hospital resources utilization. to support ambulatory surgery, anaesthetic goals now revolve around patients’ early recovery with minimal pain and nausea, expedient discharge home and prompt resumption of activities of daily living. in this study, we evaluated the effect of a single pre-induction dose of dexmedetomidine on anaesthetic requirements, postoperative pain and clinical recovery after ambulatory ureteroscopy andureteric stenting under general anaesthesia.methodssixty patients were randomised to receive iv dexmedetomidine 0.5 μg.kg-1 (group dex, n = 30) or iv saline (group p, n = 30). general anaesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane: oxygen: air, titrated to bis 40–60. pain intensity, sedation, rescue analgesics, nausea/vomiting and resumption of daily activities were recorded at 1 h, and postoperative day (pod) 1–5.resultsgroup dex patients had significant reduction in sevoflurane minimum alveolar concentration (mac), mean (sd) dex vs. placebo 0.6 (0.2) vs. 0.9 (0.1), p = 0.037; reduced postoperative resting pain at 1 h (vas 0–10) (mean (sd) 1.00 (1.84) vs. 2.63 (2.78), p = 0.004), pod 1 (mean (sd) 1.50 (1.48) vs. 2.87 (2.72), p = 0.002), pod 2 (0.53 (0.97) vs. 1.73 (1.96), p = 0.001) and pod 3 (0.30 (0.75) vs. 0.89 (1.49), p = 0.001). dex patients also had less pain on movement pod 1 (3.00 (2.12) vs. 4.30 (3.10), p = 0.043) and pod 2 (2.10 (1.98) vs. 3.10 (2.46), p = 0.040), with higher resumption of daily activities by 48 h compared to placebo, 87% vs. 63%, p = 0.04.conclusionswe conclude that a single dose of dexmedetomidine was a useful adjuvant in reducing mac and postoperative pain (at 1 h and pod 1–3), facilitating faster return to daily activities by 48 h.trial registrationthe australian new zealand clinical trials registry (anzctr), actrn12617001120369, 31st july 2017, retrospectively registered. alphaxalone-alphadolone (althesin), diluted and administered as a controlled infusion, was used as a sedative for 30 patients in an intensive therapy unit. this technique allowed rapid and accurate control of the level of sedation. it had three particularly useful applications: it provided “light sleep,” allowed rapid variation in the level of sedation, and enabled repeated assessment of the central nervous system. sedation was satisfactory for 86% of the total time, and no serious complications were attributed to the use of the drug. furthermore, though alphaxalone-alphadolone was given for periods up to 20 days there was no evidence of tachyphylaxis or delay in recovery time.
process evaluation is an assessment of the implementation of an intervention. a process evaluation component was embedded in the healthy study, a primary prevention trial for type 2 diabetes implemented over 3 years in 21 middle schools across the united states. the healthy physical education (pe) intervention aimed at maximizing student engagement in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity through delivery of structured lesson plans by pe teachers. process evaluation data collected via class observations and interventionist interviews assessed fidelity, dose delivered, implementor participation, dose received and barriers. process evaluation results indicate a high level of fidelity in implementing healthy pe activities and offering 225 min of pe every 10 school days. concerning dose delivered, students were active for approximately 33 min of class, representing an average of 61% of the class time. results also indicate that pe teachers were generally engaged in implementing the healthy pe curriculum. data on dose received showed that students were highly engaged with the pe intervention; however, student misbehavior was the most common barrier observed during classes. other barriers included teacher disengagement, large classes, limited gym space and poor classroom management. findings suggest that the pe intervention was generally implemented and received as intended despite several barriers. the healthy primary prevention trial was designed and implemented in response to the growing numbers of children and adolescents being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. the objective was to moderate risk factors for type 2 diabetes. modifiable risk factors measured were indicators of adiposity and glycemic dysregulation: body mass index ⩾85th percentile, fasting glucose ⩾5.55 mmol l−1 (100 mg per 100 ml) and fasting insulin ⩾180 pmol l−1 (30 μu ml−1). a series of pilot studies established the feasibility of performing data collection procedures and tested the development of an intervention consisting of four integrated components: (1) changes in the quantity and nutritional quality of food and beverage offerings throughout the total school food environment; (2) physical education class lesson plans and accompanying equipment to increase both participation and number of minutes spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity; (3) brief classroom activities and family outreach vehicles to increase knowledge, enhance decision-making skills and support and reinforce youth in accomplishing goals; and (4) communications and social marketing strategies to enhance and promote changes through messages, images, events and activities. expert study staff provided training, assistance, materials and guidance for school faculty and staff to implement the intervention components. a cohort of students were enrolled in sixth grade and followed to end of eighth grade. they attended a health screening data collection at baseline and end of study that involved measurement of height, weight, blood pressure, waist circumference and a fasting blood draw. height and weight were also collected at the end of the seventh grade. the study was conducted in 42 middle schools, six at each of seven locations across the country, with 21 schools randomized to receive the intervention and 21 to act as controls (data collection activities only). middle school was the unit of sample size and power computation, randomization, intervention and primary analysis.
background insulin resistance is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease progression. current diagnostic tests, such as glycemic indicators, have limitations in the early detection of insulin resistant individuals. we searched for novel biomarkers identifying these at-risk subjects. methods using mass spectrometry, non-targeted biochemical profiling was conducted in a cohort of 399 nondiabetic subjects representing a broad spectrum of insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance (based on the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp and oral glucose tolerance testing, respectively). results random forest statistical analysis selected α-hydroxybutyrate (α–hb) as the top-ranked biochemical for separating insulin resistant (lower third of the clamp-derived mffm = 33 [12] µmol·min−1·kgffm −1, median [interquartile range], n = 140) from insulin sensitive subjects (mffm = 66 [23] µmol·min−1·kgffm −1) with a 76% accuracy. by targeted isotope dilution assay, plasma α–hb concentrations were reciprocally related to mffm; and by partition analysis, an α–hb value of 5 µg/ml was found to best separate insulin resistant from insulin sensitive subjects. α–hb also separated subjects with normal glucose tolerance from those with impaired fasting glycemia or impaired glucose tolerance independently of, and in an additive fashion to, insulin resistance. these associations were also independent of sex, age and bmi. other metabolites from this global analysis that significantly correlated to insulin sensitivity included certain organic acid, amino acid, lysophospholipid, acylcarnitine and fatty acid species. several metabolites are intermediates related to α-hb metabolism and biosynthesis. conclusions α–hydroxybutyrate is an early marker for both insulin resistance and impaired glucose regulation. the underlying biochemical mechanisms may involve increased lipid oxidation and oxidative stress. to address the challenges associated with metabolomics analyses, such as identification of chemical structures and elimination of experimental artifacts, we developed a platform that integrated the chemical analysis, including identification and relative quantification, data reduction, and quality assurance components of the process. the analytical platform incorporated two separate ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (uhplc/ms/ms(2)) injections; one injection was optimized for basic species, and the other was optimized for acidic species. this approach permitted the detection of 339 small molecules, a total instrument analysis time of 24 min (two injections at 12 min each), while maintaining a median process variability of 9%. the resulting ms/ms(2) data were searched against an in-house generated authentic standard library that included retention time, molecular weight (m/z), preferred adducts, and in-source fragments as well as their associated ms/ms spectra for all molecules in the library. the library allowed the rapid and high-confidence identification of the experimentally detected molecules based on a multiparameter match without need for additional analyses. this integrated platform enabled the high-throughput collection and relative quantitative analysis of analytical data and identified a large number and broad spectrum of molecules with a high degree of confidence.
inhibition of the mitochondrial release and nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (aif) by heat stress protein (hsp)72 may ameliorate apoptosis in renal epithelial cells exposed to a metabolic inhibitor. to evaluate this hypothesis, cells were transiently exposed to 5 mm sodium cyanide in the absence of medium glucose, a maneuver known to induce apoptosis. atp depletion for 1-2 h resulted in the progressive accumulation of mitochondrial aif in the cytosol of samples obtained by selectively permeabilizing the plasma membrane with digitonin. during recovery from atp depletion, time-dependent nuclear aif accumulation (but not cytochrome c, an f0f1 atp synthase subunit, or talin) was observed in isolated nuclei. nuclear aif accumulation was associated with peripheral chromatin condensation and dna degradation. prior heat stress (hs) significantly reduced aif leakage into the cytosol, decreased nuclear accumulation of aif, and inhibited dna degradation. hs also increased the interaction between aif and hsp72 detected by immunoprecipitation. in atp depleted cells, selective overexpression of human hsp72 reduced the leakage of mitochondrial aif in a dose-dependent manner (r = 0.997). this study suggests that mitochondrial membrane injury and subsequent aif release contribute to nuclear injury and apoptosis in atp-depleted renal cells. hsp72, an antiapoptotic protein, inhibits cell injury in part by preventing mitochondrial aif release and perhaps by decreasing its nuclear accumulation. the events that precipitate cell death and the stress proteins responsible for cytoprotection during atp depletion remain elusive. we hypothesize that exposure to metabolic inhibitors damages mitochondria, allowing proapoptotic proteins to leak into the cytosol, and suggest that heat stress-induced hsp72 accumulation prevents mitochondrial membrane injury. to test these hypotheses, renal epithelial cells were transiently atp depleted with sodium cyanide and 2-deoxy-d-glucose in the absence of medium dextrose. recovery from atp depletion was associated with the release into the cytosol of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (aif), proapoptotic proteins that localize to the intermitochondrial membrane space. concomitant with mitochondrial cytochrome c leak, a seven- to eightfold increase in caspase 3 activity was observed. in controls, state iii mitochondrial respiration was reduced by 30% after transient exposure to metabolic inhibitors. prior heat stress preserved mitochondrial atp production and significantly reduced both cytochrome c release and caspase 3 activation. despite less cytochrome c release, prior heat stress increased binding between cytochrome c and hsp72. the present study demonstrates that mitochondrial injury accompanies exposure to metabolic inhibitors. by reducing outer mitochondrial membrane injury and by complexing with cytochrome c, hsp72 could inhibit caspase activation and subsequent apoptosis.
tgf-β induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which occurs during tumor cell invasiveness in pathological state, in limited cells. as a first step to understand the role of tgf-β and the structurally related activin during melanoma metastasis, expression of metastasis-related genes was examined in murine melanoma cells. treatment with tgf-β1 or activin a down-regulated e-cadherin in b16 cells in a dose-dependent manner. in epithelial cells, tgf-β-induced high mobility group a2 (hmga2) gene product is suggested to down-regulate e-cadherin through up-regulation of zinc-finger transcription factors slug and snail, and basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor twist. unlike the regulation in epithelial cells, tgf-β1 treatment rather decreased mrna expression of hmga2, indicating a distinct mechanism on tgf-β/activin-induced down-regulation. transfection of double-stranded interfering rna (dsrnai) for activin receptor-like kinase (alk) type i receptors revealed that alk5, a prototype of tgf-β receptor, mainly transmits tgf-β signals on the e-cadherin down-regulation at the mrna level, and that a prototype receptor alk4 elicited the activin effect. tgf-β/activin potentiated down-regulation of e-cadherin and hmga2 also in b16 sublines that are susceptible to metastasis. however, the extent of down-regulation tended to be smaller, and less smad2, a signal mediator for tgf-β/activin, was phosphorylated in response to the ligand, resulting from less expression of type i receptors in the b16 sublines. these results suggest that the receptor expression level determines strength of the signals for tgf-β/activin through phosphorylation of smad2, which explains pluripotency of the ligand family partly. smad transcription factors lie at the core of one of the most versatile cytokine signaling pathways in metazoan biology-the transforming growth factor-beta (tgfbeta) pathway. recent progress has shed light into the processes of smad activation and deactivation, nucleocytoplasmic dynamics, and assembly of transcriptional complexes. a rich repertoire of regulatory devices exerts control over each step of the smad pathway. this knowledge is enabling work on more complex questions about the organization, integration, and modulation of smad-dependent transcriptional programs. we are beginning to uncover self-enabled gene response cascades, graded smad response mechanisms, and smad-dependent synexpression groups. our growing understanding of tgfbeta signaling through the smad pathway provides general principles for how animal cells translate complex inputs into concrete behavior.
objective quantification of the maximum anatomical cross-sectional area of the lumbar back muscles as a function of torso flexion angle and development of prediction equations as a function of torso flexion and anthropometric measures.   background cross-sectional areas of the lumbar back muscles used as inputs into biomechanical models have traditionally been derived from subjects lying in the neutral supine posture. however, it is known that the cross-sectional area of muscle is altered as the torso angle changes.   design experimental design consisted of a two-factor multivariate analysis of variance on the cross-sectional area of the lumbar torso muscle across the lumbar levels, as a function of gender and torso angle. hierarchical linear regression was utilized to assess the association between cross-sectional area and individual and torso posture characteristics.   method axial mri scans, through and parallel to each of the lumbar intervertebral discs at four torso flexion positions were obtained from subjects in a lateral recumbent posture. cross-sectional areas were quantified and converted into anatomical cross-sectional areas utilizing known fascicle orientations.   results the maximum anatomical cross-sectional area was located between the l(3)/l(4) and l(4)/l(5) level in the neutral posture. the anatomical cross-sectional areas at the l(4)/l(5) and l(5)/s(1) decreased during torso flexion, however, the percent change varied as a function of the individual level. the majority of the anatomical cross-sectional area variability was explained by gender and body mass. lumbar curvature explained a larger proportion of the anatomical cross-sectional area variability at the lower lumbar levels than at the higher lumbar levels.   conclusions the maximum anatomical cross-sectional area of the lumbar back muscles occur at the neutral torso posture and did not decrease as a function of torso flexion. when using maximum anatomical cross-sectional area or specific lumbar level anatomical cross-sectional areas, it appears necessary to account for gender and body mass. at the lower lumbar levels, knowledge of spinal curvature plays an increasing role in the estimation of the size of the lumbar torso muscle cross-sectional area.   relevance this research indicates the lower lumbar level trunk muscle anatomical cross-sectional area decrease as torso flexion increases, however, the maximum lumbar trunk muscle anatomical cross-sectional area does not vary as a function of torso flexion. accounting for gender, body mass, torso characteristics and lumbar curvature may help increase accuracy of anatomical cross-sectional area prediction, as well as muscle force predictions from biomechanical models. the attachments and orientation of every fascicle of the lumbar erector spinae were determined in five cadavers and recorded radiographically. little variation was found in the sites of muscle attachment, which enabled the construction of maps whereby these sites could be plotted on clinical radiographs or models of the lumbar spine. when all fascicles were plotted on 21 clinical radiographs using the maps previously developed, no significant difference in the orientation of fascicles was found compared with that observed in cadavers. this result vindicates the technique used to plot the location of individual fascicles of the lumbar back muscles.
algorithms for computing matrix functions are typically tested by comparing the forward error with the product of the condition number and the unit roundoff. the forward error is computed with the aid of a reference solution, typically computed at high precision. an alternative approach is to use functional identities such as the “round-trip tests” eloga = a and (a1/p)p = a, as are currently employed in a scipy test module. we show how a linearized perturbation analysis for a functional identity allows the determination of a maximum residual consistent with backward stability of the constituent matrix function evaluations. comparison of this maximum residual with a computed residual provides a necessary test for backward stability. we also show how the actual linearized backward error for these relations can be computed. our approach makes use of fréchet derivatives and estimates of their norms. numerical experiments show that the proposed approaches are able both to detect instability and to confirm stability. an algorithm for computing matrix functions is presented. it employs a schur decomposition with reordering and blocking followed by the block form of a recurrence of parlett, with functions of the nontrivial diagonal blocks evaluated via a taylor series. a parameter is used to balance the conflicting requirements of producing small diagonal blocks and keeping the separations of the blocks large. the algorithm is intended primarily for functions having a taylor series with an infinite radius of convergence, but it can be adapted for certain other functions, such as the logarithm. novel features introduced here include a convergence test that avoids premature termination of the taylor series evaluation and an algorithm for reordering and blocking the schur form. numerical experiments show that the algorithm is competitive with existing special-purpose algorithms for the matrix exponential, logarithm, and cosine. nevertheless, the algorithm can be numerically unstable with the default choice of its blocking parameter (or in certain cases for all choices), and we explain why determining the optimal parameter appears to be a very difficult problem. a matlab implementation is available that is much more reliable than the function funm in matlab 6.5 (r13).
backgroundcucurbitaceae species contain a significantly lower number of genes coding for proteins with similarity to plant resistance genes belonging to the nbs-lrr family than other plant species of similar genome size. a large proportion of these genes are organized in clusters that appear to be hotspots of variability. the genomes of the cucurbitaceae species measured until now are intermediate in size (between 350 and 450 mb) and they apparently have not undergone any genome duplications beside those at the origin of eudicots. the cluster containing the largest number of nbs-lrr genes has previously been analyzed in melon and related species and showed a high degree of interspecific and intraspecific variability. it was of interest to study whether similar behavior occurred in other cluster of the same family of genes.resultsthe cluster of nbs-lrr genes located in melon chromosome 9 was analyzed and compared with the syntenic regions in other cucurbit genomes. this is the second cluster in number within this species and it contains nine sequences with a nbs-lrr annotation including two genes, fom1 and prv, providing resistance against fusarium and ppapaya ring-spot virus (prsv). the variability within the melon species appears to consist essentially of single nucleotide polymorphisms. clusters of similar genes are present in the syntenic regions of the two species of cucurbitaceae that were sequenced, cucumber and watermelon. most of the genes in the syntenic clusters can be aligned between species and a hypothesis of generation of the cluster is proposed. the number of genes in the watermelon cluster is similar to that in melon while a higher number of genes (12) is present in cucumber, a species with a smaller genome than melon. after comparing genome resequencing data of 115 cucumber varieties, deletion of a group of genes is observed in a group of varieties of indian origin.conclusionsclusters of genes coding for nbs-lrr proteins in cucurbits appear to have specific variability in different regions of the genome and between different species. this observation is in favour of considering that the adaptation of plant species to changing environments is based upon the variability that may occur at any location in the genome and that has been produced by specific mechanisms of sequence variation acting on plant genomes. this information could be useful both to understand the evolution of species and for plant breeding. mcscan is an algorithm able to scan multiple genomes or subgenomes in order to identify putative homologous chromosomal regions, and align these regions using genes as anchors. the mcscanx toolkit implements an adjusted mcscan algorithm for detection of synteny and collinearity that extends the original software by incorporating 14 utility programs for visualization of results and additional downstream analyses. applications of mcscanx to several sequenced plant genomes and gene families are shown as examples. mcscanx can be used to effectively analyze chromosome structural changes, and reveal the history of gene family expansions that might contribute to the adaptation of lineages and taxa. an integrated view of various modes of gene duplication can supplement the traditional gene tree analysis in specific families. the source code and documentation of mcscanx are freely available at http://chibba.pgml.uga.edu/mcscan2/.
purpose to characterize the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (timps) by induced pluripotent stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelium (ips-rpe) during wound healing. we hypothesize that ips-rpe secretes mediators of tissue remodeling such as mmps and timps to promote migration and proliferation of cells during wound healing.   methods ips-rpe was grown on transwells until fully confluent and pigmented. the monolayers were scratched to induce a wound. conditioned media were collected from the apical and basolateral sides of the transwells every 72 h for 12 days. the media were analyzed by multiplex elisa assays to detect secreted mmps and timps. activity assays were performed to detect the active form of mmp-2 in conditioned media.   results mmp-2 and timp-1, -2, -3, and -4 were detected in conditioned media from ips-rpe. the proteins were found to be secreted in a polarized manner. the apical secretion and activation of mmp-2 was elevated from days 3 to 12 after wounding. timp-1, -2, -3, and -4 were detected in conditioned media from both the apical and basolateral sides of wounded cells. apical secretion of all 4 timps increased within 3 days after wounding.   conclusions these results indicate that ips-rpe secretes mmp-2 and all 4 timps in a polarized manner. after wounding, apical secretion of mmp-2 was higher compared to control. apical secretion of all 4 timps increased compared to control, while only timp-1 showed increased basolateral secretion compared to control. pluripotent stem cells possess the ability to proliferate indefinitely and to differentiate into almost any cell type. additionally, the development of techniques to reprogram somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem (ips) cells has generated interest and excitement towards the possibility of customized personal regenerative medicine. however, the efficiency of stem cell differentiation towards a desired lineage remains low. the purpose of this study is to describe a protocol to derive retinal pigment epithelium (rpe) from ips cells (ips-rpe) by applying a tissue engineering approach to generate homogenous populations of embryoid bodies (ebs), a common intermediate during in vitro differentiation. the protocol applies the formation of specific size of ebs using microwell plate technology. the methods for identifying protein and gene markers of rpe by immunocytochemistry and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) are also explained. finally, the efficiency of differentiation in different sizes of ebs monitored by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (facs) analysis of rpe markers is described. these techniques will facilitate the differentiation of ips cells into rpe for future applications.
background ephx1 is a key enzyme in metabolizing some exogenous carcinogens such as products of cigarette-smoking. two functional polymorphisms in the ephx1 gene, tyr113his and his139arg can alter the enzyme activity, suggesting their possible association with carcinogenesis risk, particularly of some tobacco-related cancers. methodology/principal findings a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis was performed of available studies on these two polymorphisms and cancer risk published up to november 2010, consisting of 84 studies (31144 cases and 42439 controls) for tyr113his and 77 studies (28496 cases and 38506 controls) for his139arg primarily focused on lung cancer, upper aerodigestive tract (uadt) cancers (including oral, pharynx, larynx and esophagus cancers), colorectal cancer or adenoma, bladder cancer and breast cancer. results showed that y113h low activity allele (h) was significantly associated with decreased risk of lung cancer (or = 0.88, 95%ci = 0.80–0.96) and uadt cancers (or = 0.86, 95%ci = 0.77–0.97) and h139r high activity allele (r) with increased risk of lung cancer (or = 1.18, 95%ci = 1.04–1.33) but not of uadt cancers (or = 1.05, 95%ci = 0.93–1.17). pooled analysis of lung and uadt cancers revealed that low ephx1 enzyme activity, predicted by the combination of y113h and h139r showed decreased risk of these cancers (or = 0.83, 95%ci = 0.75–0.93) whereas high ephx1 activity increased risk of the cancers (or = 1.20, 95%ci = 0.98–1.46). furthermore, modest difference for the risk of lung and uadt cancers was found between cigarette smokers and nonsmokers both in single snp analyses (low activity allele h: or = 0.77/0.85 for smokers/nonsmokers; high activity allele r: or = 1.20/1.09 for smokers/nonsmokers) and in combined double snp analyses (putative low activity: or = 0.73/0.88 for smokers/nonsmokers; putative high activity: or = 1.02/0.93 for smokers/ nonsmokers). conclusions/significance putative low ephx1 enzyme activity may have a potential protective effect on tobacco-related carcinogenesis of lung and uadt cancers, whereas putative high ephx1 activity may have a harmful effect. moreover, cigarette-smoking status may influence the association of ephx1 enzyme activity and the related cancer risk. exposure to aflatoxins is a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). aflatoxins occur in peanut butter and are metabolized by genetically polymorphic enzymes such as glutathione-s-transferases encoded by glutathione-s-transferase mu 1 gene (gstm1) and glutathione-s-transferase theta 1 gene (gstt1) and microsomal epoxide hydrolase encoded by epoxide hydrolase gene (ephx). the rate at which aflatoxins become activated or detoxified may depend on polymorphisms in the encoding genes. gstm1 homozygous deletion was indeed found to modify the association between peanut butter consumption and hcc. in this study, we investigate possible roles of gstt1 and ephx polymorphisms in this relationship. from a sudanese case-control study on hcc, we analyzed data of 112 incident cases and 194 controls. all participants were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire inquiring about social and demographic factors, peanut butter consumption, and other known hcc risk factors. univariate analysis showed that gstt1 polymorphism was not associated with hcc, whereas ephx 113hh and 139hh genotypes increased the risk of hcc (odds ratio, 3.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-8.12). adjustment for age and region of origin slightly attenuated this association (odds ratio, 2.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.83-7.95). interestingly, unlike gstm1, both gstt1 and ephx polymorphism did not modify the association between peanut butter consumption and hcc. in conclusion, these epidemiological findings do not suggest significant roles of gstt1 and ephx in aflatoxin metabolism, although ephx polymorphism is possibly related to the increased risk of hcc. further studies are needed to investigate mechanisms by which the ephx polymorphism potentially modifies cancer risk.
cancer immunotherapy has gained significant momentum from recent clinical successes of checkpoint blockade inhibition. massively parallel sequence analysis suggests a connection between mutational load and response to this class of therapy. methods to identify which tumor-specific mutant peptides (neoantigens) can elicit anti-tumor t cell immunity are needed to improve predictions of checkpoint therapy response and to identify targets for vaccines and adoptive t cell therapies. here, we present a flexible, streamlined computational workflow for identification of personalized variant antigens by cancer sequencing (pvac-seq) that integrates tumor mutation and expression data (dna- and rna-seq). pvac-seq is available at https://github.com/griffithlab/pvac-seq. the human leukocyte antigen (hla) is key to many aspects of human physiology and medicine. all current sequence-based hla typing methodologies are targeted approaches requiring the amplification of specific hla gene segments. whole genome, exome and transcriptome shotgun sequencing can generate prodigious data but due to the complexity of hla loci these data have not been immediately informative regarding hla genotype. we describe hlaminer, a computational method for identifying hla alleles directly from shotgun sequence datasets (http://www.bcgsc.ca/platform/bioinfo/software/hlaminer). this approach circumvents the additional time and cost of generating hla-specific data and capitalizes on the increasing accessibility and affordability of massively parallel sequencing.
in asynchronous event systems, the production of an event is decoupled from its consumption via an event queue. the loose coupling of such systems allows great flexibility as to where and when within the system the event handler of a given event is actually executed, allowing them to scale with increasing number of processors on a given node or across multiple nodes in a distributed system. although this flexibility is useful in heterogeneous distributed systems, such as soa, it may appear not to be well suited for real-time systems, which require an upper bound on how long an event can remain unhandled in a queue. however, we show how the weighted fair scheduling algorithms developed for qos (quality of service) routing can be adapted to event queues to bound the delay between production and consumption. we achieve this, despite the fact that the underlying execution environment is only weakly controlled, through the use of predictive techniques on a calibrated model of the event system. our choice of algorithms and data structures is driven in part by the highly concurrent nature of the system. we show how a weighted fair scheduler can be built on a lock-free concurrent priority queue. we analyze the performance of various such queues proposed in the literature and show that a very simple linear quantizing queue yields the best performance. in this paper, we present an approach for qos management that can be applied to a general class of real-time distributed computation systems. in the proposed approach, a switching hybrid system model is used to represent the system. in this setting, the qos specifications are transformed into set-point specifications and a limited-horizon online supervisory controller is used to move the system to the optimal operation point.
quality assessment (qa) for predicted protein structural models is an important and challenging research problem in protein structure prediction. consensus global distance test (cgdt) methods assess each decoy (predicted structural model) based on its structural similarity to all others in a decoy set and has been proved to work well when good decoys are in a majority cluster. scoring functions evaluate each single decoy based on its structural properties. both methods have their merits and limitations. in this paper, we present a novel method called pwcom, which consists of two neural networks sequentially to combine cgdt and single model scoring methods such as rw, ddfire and opus-ca. specifically, for every pair of decoys, the difference of the corresponding feature vectors is input to the first neural network which enables one to predict whether the decoy-pair are significantly different in terms of their gdt scores to the native. if yes, the second neural network is used to decide which one of the two is closer to the native structure. the quality score for each decoy in the pool is based on the number of winning times during the pairwise comparisons. test results on three benchmark datasets from different model generation methods showed that pwcom significantly improves over consensus gdt and single scoring methods. the qa server (mufold-server) applying this method in casp 10 qa category was ranked the second place in terms of pearson and spearman correlation performance. for a successful analysis of the relation between amino acid sequence and protein structure, an unambiguous and physically meaningful definition of secondary structure is essential. we have developed a set of simple and physically motivated criteria for secondary structure, programmed as a pattern‐recognition process of hydrogen‐bonded and geometrical features extracted from x‐ray coordinates. cooperative secondary structure is recognized as repeats of the elementary hydrogen‐bonding patterns “turn” and “bridge.” repeating turns are “helices,” repeating bridges are “ladders,” connected ladders are “sheets.” geometric structure is defined in terms of the concepts torsion and curvature of differential geometry. local chain “chirality” is the torsional handedness of four consecutive cα positions and is positive for right‐handed helices and negative for ideal twisted β‐sheets. curved pieces are defined as “bends.” solvent “exposure” is given as the number of water molecules in possible contact with a residue. the end result is a compilation of the primary structure, including ss bonds, secondary structure, and solvent exposure of 62 different globular proteins. the presentation is in linear form: strip graphs for an overall view and strip tables for the details of each of 10.925 residues. the dictionary is also available in computer‐readable form for protein structure prediction work.
the human sense of smell is made possible through the use of the so-called olfactory receptors. these receptors are proteins which are embedded into the cellular membranes located in the nose. the olfactory receptors are members of the g protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs) class. the function of a gpcr is to transmit a signal into the cell structure when a molecule binds to the gpcr on the outside of the cellular membrane. the olfactory receptors are mostly found inside the nose. however a number of these receptors are also found on other locations. for this reason the olfactory receptors may also be involved in functions other than making the sense of smell possible. generally speaking, gpcrs are already essential in drug discovery. because of this the pharmacological importance to map the hidden function of the olfactory receptors may introduce new drug targets. the paper by samsonova et al. proposed a rule-based characterisation method for classifying olfactory receptors using multiple sequence alignment (msa). in a msa the olfactory receptor sequences can be compared with each other. this thesis continues the effort of finding characteristic amino acid combinations in olfactory gpcrs. two existing rule discovery algorithms, prism and tertius, are used in combination with two optimisation methods, rule set optimisation and rule subset generation. the combined methods found highly supported rule sets which classify the olfactory receptor class very successfully. moreover these rule sets cover multiple highly characteristic features in a non-sequential manner throughout the transmembrane (tm) domains of the olfactory receptors. in contrast with the well known motifs, which uses sequences of conserved amino acids in chronological order to classify a receptor class. the used characterisation methods in this thesis could be used to examine the characteristics of other gpcrs. furthermore these method could use other alignment methods such as a structural alignment. this could uncover important characterisations within the 3d structure which may lead to a better understanding of the functions of the olfactory receptor. 1. what's it all about? 2. input: concepts, instances, attributes 3. output: knowledge representation 4. algorithms: the basic methods 5. credibility: evaluating what's been learned 6. implementations: real machine learning schemes 7. moving on: engineering the input and output 8. nuts and bolts: machine learning algorithms in java 9. looking forward
this work is the first comprehensive analysis of the properties of word embeddings learned by neural machine translation (nmt) models trained on bilingual texts. we show the word representations of nmt models outperform those learned from monolingual text by established algorithms such as skipgram and cbow on tasks that require knowledge of semantic similarity and/or lexical–syntactic role. these effects hold when translating from english to french and english to german, and we argue that the desirable properties of nmt word embeddings should emerge largely independently of the source and target languages. further, we apply a recently-proposed heuristic method for training nmt models with very large vocabularies, and show that this vocabulary expansion method results in minimal degradation of embedding quality. this allows us to make a large vocabulary of nmt embeddings available for future research and applications. overall, our analyses indicate that nmt embeddings should be used in applications that require word concepts to be organised according to similarity and/or lexical function, while monolingual embeddings are better suited to modelling (nonspecific) inter-word relatedness. we propose a unified neural network architecture and learning algorithm that can be applied to various natural language processing tasks including part-of-speech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition, and semantic role labeling. this versatility is achieved by trying to avoid task-specific engineering and therefore disregarding a lot of prior knowledge. instead of exploiting man-made input features carefully optimized for each task, our system learns internal representations on the basis of vast amounts of mostly unlabeled training data. this work is then used as a basis for building a freely available tagging system with good performance and minimal computational requirements.
the base of semantic web specifications is resource description framework (rdf) as a standard for expressing metadata. rdf has a simple object model, allowing for easy design of knowledge bases. this implies that the size of knowledge bases can dramatically increase; therefore, it is necessary to take into account both scalability and space consumption when storing such bases. some theoretical results related to blank node semantics can be exploited in order to design techniques that optimize, among others, space requirements in storing rdf descriptions. we present an algorithm, called redd, that exploits these theoretical results and optimizes the space used by a rdf description. hp labs developed the jena toolkit to make it easier to develop applications that use the semantic web information model and languages. jena is a java application programming interface that is available as an open-source download from www.hpl.hp.com/semweb/jena-top.html.
backgroundcommon approaches to pathway analysis treat pathways merely as lists of genes disregarding their topological structures, that is, ignoring the genes' interactions on which a pathway's cellular function depends. in contrast, pathwave has been developed for the analysis of high-throughput gene expression data that explicitly takes the topology of networks into account to identify both global dysregulation of and localized (switch-like) regulatory shifts within metabolic and signaling pathways. for this purpose, it applies adjusted wavelet transforms on optimized 2d grid representations of curated pathway maps.resultshere, we present the new version of pathwave with several substantial improvements including a new method for optimally mapping pathway networks unto compact 2d lattice grids, a more flexible and user-friendly interface, and pre-arranged 2d grid representations. these pathway representations are assembled for several species now comprising h. sapiens, m. musculus, d. melanogaster, d. rerio, c. elegans, and e. coli. we show that pathwave is more sensitive than common approaches and apply it to rna-seq expression data, identifying crucial metabolic pathways in lung adenocarcinoma, as well as microarray expression data, identifying pathways involved in longevity of drosophila.conclusionspathwave is a generic method for pathway analysis complementing established tools like gsea, and the update comprises efficient new features. in contrast to the tested commonly applied approaches which do not take network topology into account, pathwave enables identifying pathways that are either known be involved in or very likely associated with such diverse conditions as human lung cancer or aging of d. melanogaster. the pathwave r package is freely available at http://www.ichip.de/software/pathwave.html. metabolism is a vital cellular process, and its malfunction is a major contributor to human disease. metabolic networks are complex and highly interconnected, and thus systems-level computational approaches are required to elucidate and understand metabolic genotype–phenotype relationships. we have manually reconstructed the global human metabolic network based on build 35 of the genome annotation and a comprehensive evaluation of >50 years of legacy data (i.e., bibliomic data). herein we describe the reconstruction process and demonstrate how the resulting genome-scale (or global) network can be used (i) for the discovery of missing information, (ii) for the formulation of an in silico model, and (iii) as a structured context for analyzing high-throughput biological data sets. our comprehensive evaluation of the literature revealed many gaps in the current understanding of human metabolism that require future experimental investigation. mathematical analysis of network structure elucidated the implications of intracellular compartmentalization and the potential use of correlated reaction sets for alternative drug target identification. integrated analysis of high-throughput data sets within the context of the reconstruction enabled a global assessment of functional metabolic states. these results highlight some of the applications enabled by the reconstructed human metabolic network. the establishment of this network represents an important step toward genome-scale human systems biology.
patients with chronic pancreatitis may have abnormal gastrointestinal transit, but the factors underlying these abnormalities are poorly understood. gastrointestinal transit was assessed, in 40 male outpatients with alcohol-related chronic pancreatitis and 18 controls, by scintigraphy after a liquid meal labeled with 99mtechnetium-phytate. blood and urinary glucose, fecal fat excretion, nutritional status, and cardiovascular autonomic function were determined in all patients. the influence of diabetes mellitus, malabsorption, malnutrition, and autonomic neuropathy on abnormal gastrointestinal transit was assessed by univariate analysis and bayesian multiple regression analysis. accelerated gastrointestinal transit was found in 11 patients who showed abnormally rapid arrival of the meal marker to the cecum. univariate and bayesian analysis showed that diabetes mellitus and autonomic neuropathy had significant influences on rapid transit, which was not associated with either malabsorption or malnutrition. in conclusion, rapid gastrointestinal transit in patients with alcohol-related chronic pancreatitis is related to diabetes mellitus and autonomic neuropathy. background: the pattern of progression of a meal from the stomach to the caecum in diabetes mellitus is controversial and the differential roles of transit through the jejunum and the ileum have not been investigated in diabetes. aims: to determine gastric emptying and transit rates through proximal and distal regions of the small bowel in type i diabetic patients. subjects: the study included six diabetic patients with evidence of autonomic neuropathy (dm-an group), 11 diabetics without autonomic dysfunction (dm group), and 15 control volunteers. methods: gastric emptying and small bowel transit of a liquid meal were evaluated scintigraphically in these subjects. transit through regions of interest corresponding to the proximal and distal small intestine up to the caecum was determined and correlated with gastric emptying rates, cardiovascular measurements of autonomic function, and the occurrence of diarrhoea. results: gastric emptying and transit through the proximal small bowel were similar in the three groups. the meal arrived to the caecum significantly earlier in dm-an patients (median; range: 55 min; 22-->180 min) than in the dm group (100 min; 44-->180 min, p < 0.05) or in controls (120 min; 80-->180 min, p < 0.02). accumulation of chyme in the distal small bowel was decreased in dm-an patients, who showed values for peak activity (30%; 10-55%) significantly lower than in the dm group (49%; 25-77%, p = 0.02) and controls (50%; 30-81%, p = 0.02). in dm patients (n = 17), the time of meal arrival to the caecum was significantly correlated with both orthostatic hypotension (coefficient of contingency, c = 0.53, p < 0.01) and diarrhoea (c = 0.47, p < 0.05), but not with gastric emptying rates. conclusions: patients with type i diabetes mellitus and sympathetic denervation have abnormally rapid transit of a liquid meal through the distal small bowel, which may play a part in diarrhoea production.
rotan perccottus glenii is one of the most widespread alien invasive freshwater fish in eurasia. we reviewed the mechanisms of its dispersion, identified the potential range and regarded these results in the light of possible prevention of further expansion. our analysis was based on 970 presence records and 198 absence records from both invaded and native parts of the range. since 1916 invasion dynamics of rotan have been driven by episodic anthropogenic translocations, followed by spontaneous expansion within river networks, and secondary translocations. maxent species distribution models with independent validations showed that rotan distribution in eurasia has climatic limitations; rotan have already invaded most areas with high climatic suitability in the palearctic, but some regions of north eurasia and north america, where rotan is currently absent, have high climatic suitability and may be vulnerable to invasion in the future. rotan’s high invasiveness, lack of geographical barriers and absence of reliable methods to prevent spread present a very high risk of expansion within appropriate climate limits in europe. our analysis shows that the long-term invasion dynamics of an invasive freshwater species may depend on climate variables rather than on river basin borders. species distribution models, based on large scale environmental layers, can be useful to understand the invasion risk for other freshwater species restricted to shallow aquatic habitats. determining the spread and potential geographical distribution of invasive species is integral to making invasion biology a predictive science. we assembled a dataset of over 1000 occurrences of the argentine ant (linepithema humile), one of the world's worst invasive alien species. native to central south america, argentine ants are now found in many mediterranean and subtropical climates around the world. we used this dataset to assess the species' potential geographical and ecological distribution, and to examine changes in its distributional potential associated with global climate change, using techniques for ecological niche modelling. models developed were highly predictive of the species' overall range, including both the native distributional area and invaded areas worldwide. despite its already widespread occurrence, l. humile has potential for further spread, with tropical coastal africa and southeast asia apparently vulnerable to invasion. projecting ecological niche models onto four general circulation model scenarios of future (2050s) climates provided scenarios of the species' potential for distributional expansion with warming climates: generally, the species was predicted to retract its range in tropical regions, but to expand at higher latitude areas.
the purpose of this work was to investigate the in situ predisposition of lactobacillus pentosus b281 grown in both monoculture and co-culture with the yeast pichia membranifaciens m3a to adhere on the surface of black olives and develop single and mixed microbial communities under different sterile brine conditions. black oxidized olives were submerged in brine solution and inoculated with an initial load of 5.0 log cfu/ml l. pentosus or with a combined culture of 5.0 log cfu/ml l. pentosus and p. membranifaciens. two initial salt concentrations in the brines were investigated, namely 6 % and 10 %, corresponding to low and high salt brine, respectively. brines were supplemented with (1) 0.2 % (v/v) lactic acid, (2) 0.5 % (w/v) glucose, and (3) both 0.2 % (v/v) lactic acid and 0.5 % (w/v) glucose. a brining treatment with no supplementation of glucose and lactic acid was also studied as a control treatment. each brining condition was studied in duplicate at 20 °c for a period of 30 days. the population dynamics of the inoculated strains on the surface of olives were determined by plate count, whereas olive samples were observed at the end of storage under scanning electron microscopy (sem). results showed that, in the case of low salt brines, high population levels between 6.5 and 7.0 log cfu/g were reached on olive drupes for l. pentosus in both single and mixed culture inoculation regardless of brining treatment. however, in high salt brines no cells of the microorganism could be recovered from the control and glucose supplemented brines in the case of single culture inoculation as well as in acidified brines with/without glucose in mixed inoculations. the presence of biofilm on the surface of olives was also confirmed by sem. aggregates of the lactic acid bacteria and the yeast could be observed located mostly in the stomatal apertures and on the epidermis. this work examines the formation of poly-microbial communities adhered to the surface of manzanilla olive fruits processed according to the spanish style. the experimental design consisted of four pilot fermenters inoculated with four lactobacillus pentosus strains, plus another fermenter which was not inoculated and fermented spontaneously. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts were analysed in depth on olive epidermis throughout fermentation by plate count, molecular techniques and scanning electron microscopy. data show that in all cases high population levels (above 8 log(10) cfu per olive) were reached for both groups of microorganisms at the second week of fermentation and that these counts never fell below 6 log(10) cfu per olive during the 3 months that fermenters were monitored. in situ observation of olive epidermis slices revealed a strong aggregation and adhesion between bacteria and yeasts by the formation of a matrix which embedded the microorganisms. geotrichum candidum, pichia galeiformis and candida sorbosa were the main yeast species isolated from these biofilms at the end of fermentation (confirmed by rflp analysis of the 5.8s-its region), while molecular characterization of lactobacilli isolates by means of rapd-pcr with primer opl(5) showed in many cases a high similarity in their banding profiles with the inoculated strains. results obtained in this survey show the importance of studying the olive epidermis throughout fermentation, because ultimately, olives are ingested by consumers.
there is good evidence that forebrain serotonergic systems modulate cognitive flexibility. latent inhibition (li) is a cross-species phenomenon which manifests as poor conditioning to a stimulus that has previously been experienced without consequence and is widely considered an index of the ability to ignore irrelevant stimuli. while much research has focused on dopaminergic mechanisms underlying li, there is also considerable evidence of serotonergic modulation. however, the neuroanatomical locus of these effects remains poorly understood. previous work has identified the nucleus accumbens (nac) as a key component of the neural circuit underpinning li and furthermore, this work has shown that the core and shell subregions of the nac contribute differentially to the expression of li. to examine the role of the serotonergic input to nac in li, we tested animals with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-dht) lesions to the core and shell subregions on li assessed under experimental conditions that produce li in shams and subsequently with weak stimulus pre-exposure designed to prevent the emergence of li in shams. we found that serotonergic deafferentation of the core disrupted li whereas 5,7-dht lesions to the shell produced the opposite effect and potentiated li. the roles of norepinephrine (ne) and serotonin (5-ht) were assessed by comparing the effect of their depletion on the associability of stimuli. ne and 5-ht depleted rats and vehicle controls were assigned to two training conditions and to a control condition. in each of the training conditions rats were pre-exposed to a single stimulus prior to conditioning to a compound stimulus formed from the pre-exposed cue and a new stimulus. the training conditions differed only in the order of testing of each of the stimuli following training. rats assigned to the control condition received only compound conditioning before the associability of each cue was assessed. the findings show that: (a) vehicle rats in the training tasks evidence superconditioning: the associative strength of the new element exceeds that of the pre-exposed cue; (b) equivalent associative strength was found with either cue regardless of their testing order for ne depleted rats; and (c) 5-ht depleted rats did not show superconditioning: the pre-exposed cue competes with the new cue for available associative strength.
zooxanthellate corals are threatened by climate change but may be able to escape increasing temperatures by colonizing higher latitudes. to determine the effect of host range expansion on symbiont genetic diversity, we examined genetic variation among populations of symbiodinium psygmophilum associated with oculina patagonica, a range-expanding coral that acquires its symbionts through horizontal transmission. we optimized five microsatellite primer pairs for s. psygmophilum and tested them on oculina spp. samples from the western north atlantic and the mediterranean. we then used them to compare symbiont genotype diversity between an iberian core and an expansion front population of o. patagonica. only one multilocus s. psygmophilum genotype was identified at the expansion front, and it was shared with the core population, which harbored seven multilocus genotypes. this pattern suggests that o. patagonica range expansion is accompanied by reduced symbiont genetic diversity, possibly due to limited dispersal of symbionts or local selection. a protocol that takes advantage of length heteroplasmy in domain v of chloroplast large subunit (cp23s)–ribosomal dna to identify members of the symbiotic dinoflagellate genus symbiodinium is presented. this protocol is highly specific for symbiodinium, can provide intercladal and intracladal identification of a particular symbiodinium isolate, and can detect multiple symbiodinium chloroplast genotypes simultaneously in the same isolate, making his technique attractive for a variety of research questions. we used this technique to characterize variation among symbiodinium populations associated with a range of phylogenetically diverse and geographically discrete hosts. we also examined symbiont variation within a single host, the caribbean gorgonian pseudopterogorgia elisabethae, from 9 sites in the bahamas, and we report a previously undocumented level of symbiont specificity for particular members of symbiodinium clade b in this gorgonian.
this study investigated the effects of age and inactivity due to being chronically bedridden on atrophy of trunk muscles. the subjects comprised 33 young women (young group) and 41 elderly women who resided in nursing homes or chronic care institutions. the elderly subjects were divided into two groups: independent elderly group who were able to perform activities of daily living involving walking independently (n = 28) and dependent elderly group who were chronically bedridden (n = 13). the thickness of the following six trunk muscles was measured by b-mode ultrasound: the rectus abdominis, external oblique, internal oblique, transversus abdominis, thoracic erector spinae (longissimus) and lumbar multifidus muscles. all muscles except for the transversus abdominis and lumbar multifidus muscles were significantly thinner in the independent elderly group compared with those in the young group. the thicknesses of all muscles in the dependent elderly group was significantly smaller than that in the young group, whereas there were no differences between the dependent elderly and independent elderly groups in the muscle thicknesses of the rectus abdominis and internal oblique muscles. in conclusion, our results suggest that: (1) age-related atrophy compared with young women was less in the deep antigravity trunk muscles than the superficial muscles in the independent elderly women; (2) atrophy associated with chronic bed rest was more marked in the antigravity muscles, such as the back and transversus abdominis. study design within-session intrarater and interrater reliability study.   objective to establish the intrarater and interrater reliability of thickness measurements of the multifidus muscle in a parasagittal plane, conducted by an experienced ultrasound operator and a novice assessor.   background there is considerable evidence for the important role of the multifidus muscle in segmental stabilization of the lumbar spine. the cross-sectional area of the multifidus muscle has been assessed in healthy subjects and patients with low back pain using real-time ultrasound imaging. however, few studies have measured the thickness of the multifidus muscle using a parasagittal view.   methods and measures the thickness of the multifidus muscle was measured at rest, using real-time ultrasound imaging, in 10 subjects without a history of low back pain, at the levels of the l2-3 and l4-5 zygapophyseal joints. the measure was carried out 3 times at each level by 2 assessors (1 experienced, 1 novice). intrarater (model 3) and interrater (model 2) reliability was assessed by calculation of an f statistic (analysis of variance), the intraclass correlation coefficient (icc), and the standard error of measurement (sem).   results on the basis of an average of 3 trials, the 2 operators showed very high interrater agreement on the measurement of thicknesses at the l2-3 level (icc2,3 = 0.96; 95% ci: 0.84 to 0.99) and the l4-5 vertebral level (icc2,3 = 0.97; 95% ci: 0.87 to 0.99), with no systematic differences in muscle size across operators (p > .05). interrater reliability was relatively lower for the l2-3 level (icc2,1 = 0.85; 95% ci: 0.51 to 0.96) than the l4-5 level (icc2,1 = 0.87; 95% ci: 0.52 to 0.97) when a single trial per rater was used, but these values still indicated a high level of agreement. in addition, the novice and experienced operator produced reliable intrarater measurements at l2-3 (icc3,1 = 0.89; 95% ci: 0.72 to 0.97 and 0.94; 95% ci: 0.86 to 0.99) and at l4-5 (icc3,1 = 0.88; 95% ci: 0.68 to 0.97 and 0.95; 95% ci: 0.86 to 0.99), with no systematic differences in muscle size across trials (p > .05). the consistently low sem values also indicate low measurement error.   conclusion a novice and an experienced assessor were both able to reliably perform this measure at rest for 2 vertebral levels using real-time ultrasound imaging. an average of 3 trials produced higher interrater reliability scores, though using a single trial per rater was also reliable.
a hallmark of graft-versus-host-disease (gvhd), a life-threatening complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, is the cytopathic injury of host tissues mediated by persistent alloreactive effector t cells (t(e)). however, the mechanisms that regulate the persistence of alloreactive t(e) during gvhd remain largely unknown. using mouse gvhd models, we demonstrate that alloreactive cd8(+) t(e) rapidly diminished in vivo when adoptively transferred into irradiated secondary congenic recipient mice. in contrast, although alloreactive cd8(+) t(e) underwent massive apoptosis upon chronic exposure to alloantigens, they proliferated in vivo in secondary allogeneic recipients, persisted, and caused severe gvhd. thus, the continuous proliferation of alloreactive cd8(+) t(e), which is mediated by alloantigenic stimuli rather than homeostatic factors, is critical to maintaining their persistence. gene expression profile analysis revealed that although alloreactive cd8(+) t(e) increased the expression of genes associated with cell death, they activated a group of stem cell genes normally expressed in embryonic and neural stem cells. most of these stem cell genes are associated with cell cycle regulation, dna replication, chromatin modification, and transcription. one of these genes, ezh2, which encodes a chromatin modifying enzyme, was abundantly expressed in cd8(+) t(e). silencing ezh2 significantly reduced the proliferation of alloantigen-activated cd8(+) t cells. thus, these findings identify that a group of stem cell genes could play important roles in sustaining terminally differentiated alloreactive cd8(+) t(e) and may be therapeutic targets for controlling gvhd. the supplementary text is a commentary on genes enriched in each stem cell (sc) and on genes enriched in common to all three scs. the supplementary databases (excel files) contain all the genes enriched in each sc (databases s1 to s3), the genes enriched in common in all scs (database s4) and the genes depleted from all scs (database s5). in each excel file the genes have been arranged into separate spreadsheets according to their functional category. the categories are: a. nucleic acid binding b. cell cycle, oncogenes c. cell death d. receptors e. transporters f. chaperones g. ubiquitin, proteasome h. all genes database s4 (genes enriched in common in all scs) contains similar but more detailed functional annotations. all lists can easily be queried by affymetrix probe set number, unigene number, gene name, gene ontology annotation and enrichment using the " find " command. 6. references
sleep spindles, a prominent feature of the non-rapid eye movement (nrem) sleep electroencephalogram (eeg), are linked to cognitive abilities. early childhood is a time of rapid cognitive and neurophysiological maturation; however, little is known about developmental changes in sleep spindles. in this study, we longitudinally examined trajectories of multiple sleep spindle characteristics (i.e., spindle duration, frequency, integrated spindle amplitude, and density) and power in the sigma frequency range (10–16 hz) across ages 2, 3, and 5 years (n = 8; 3 males). at each time point, nocturnal sleep eeg was recorded in-home after 13-h of prior wakefulness. spindle duration, integrated spindle amplitude, and sigma power increased with age across all eeg derivations (c3a2, c4a1, o2a1, and o1a2; all ps < 0.05). we also found a developmental decrease in mean spindle frequency (p < 0.05) but no change in spindle density with increasing age. thus, sleep spindles increased in duration and amplitude but decreased in frequency across early childhood. our data characterize early developmental changes in sleep spindles, which may advance understanding of thalamocortical brain connectivity and associated lifelong disease processes. these findings also provide unique insights into spindle ontogenesis in early childhood and may help identify electrophysiological features related to healthy and aberrant brain maturation. during the first international eeg congress, london in 1947, it was recommended that dr. herbert h. jasper study methods to standardize the placement of electrodes used in eeg (jasper 1958). a report with recommendations was to be presented to the second international congress in paris in 1949. the electrode placement systems in use at various centers were found to be similar, with only minor differences, although their designations, letters and numbers were entirely different. dr. jasper established some guidelines which would be established in recommending a speci®c system to the federation and these are listed below.
this study compares four models for predicting the potential distribution of non-indigenous weed species in the conterminous u.s. the comparison focused on evaluating modeling tools and protocols as currently used for weed risk assessment or for predicting the potential distribution of invasive weeds. we used six weed species (three highly invasive and three less invasive non-indigenous species) that have been established in the u.s. for more than 75 years. the experiment involved providing non-u. s. location data to users familiar with one of the four evaluated techniques, who then developed predictive models that were applied to the united states without knowing the identity of the species or its u.s. distribution. we compared a simple gis climate matching technique known as proto3, a simple climate matching tool climex match climates, the correlative model maxent, and a process model known as the thornley transport resistance (ttr) model. two experienced users ran each modeling tool except ttr, which had one user. models were trained with global species distribution data excluding any u.s. data, and then were evaluated using the current known u.s. distribution. the influence of weed species identity and modeling tool on prevalence and sensitivity effects was compared using a generalized linear mixed model. each modeling tool itself had a low statistical significance, while weed species alone accounted for 69.1 and 48.5% of the variance for prevalence and sensitivity, respectively. these results suggest that simple modeling tools might perform as well as complex ones in the case of predicting potential distribution for a weed not yet present in the united states. considerations of model accuracy should also be balanced with those of reproducibility and ease of use. more important than the choice of modeling tool is the construction of robust protocols and testing both new and experienced users under blind test conditions that approximate operational conditions. the ncep climate forecast system reanalysis (cfsr) was completed for the 31-yr period from 1979 to 2009, in january 2010. the cfsr was designed and executed as a global, high-resolution coupled atmosphere–ocean–land surface–sea ice system to provide the best estimate of the state of these coupled domains over this period. the current cfsr will be extended as an operational, real-time product into the future. new features of the cfsr include 1) coupling of the atmosphere and ocean during the generation of the 6-h guess field, 2) an interactive sea ice model, and 3) assimilation of satellite radiances by the gridpoint statistical interpolation (gsi) scheme over the entire period. the cfsr global atmosphere resolution is ~38 km (t382) with 64 levels extending from the surface to 0.26 hpa. the global ocean's latitudinal spacing is 0.25° at the equator, extending to a global 0.5° beyond the tropics, with 40 levels to a depth of 4737 m. the global land surface model has four soil levels and the global sea ice m...
annotation data is stored and manipulated in various formats and there have been a number of efforts to build generalised models of annotation to support sharing of data between tools. this work has shown that it is possible to store annotations from many different tools in a single canonical format and allow transformation into other formats as needed. however, moving data between formats is often a matter of importing or exporting from one tool to another. this paper describes a web-based interface to annotation data that makes use of an abstract model of annotation in its internal store but is able to deliver a variety of annotation formats to clients over the web. rdf, the core data format for the semantic web, is increasingly being deployed both from automated sources and via human authoring either directly or through tools that generate rdf output. as individuals build up large amounts of rdf data and as groups begin to collaborate on authoring knowledge stores in rdf, the need for some kind of version management becomes apparent. while there are many version control systems available for program source code and even for xml data, the use of version control for rdf data is not a widely explored area. this paper examines an existing version control system for program source code, darcs, which is grounded in a semi-formal theory of patches, and proposes an adaptation to directly manage versions of an rdf triple store.
twenty genes encoding enterotoxin and enterotoxin-like proteins have been described in staphylococcus aureus strains. five of these occur commonly in the enterotoxin gene cluster (egc: selo, selm, sei, seln and seg). in the sei-seln intergenic region, two pseudogenes, psient1 and psient2, can be present or an additional gene designated selu or a variant selu(v). whilst frequencies of loci bearing pseudogenes (egc1) or the selu gene (egc2) have been reported, the distinction between selu-bearing and selu(v)-bearing (egc3) loci has rarely been made. a pcr-rflp procedure involving cleavage of the sei-seln intergenic region by restriction endonuclease bbvi or tsei was developed that allowed differentiation of selu(+) and selu(v)(+) loci. in addition, pcr primers were designed to yield a 203 bp amplimer for sequencing of a selu or selu(v) intragenic region, which encompassed ten signature nucleotide differences. a total of 43 egc(+) human nasal isolates and 53 egc(+) bovine, ovine, caprine, leporine and gallinaceous isolates were egc typed and agr typed. none of the animal isolates was of agr type iii. a total of 12 out of 17 egc3(+) human nasal isolates were of agr type iii, the other 5 being agr type i. on the basis of representative multilocus sequence typing, agr type iii/egc3(+) strains belonged to cc30. human nasal isolates bearing an egc1 locus were distributed evenly across agr types i, ii and iii. only two nasal isolates had an egc2 locus. all 14 agr type iv isolates, only 1 of which was of human origin, possessed an egc2 locus. the agr iv nasal isolate was fusidic acid sensitive and was found to be st123 (cc121). there were strong associations between bovine, leporine and gallinaceous s. aureus clonal types and egc locus types. the pcr-rflp procedure was used to screen an additional 45 s. aureus isolates from dogs, cats, rats, pigs and horses for egc locus types. of these, 33 were egc(-). six equine isolates were selu(+). one canine and three porcine isolates possessed pseudogenes psient1 and psient2. one porcine and one canine isolate each had the selu(v) gene. putative relationships between disease-causing propensity and egc type need (re-)evaluation. staphylococcus aureus isolates from cows in ireland (n = 102) and the usa (n = 42) were characterized by rapd‐pcr and analysed for the production of a number of putative virulence factors. of these strains 63 representative isolates were screened for the corresponding virulence factor genes by pcr or southern hybridization or both. the isolates were divided into 12 distinct clonal types on the basis of their rapd fingerprint profiles. of the isolates, 107 (74·3%) tested positive for clumping factor in a slide agglutination test, all 24 rapd type 7 isolates being negative for clumping factor. pcr analysis of region r, a repeat region of the clfa gene, revealed eight region‐r sizes. there was a strong association between rapd type and the clfa region‐r genotype among irish isolates. of the rapd type 7 isolates, 21 (87·5%) coproduced toxic shock syndrome toxin‐1 (tsst‐1) and staphylococcal enterotoxin c (sec). over 90% of isolates demonstrated haemolytic activity on sheep or rabbit red blood cells and all isolates harboured the gamma‐haemolysin (hlg) locus. of the irish isolates, all those of rapd type 7 were sensitive to penicillin g, whereas 86% of rapd types 4 and 5 strains were resistant. furthermore, rapd types 5 and 7 were more likely to be associated with clinical mastitis whereas rapd type 4 isolates were more often associated with a latent infection. the current study identifies some of the putative virulence factors produced by the predominant clonal types of bovine staph. aureus that may be considered as components of a vaccine.
performance of rate-0.8 4-ary ldpc coded modulation with map detector is demonstrated in 40gb/s dual-polarization qpsk transmissions. we achieve >10 db coding gain at ber of 10−6 and show no countable errors after 10,560 km transmission over legacy dmfs. we propose a maximum a posteriori probability (map) turbo equalizer based on the sliding-window multilevel bahl-cocke-jelinek-raviv algorithm. this scheme is suitable for simultaneous nonlinear and linear impairment mitigation in multilevel coded-modulation schemes with coherent detection. the proposed scheme employs large-girth quasicyclic ldpc codes as channel codes. we demonstrate the efficiency of this method in dealing with fiber nonlinearities by performing monte carlo simulations. in addition, we provide the experimental results that demonstrate the efficiency of this method in dealing with polarization mode dispersion. we also study the ultimate channel capacity limits, assuming an independent identically distributed source.
this study investigated the relationship between psychotherapeutic interventions and pharmacologic measures of pharmacotherapy treatment adherence in patients with bipolar i disorder, as well as the relationship between these measures and treatment outcome. subjects were participating in an ongoing maintenance treatment study. audiotaped therapy sessions were rated for frequency of psychotherapeutic interventions related to pharmacotherapy treatment adherence. pharmacologic measures of medication adherence were compared to the tape ratings as well as to treatment outcome. variability in log erythrocyte (rbc) lithium—a marker of probable nonadherence to the pharmacotherapy regimen—for individual patients correlated significantly with treatment adherence interventions scale ratings. this marker of nonadherence was significantly related to maintenance treatment outcome, as was variability of the serum lithium level/dose (l/d) ratio; however, no relationship was found between treatment adherence interventions scale ratings and outcome. background the effectiveness of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (maois) in tricyclic resistant depression has received surprisingly little systematic study.   method patients who failed to respond to sustained, adequate treatment with the tricyclic imipramine (mean maximum dosage = 260 mg/day) and interpersonal psychotherapy were withdrawn from imipramine and treated in a standardized, but open-label 6-week trial with either phenelzine (n = 4; 60 mg/day) or tranylcypromine (n = 36; mean = 38.5 mg/day) and continued interpersonal psychotherapy.   results forty of 42 patients (95%) completed the trial, of whom 23 (58%) responded to treatment. highly significant improvement was documented on measures of depression, reversed neurovegetative symptoms, and somatic symptoms. response was significantly correlated with severity of depression (pre-maoi score on the hamilton rating scale for depression), severity of a composite score of anergic and reversed neurovegetative features, and low levels of improvement during initial imipramine/interpersonal psychotherapy. of patients who met criteria for proposed subforms of anergic or atypical depression, 67% (18/27) responded (p less than .05); 77% (17/22) of patients who scored above the mean on the composite measure of anergic and reversed neurovegetative features responded (p less than .01).   conclusion these findings provide strong evidence of the utility of maois in tricyclic-resistant depression, especially in patients with features such as fatigue, volitional inhibition, motoric retardation, hypersomnia, and/or weight gain.
in this paper we present the results of a project, named asit, which provides linguists with a crucial test bed for formal hypotheses concerning human language. in particular, asit aims to capture cross-linguistic variants of grammatical structures within a sample of about 200 italian dialects. since dialects are rarely recognized as official languages, first of all linguists need a dedicated digital library system providing the tools for the unambiguous identification of each dialect on the basis of geographical, administrative and geo-linguistic parameters. secondly, the information access component of the digital library system needs to be designed to allow users to search the occurrences of a specific grammatical structure (e.g. a relative clause or a particular word order) rather than a specific word. thirdly, since asit has been specifically geared to the needs of linguists, user-friendly graphical interfaces need to be created to give easy access to and make the building of the language resource easier and distributed. the paper reports on the ways these three main aims have been achieved. this paper examines the current way of keeping the data produced during the evaluation campaigns and highlights some shortenings of it. as a consequence, we propose a new approach for improving the management evaluation campaigns' data. in this approach, the data are considered as scientific data to be cured and enriched in order to give full support to longitudinal statistical studies and long-term preservation.
diversified query expansion (dqe) based approaches aim to select a set of expansion terms with less redundancy among them while covering as many query aspects as possible. recently they have experimentally demonstrate their effectiveness for the task of search result diversification. one challenge faced by existing dqe approaches is to ensure the aspect coverage. in this paper, we propose a novel method for dqe, called compact aspect embedding, which exploits trace norm regularization to learn a low rank vector space for the query, with each eigenvector of the learnt vector space representing an aspect, and the absolute value of its corresponding eigenvalue representing the association strength of that aspect to the query. meanwhile, each expansion term is mapped into the vector space as well. based on this novel representation of the query aspects and expansion terms, we design a greedy selection strategy to choose a set of expansion terms to explicitly cover all possible aspects of the query. we test our method on several trec diversification data sets, and show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art search result diversification approaches. diversified query expansion aims to cover different possible intents of a short and ambiguous query. most standard approaches use a single source of information, e.g., the initial retrieval list or some external resource like conceptnet. the coverage is thus limited by that of the resource. to alleviate this issue, we propose the use of multiple resources. more specifically, our framework first automatically generates a list of diversified queries for each resource, and then combines the retrieved documents for all the expanded queries following the maximal marginal relevance principal. we evaluate our framework on several trec data sets, and demonstrate that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, suggesting the effectiveness of incorporating different resources for diversified query expansion.
summaryin connection with studies on vitamin a transport to keratinocytes in vivo, the retinol, retinolbinding protein (rbp), and prealbumin contents of blister fluid obtained subepidermally (suction) or intraepidermally (friction) were analyzed. the median concentrations of the three components in suction blister fluid (sbf) were all about 33% of the serum concentrations. corresponding values for α2-macroglobulin and total protein, measured as controls, were 27 and 30% respectively. the relative amounts of retinol and prealbumin in friction blister fluid (fbf) were the same as those in sbf. by contrast, fbf contained more rbp (median value 40%; p<0.01 vs sbf value). it is suggested that apo-rbp (rbp without retinol) is generated within the epidermis and contributes to the high rbp value in fbf. fbf constituents are probably derived from the intercellular space of the epidermis, at least during the initial phase of blister formation. accordingly, rbp and prealbumin were identified in homogenates of pure epidermis. during the later stages of blister formation, fbf resembles an ultrafiltrate of dermal fluid, although different in this respect from sbf. in fetal life the development of bullous pemphigoid antigen is preceded by a morphologically detectable basement membrane zone (bmz). the present study investigated the possibility that similar morphologic and antigenic changes of the bmz occur in short term organ culture of human skin. twenty small pieces from each of four neonatal foreskin specimens were cultured under standard conditions. at regular intervals two pieces from each specimen were removed. one piece was frozen and cryostat sections were processed for indirect immunofluorescence using a patient's serum that was proven to have circulating pemphigoid igg antibodies. additional sections were stained with periodic acid-schiff and hematoxylin and eosin. the other piece was processed for electron microscopic examination. morphologically the bmz started degenerating after 24 hours. regeneration started on the 4th day and reached an optimal level on the 5th day. chance of the immunofluorescence line at the bmz began with a slight weakening at 24 hours followed by progressive widening and breakage until the 4th day when fluorescence was no longer detectable. except for a few punctate areas immunofluorescence remained absent on the 5th day. sixth day specimens, however, revealed reappearance of the immunofluorescence line in a continuous pattern. by the 7th day a second morphologic and antigenic degeneration started at the bmz. this lag between the morphologic and antigenic regeneration of the bmz in organ culture although shorter is comparable to the one observed during the development of the bmz in fetal life.
seam carving, as a content-aware image resizing algorithm, is widely used nowadays. in this paper, an advanced hybrid feature model is presented to reveal the trace of seam carving, especially seam carving at a low carving rate, applied to uncompressed digital images. two groups of features are designed to capture energy variation and pixel variation caused by seam carving, respectively. as indicated by the experimental works, the state-of-the-art performance on detecting 5% and 10% carving rate cases has been improved from 81.13% and 90.26% to 85.75% and 94.87%, respectively. presents a theoretically very simple, yet efficient, multiresolution approach to gray-scale and rotation invariant texture classification based on local binary patterns and nonparametric discrimination of sample and prototype distributions. the method is based on recognizing that certain local binary patterns, termed "uniform," are fundamental properties of local image texture and their occurrence histogram is proven to be a very powerful texture feature. we derive a generalized gray-scale and rotation invariant operator presentation that allows for detecting the "uniform" patterns for any quantization of the angular space and for any spatial resolution and presents a method for combining multiple operators for multiresolution analysis. the proposed approach is very robust in terms of gray-scale variations since the operator is, by definition, invariant against any monotonic transformation of the gray scale. another advantage is computational simplicity as the operator can be realized with a few operations in a small neighborhood and a lookup table. experimental results demonstrate that good discrimination can be achieved with the occurrence statistics of simple rotation invariant local binary patterns.
background infants account for a small proportion of the overall dengue case burden in endemic countries but can be clinically more difficult to manage. the clinical and laboratory features in infants with dengue have not been extensively characterised. methodology/principal findings this prospective, cross-sectional descriptive study of infants hospitalized with dengue was conducted in vietnam from november 2004 to december 2007. more than two-thirds of 303 infants enrolled on clinical suspicion of dengue had a serologically confirmed dengue virus (denv) infection. almost all were primary dengue infections and 80% of the infants developed dhf/dss. at the time of presentation and during hospitalization, the clinical signs and symptoms in infants with dengue were difficult to distinguish from those with other febrile illnesses, suggesting that in infants early laboratory confirmation could assist appropriate management. detection of plasma ns1 antigen was found to be a sensitive marker of acute dengue in infants with primary infection, especially in the first few days of illness. conclusions/significance collectively, these results provide a systematic description of the clinical features of dengue in infants and highlight the value of ns1 detection for diagnosis. the pathogenesis of dengue in infants is poorly understood. we postulated that dengue severity in infants would be positively associated with markers of viral burden and that maternally derived, neutralizing anti-dengue antibody would have decayed before the age at which infants with dengue presented to the hospital. in 75 vietnamese infants with primary dengue, we found significant heterogeneity in viremia and ns1 antigenemia at hospital presentation, and these factors were independent of disease grade or continuous measures of disease severity. neutralizing antibody titers, predicted in each infant at the time of their illness, suggested that the majority of infants (65%) experienced dengue hemorrhagic fever when the maternally derived neutralizing antibody titer had declined to <1 : 20. collectively, these data have important implications for dengue vaccine research because they suggest that viral burden may not solely explain severe dengue in infants and that neutralizing antibody is a reasonable but not absolute marker of protective immunity in infants.
iterative methods that take steps in approximate subgradient directions have proved to be useful for stochastic learning problems over large or streaming data sets. when the objective consists of a loss function plus a nonsmooth regularization term, whose purpose is to induce structure (for example, sparsity) in the solution, the solution often lies on a low-dimensional manifold along which the regularizer is smooth. this paper shows that a regularized dual averaging algorithm can identify this manifold with high probability. this observation motivates an algorithmic strategy in which, once a near-optimal manifold is identified, we switch to an algorithm that searches only in this manifold, which typically has much lower intrinsic dimension than the full space, thus converging quickly to a near-optimal point with the desired structure. computational results are presented to illustrate these claims. convex programming involves a convex set f ⊆ rn and a convex cost function c : f → r. the goal of convex programming is to find a point in f which minimizes c. in online convex programming, the convex set is known in advance, but in each step of some repeated optimization problem, one must select a point in f before seeing the cost function for that step. this can be used to model factory production, farm production, and many other industrial optimization problems where one is unaware of the value of the items produced until they have already been constructed. we introduce an algorithm for this domain. we also apply this algorithm to repeated games, and show that it is really a generalization of infinitesimal gradient ascent, and the results here imply that generalized infinitesimal gradient ascent (giga) is universally consistent.
abstract normal function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is dependent on gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gnrh)-stimulated synthesis and secretion of luteinizing hormone (lh) from the pituitary gonadotroph. while the transcriptional coactivator creb binding protein (cbp) is known to interact with egr-1, the major mediator of gnrh action on the lhb gene, the role of cbp in lhb gene expression has yet to be characterized. we show that in the lβt2 gonadotroph cell line, overexpression of cbp augmented the response to gnrh and that knockdown of cbp eliminated gnrh responsiveness. while gnrh-mediated phosphorylation of cbp at ser436 increased the interaction with egr-1 on the lhb promoter, loss of this phosphorylation site eliminated gnrh-mediated lhb expression in lβt2 cells. in vivo, loss of cbp phosphorylation at ser436 rendered female mice subfertile. s436a knock-in mice had disrupted estrous cyclicity and reduced responsiveness to gnrh. our results show that gnrh-mediated phosphorylation of cbp at ser436 is required for egr-1 to activate lhb expression and is a requirement for normal fertility in female mice. as cbp can be phosphorylated by other factors, such as insulin, our studies suggest that cbp may act as a key regulator of lhb expression in the gonadotroph by integrating homeostatic information with gnrh signaling. hepatic gluconeogenesis is essential for maintenance of normal blood glucose concentrations and is regulated by opposing stimulatory (cyclic adenosine monophosphate, camp) and inhibitory (insulin) signaling pathways. the camp signaling pathway leads to phosphorylation of camp response element–binding (creb) protein, resulting in recruitment of the coactivators creb-binding protein (cbp) and p300 and subsequent activation of gluconeogenesis. insulin signaling leads to phosphorylation of cbp at serine 436, a residue near its creb-interacting domain, but it is unknown whether this event modulates camp signaling. here, we show in vitro and in 'knock-in' mice that a mutant cbp (s436a) is aberrantly recruited to creb protein, resulting in inappropriate activation of gluconeogenesis in the fed state and glucose intolerance resulting from increased hepatic glucose production. we propose that insulin signaling may directly regulate many camp signaling pathways at the transcriptional level by controlling cbp recruitment.
past studies indicate that men generally report having had more sexual experience and sexual partners than women, as well as an earlier age at first intercourse. at least some of these findings may partially reflect different responses to certain contextual variables in research. college students (266 men and 463 women) were asked to anonymously report their sexual attitudes and behavior after reading one of three fictitious statements about research findings regarding gender differences in sexuality. some past findings were replicated, with men reporting somewhat more sexual experience and more permissive sexual attitudes than women. however, women reported a significantly younger age at first intercourse than did men. while there was no significant sex difference for total number of sexual partners, there was a significant interaction. with female research assistants (but not with male assistants), men reported more sexual partners when they were told that women are now more sexually permissive than men. this finding appeared to be largely a function of the men who scored higher on measures of hypermasculinity and ambivalent sexism. women's reports were not significantly affected by the wording of the cover sheet, regardless of the sex of the research assistant. even in this anonymous survey, the sex of the experimenter and the nature of the statement about research findings had an impact on the sex differences that were found. in light of these results, some previous conclusions about male-female differences in sexual behavior may need to be examined more closely. individual differences in willingness to engage in uncommitted sexual relations were investigated in 6 studies. in study 1, a 5-item sociosexual orientation inventory (soi) was developed. studies 2, 3, and 4 provided convergent validity evidence for the soi, revealing that persons who have an unrestricted sociosexual orientation tend to (a) engage in sex at an earlier point in their relationships, (b) engage in sex with more than 1 partner at a time, and (c) be involved in relationships characterized by less investment, commitment, love, and dependency. study 5 provided discriminant validity for the soi, revealing that it does not covary appreciably with a good marker of sex drive. study 6 demonstrated that the soi correlates negligibly with measures of sexual satisfaction, anxiety, and guilt. the possible stability of, origins of, and motivational bases underlying individual differences in sociosexuality are discussed.
approximately 20% of stage 4 high-risk neuroblastoma patients are alive and disease-free 5 years after disease onset while the remaining experience rapid and fatal progression. numerous findings underline the prognostic role of methylation of defined target genes in neuroblastoma without taking into account the clinical and biological heterogeneity of this disease. in this report we have investigated the methylation of the pcdhb cluster, the most informative member of the “methylator phenotype” in neuroblastoma, hypothesizing that if this epigenetic mark can predict overall and progression free survival in high-risk stage 4 neuroblastoma, it could be utilized to improve the risk stratification of the patients, alone or in conjunction with the previously identified methylation of the sfn gene (14.3.3sigma) that can accurately predict outcome in these patients. we have utilized univariate and multivariate models to compare the prognostic power of pcdhb methylation in terms of overall and progression free survival, quantitatively determined by pyrosequencing, with that of other markers utilized for the patients' stratification utilizing methylation thresholds calculated on neuroblastoma at stage 1–4 and only on stage 4, high-risk patients. our results indicate that pcdhb accurately distinguishes between high- and intermediate/low risk stage 4 neuroblastoma in agreement with the established risk stratification criteria. however pcdhb cannot predict outcome in the subgroup of stage 4 patients at high-risk whereas methylation levels of sfn are suggestive of a “methylation gradient” associated with tumor aggressiveness as suggested by the finding of a higher threshold that defines a subset of patients with an extremely severe disease (os <24 months). because of the heterogeneity of neuroblastoma we believe that clinically relevant methylation markers should be selected and tested on homogeneous groups of patients rather than on patients at all stages. purpose because current approaches to risk classification and treatment stratification for children with neuroblastoma (nb) vary greatly throughout the world, it is difficult to directly compare risk-based clinical trials. the international neuroblastoma risk group (inrg) classification system was developed to establish a consensus approach for pretreatment risk stratification.   patients and methods the statistical and clinical significance of 13 potential prognostic factors were analyzed in a cohort of 8,800 children diagnosed with nb between 1990 and 2002 from north america and australia (children's oncology group), europe (international society of pediatric oncology europe neuroblastoma group and german pediatric oncology and hematology group), and japan. survival tree regression analyses using event-free survival (efs) as the primary end point were performed to test the prognostic significance of the 13 factors.   results stage, age, histologic category, grade of tumor differentiation, the status of the mycn oncogene, chromosome 11q status, and dna ploidy were the most highly statistically significant and clinically relevant factors. a new staging system (inrg staging system) based on clinical criteria and tumor imaging was developed for the inrg classification system. the optimal age cutoff was determined to be between 15 and 19 months, and 18 months was selected for the classification system. sixteen pretreatment groups were defined on the basis of clinical criteria and statistically significantly different efs of the cohort stratified by the inrg criteria. patients with 5-year efs more than 85%, more than 75% to < or = 85%, > or = 50% to < or = 75%, or less than 50% were classified as very low risk, low risk, intermediate risk, or high risk, respectively.   conclusion by defining homogenous pretreatment patient cohorts, the inrg classification system will greatly facilitate the comparison of risk-based clinical trials conducted in different regions of the world and the development of international collaborative studies.
background: fetal malnutrition has been associated with an increased risk of neonatal morbidities and mortalities and its proper documentation in a newborn is essential for optimal management of the child.objective: to determine the nutritional status of preterm newborns at birth using canscore and anthropometry and to compare the relative efficiency of canscore and the anthropometric indices in detecting fm.methods:the study was carried out on consecutive, singleton, live born babies of ≥28 completed weeks through 36 weeks gestation born at lagos university teaching hospital, lagos, nigeria without any major congenital abnormalities or severe perinatal illness. each infant was examined by the investigator within 48 hours of birth. birth weights and lengths were recorded for each infant at birth. using the oloweintrauterine growth chart, birth weights for gestational age below the 3rd percentile and above the 97th percentile on the chart were taken as small for gestational age and large for gestational age respectively. pi was computed from the formula: pi = weight (g) / length3 (cm) x100. a pi 0.05). both canscore and pi detected significantly large numbers of fm in the study sample compared with birth weight. all the anthropometric parameters showed low sensitivity in detection of fm (which is the visible wasting or loss of subcutaneous tissues and muscles) but they all had high specificity.conclusion:fm is still prevalent in our environment even in preterm babies. canscore identified moremalnourished subjects than anthropometry. fetal malnutrition is a common and potentially serious problem perinatally and for later growth and development. unless sought in the neonate, fetal malnutrition is frequently missed but can be detected readily by a simple clinical examination.

sexual risk behavior and illicit drug use among people living with hiv/aids (plwha) contribute to poor health and onward transmission of hiv. the aim of this collaborative multi-site nursing research study was to explore the association between self-compassion and risk behaviors in plwha. as part of a larger project, nurse researchers in canada, china, namibia, puerto rico, thailand and the us enrolled 1211 sexually active plwha using convenience sampling. the majority of the sample was male, middle-aged, and from the us. illicit drug use was strongly associated with sexual risk behavior, but participants with higher self-compassion were less likely to report sexual risk behavior, even in the presence of illicit drug use. self-compassion may be a novel area for behavioral intervention development for plwha. purpose human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) treatment self-efficacy is the confidence held by an individual in her or his ability to follow treatment recommendations, including specific hiv care such as initiating and adhering to antiretroviral therapy (art). the purpose of this study was to explore the potential mediating role of treatment adherence self-efficacy in the relationships between social cognitive theory constructs and self- reported art adherence.   design cross-sectional and descriptive. the study was conducted between 2009 and 2011 and included 1,414 participants who lived in the united states or puerto rico and were taking antiretroviral medications.   methods social cognitive constructs were tested specifically: behaviors (three adherence measures each consisting of one item about adherence at 3-day and 30-day along with the adherence rating scale), cognitive or personal factors (the center for epidemiology studies depression scale to assess for depressive symptoms, the 12-item short form health survey (sf-12) to assess physical functioning, one item about physical condition, one item about comorbidity), environmental influences (the social capital scale, one item about social support), and treatment self-efficacy (hiv adherence self-efficacy scale). analysis included descriptive statistics and regression.   results the average participant was 47 years old, male, and a racial or ethnic minority, had an education of high school or less, had barely adequate or totally inadequate income, did not work, had health insurance, and was living with hiv/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome for 15 years. the model provided support for adherence self-efficacy as a robust predictor of art adherence behavior, serving a partial mediating role between environmental influences and cognitive or personal factors.   conclusions although other factors such as depressive symptoms and lack of social capital impact adherence to art, nurses can focus on increasing treatment self-efficacy through diverse interactional strategies using principles of adult learning and strategies to improve health literacy.   clinical relevance adherence to art reduces the viral load thereby decreasing morbidity and mortality and risk of transmission to uninfected persons. nurses need to use a variety of strategies to increase treatment self-efficacy.
abnormalities in fronto-limbic-striatal white matter (wm) have been reported in bipolar disorder (bd), but results have been inconsistent across studies. furthermore, there have been no detailed investigations as to whether acute mood states contribute to microstructural changes in wm tracts. in order to compare fiber density and structural integrity within wm tracts between bd depression and remission, whole-brain fractional anisotropy (fa) and mean diffusivity (md) were assessed in 37 bipolar i disorder (bd-i) patients (16 depressed and 21 remitted), and 26 healthy individuals with diffusion tensor imaging. significantly decreased fa and increased md in bilateral prefronto-limbic-striatal white matter and right inferior fronto-occipital, superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi were shown in all bd-i patients versus controls, as well as in depressed bd-i patients compared to both controls and remitted bd-i patients. depressed bd-i patients also exhibited increased fa in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. remitted bd-i patients did not differ from controls in fa or md. these findings suggest that bd-i depression may be associated with acute microstructural wm changes. most patients treated for an episode of unipolar or bipolar major depression are treatment resistant in the sense that the majority do not achieve full remission with the first somatic or psychosocial treatment they receive. little attention has been given to formalizing criteria for evaluating the nature and extent of treatment resistance, even though determining the adequacy and outcome of prior treatment trials is key in clinical decision making about subsequent treatment. furthermore, determining the adequacy of prior treatment is essential since substantial evidence indicates that large numbers of depressed patients are undertreated, resulting in prolonged episodes and the appearance of "pseudoresistance." adequacy of antidepressant treatment trials should be defined in terms of thresholds for the dosage and duration of medication, adherence, and clinical outcome. the antidepressant treatment history form is presented as one method to formalize the evaluation of treatment adequacy and treatment resistance.
after treatment for breast cancer, many women experience cognitive problems, as determined by objective neuropsychological tests. however, the ecological validity of these tests has been questioned. this study explored the trajectory of perceived attentional function from before to 24 months after surgery in women with breast cancer and examined the effect of adjuvant treatment on this perceived attentional function. women with breast cancer (n = 200) were assessed for perceived cognitive function by measuring attentional function using the attentional function index (afi). covariates included anxiety, depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. perceived attentional function declined in 54% of women at 1 month after surgery. at 1 and 2 years after surgery, 41 and 30% of women, respectively, still perceived this decline. the mean afi decreased to the lowest point 1 month after surgery, but improved gradually afterward, taking about 1 year to return to the pre-surgery level. decreases in perceived attentional function were associated with increases in anxiety, depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. after controlling for baseline differences and covariates, mean afi scores were not associated with adjuvant treatment. perceived cognitive function deteriorated after surgery but improved over time. it was not associated with adjuvant cancer treatment. the primary purpose of this preliminary research was to describe the psychometric properties of a newly‐developed everyday spatial questionnaire for dementia‐patient version (esqd‐p) in a chinese population. a secondary goal was to assess the relationship between executive functions and wayfinding strategy application. the esqd‐p is a measure for the phenomenon of ‘getting lost behavior’ (glb) reported by early alzheimer's disease sufferers, based on the concept of spatial problem‐solving.
stroke is a major cause of dysphagia. few studies to date have reported on standardized multidisciplinary protocolized approaches to the management of post-stroke dysphagia. the aim of this retrospective cohort study was to evaluate the impact of a standardized multidisciplinary protocol on clinical outcomes in patients with post-stroke dysphagia. we performed retrospective chart reviews of patients with post-stroke dysphagia admitted to the neurological ward of verona university hospital from 2004 to 2008. outcomes after usual treatment for dysphagia (t− group) were compared versus outcomes after treatment under a standardized diagnostic and rehabilitative multidisciplinary protocol (t+ group). outcome measures were death, pneumonia on x-ray, need for respiratory support, and proportion of patients on tube feeding at discharge. of the 378 patients admitted with stroke, 84 had dysphagia and were enrolled in the study. a significantly lower risk of in-hospital death (odds ratio [or] 0.20 [0.53–0.78]), pneumonia (or 0.33 [0.10–1.03]), need for respiratory support (or 0.48 [0.14–1.66]), and tube feeding at discharge (or 0.30 [0.09–0.91]) was recorded for the t+ group (n = 39) as compared to the t− group (n = 45). the adjusted or showed no difference between the two groups for in-hospital death and tube feeding at discharge. use of a standardized multidisciplinary protocolized approach to the management of post-stroke dysphagia may significantly reduce rates of aspiration pneumonia, in-hospital mortality, and tube feeding in dysphagic stroke survivors. consistent with the study’s exploratory purposes, our findings suggest that the multidisciplinary protocol applied in this study offers an effective model of management of post-stroke dysphagia. abstractaspiration is an important variable related to increased morbidity, mortality, and cost of care for acute stroke patients. this prospective systematic replication study compared a clinical swallowing examination consisting of six clinical identifiers of aspiration risk, i.e., dysphonia, dysarthria, abnormal gag reflex, abnormal volitional cough, cough after swallow, and voice change after swallow, with an instrumental fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (fees) to determine reliability in identifying aspiration risk following acute stroke. a referred consecutive sample of 49 first-time stroke patients was evaluated within 24 hours poststroke, first with the clinical examination followed immediately by fees. the endoscopist was blinded to results of clinical testing. the clinical examination correctly identified 19 subjects with aspiration risk, when compared with the criterion standard fees, but incorrectly identified 3 patients as having no aspiration risk when they did. the clinical examination incorrectly identified 19 subjects with aspiration risk but determined correctly no aspiration risk in 8 patients who did not exhibit aspiration risk on fees. clinical examination sensitivity = 86%; specificity = 30%; false negative rate = 14%; false positive rate = 70%; positive predictive value = 50%; and negative predictive value = 73%. it was concluded that the clinical examination, when compared with fees, underestimated aspiration risk in patients with aspiration risk and overestimated aspiration risk in patients who did not exhibit aspiration risk. careful consideration of the limitations of clinical testing leads us to believe that a reliable, timely, and cost-effective instrumental swallow evaluation should be available for the majority of patients following acute stroke.
within europe, ireland has one of the highest reported infection rates with the diarrhoeal protozoan pathogen cryptosporidium. in this study 249 cryptosporidium parvum isolates collected from irish patients between 2000 and 2009 were subtyped by sequence analysis of the gp60 locus. a subsample of 127 isolates was also typed at the ms1 and ml1 loci. gp60 subtype iiaa18g3r1 was the predominant subtype in every year and every season throughout the country. over the 10-year period there was no evidence that host immunity to the predominant subtype caused a shift in its prevalence. length frequency distributions of the gp60 tca/tcg repeats compiled from published data, showed distinct patterns for countries with predominantly zoonotic or anthroponotic transmission cycles, respectively. although considered to be mostly affected by zoonotic cryptosporidiosis, the gp60 fragment length of irish c. parvum isolates mirrored that of countries with predominantly human-to-human transmission, indicating more complex routes of infection between livestock and humans. due to their homogeneity, ml1 and ms1 were not considered useful loci for subtyping c. parvum strains in ireland. cryptosporidium parvum dna from 175 neonatal calves on 16 farms in eight eastern states in the united states was subtyped by sequence analysis of the 60-kda glycoprotein gene to determinate the parasite genetic diversity. six subtypes of the iia subtype family were found. subtype iiaa15g2r1, which is the predominant c. parvum subtype in calves in many parts of the world, was identified in 77% of the c. parvum dna from calves. several farms had more than one c. parvum subtype and a few calves had infections with mixed subtypes. distribution of subtypes differed geographically. diversity of c. parvum in calves in eastern united states was lower than that previously seen in michigan and southern ontario. the high prevalence of one subtype in calves worldwide and frequent detection of this subtype in humans suggests that parasite fitness probably plays an important role in transmission of cryptosporidiosis among cattle and in zoonotic infections.
the opioid system consists of three receptors, mu, delta, and kappa, which are activated by endogenous opioid peptides processed from three protein precursors, proopiomelanocortin, proenkephalin, and prodynorphin. opioid receptors are recruited in response to natural rewarding stimuli and drugs of abuse, and both endogenous opioids and their receptors are modified as addiction develops. mechanisms whereby aberrant activation and modifications of the opioid system contribute to drug craving and relapse remain to be clarified. this review summarizes our present knowledge on brain sites where the endogenous opioid system controls hedonic responses and is modified in response to drugs of abuse in the rodent brain. we review 1) the latest data on the anatomy of the opioid system, 2) the consequences of local intracerebral pharmacological manipulation of the opioid system on reinforced behaviors, 3) the consequences of gene knockout on reinforced behaviors and drug dependence, and 4) the consequences of chronic exposure to drugs of abuse on expression levels of opioid system genes. future studies will establish key molecular actors of the system and neural sites where opioid peptides and receptors contribute to the onset of addictive disorders. combined with data from human and nonhuman primate (not reviewed here), research in this extremely active field has implications both for our understanding of the biology of addiction and for therapeutic interventions to treat the disorder. the effects of a repeated treatment with nicotine on the expression of mrnas encoding preproenkephalin (ppe), preprotachykinin‐a (ppt‐a), and preprodynorphin (ppdyn) were examined by in situ hybridization histochemistry in various subregions of the nucleus accumbens (acb). in saline‐treated rats, optical density measurements on autoradiographic films showed marked anteroposterior decreasing gradients for ppe and ppt‐a mrnas in the rostral pole and the core, in the cone, and in the ventral shell of the acb, whereas a lower anteroposterior gradient was observed for ppdyn mrna signals. the intensity of the three mrna signals also varied according to acb subregion. however, analysis of percentages of prepropeptide mrna‐containing neurons as compared to total neurons showed, in the rostral pole, the core, and the cone, a similar percentage of ppe mrna (around 45%)‐ and ppt‐a mrna (around 40%)‐ expressing neurons. the ventral shell can be distinguished from the other subregions by a lower percentage of ppe mrna (35.8%)‐ and ppt‐a mrna (30.6%)‐expressing neurons. the percentage of ppdyn mrna‐containing neurons, by contrast, was similar (around 37%) in the core, the cone, and the ventral shell. repeated nicotine administration increases the ppe mrna level in the rostral pole and the anterior third of the core without any change in ppt‐a and ppdyn mrna levels in the various acb subregions examined. the ppe mrna increase does not support an effect mediated through an interaction of nicotine with da neurons. the effect could be linked to a nicotine activation of other afferents to the anterior acb and/or to a direct nicotine stimulation of ppe mrna neurons. © 1996 wiley‐liss, inc.
the paper presents a beat tracking algorithm for musical audio signals. the method firstly extracts musical change points from the help signal and then uses a particle filtering algorithm to associate these to a tempo process. results are comparable with the current state of the art. we present a probabilistic generative model for timing deviations in expressive music performance. the structure of the proposed model is equivalent to a switching state space model. the switch variables correspond to discrete note locations as in a musical score. the continuous hidden variables denote the tempo. we formulate two well known music recognition problems, namely tempo tracking and automatic transcription (rhythm quantization) as filtering and maximum a posteriori (map) state estimation tasks. exact computation of posterior features such as the map state is intractable in this model class, so we introduce monte carlo methods for integration and optimization. we compare markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) methods (such as gibbs sampling, simulated annealing and iterative improvement) and sequential monte carlo methods (particle filters). our simulation results suggest better results with sequential methods. the methods can be applied in both online and batch scenarios such as tempo tracking and transcription and are thus potentially useful in a number of music applications such as adaptive automatic accompaniment, score typesetting and music information retrieval.
aimed to find the additive magnitude automatically and adaptively, we propose a three-step and model-based approach for the sharpening of images in this paper. in the first pass, a grey prediction model is applied to find a global maximal additive magnitude so that the condition of oversharpening in images to be sharpened can be avoided. during the second pass, edge pixels are picked out with our previously proposed edge detection mechanism. in this pass, a low-pass filter is also applied so that isolated pixels will not be regarded as around an edge. in the final pass, those pixels detected as around an edge are adjusted adaptively based on the local statistics, and those nonedge pixels are kept unaltered. extensive experiments on natural images as well as medical images with subjective and objective evaluations will be given to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach. this paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. the success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. these goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. we define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. a third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. we use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. on specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. with this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. the optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a gaussian-smoothed image. we extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. we present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.
reading braille activates visual cortex in blind people [burton et al., j neurophysiol 2002;87:589–611; sadato et al., nature 1996;380:526–528; sadato et al., brain 1998;121:1213–1229]. because learning braille requires extensive training, we had sighted and blind people read raised block capital letters to determine whether all groups engage visual cortex similarly when reading by touch. letters were passively rubbed across the right index finger at 30 mm/s using an mr‐compatible drum stimulator. age‐matched sighted, early blind (lost sight 0–5 years), and late blind (lost sight >5.5 years) volunteers performed three tasks: stating an identified letter, stating a verb containing an identified letter, and feeling a moving smooth surface. responses were voiced immediately after the drum stopped moving across the fingertip. all groups showed increased activity in visual areas v1 and v2 during both letter identification tasks. blind compared to sighted participants showed greater activation increases predominantly in the parafoveal‐peripheral portions of visuotopic areas and posterior parts of ba 20 and 37. sighted participants showed suppressed activity in most of the same areas except for small positive responses bilaterally in v1, left v5/mt+, and bilaterally in ba 37/20. blind individuals showed suppression of the language areas in the frontal cortex, while sighted individuals showed slight positive responses. early blind showed a more extensive distribution of activity in superior temporal sulcal multisensory areas. these results show cross‐modal reorganization of visual cortex and altered response dynamics in nonvisual areas that plausibly reflect mechanisms for adaptive plasticity in blindness. hum brain mapp, 2005. © 2005 wiley‐liss, inc. for functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of the neural substrates of language, the ability to have subjects performing overt verbal responses while in the scanner environment is important for several reasons. most directly, overt responses allow the investigator to measure the accuracy and reaction time of the behavior. one problem, however, is that magnetic resonance gradient noise obscures the audio recordings made of voice responses, making it difficult to discern subject responses and to calculate reaction times. assert (adaptive spectral subtraction for extracting response times), an algorithm for removing mr gradient noise from audio recordings of subject responses, is described here. the signal processing improves intelligibility of the responses and also allows automated extraction of reaction times. the assert-derived response times were comparable to manually measured times with a mean difference of -8.75 ms (standard deviation of difference = 26.2 ms). these results support the use of assert for the purpose of extracting response latencies and scoring overt verbal responses.
background: recently mixed linear models are used to address the issue of “missing" heritability in traditional genome-wide association studies (gwas). the models assume that all single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) are associated with the phenotypes of interest. however, it is more common that only a small proportion of snps have significant effects on the phenotypes, while most snps have no or very small effects. to incorporate this feature, we propose an efficient hierarchical bayesian model (hbm) that extends the existing mixed models to enforce automatic selection of significant snps. the hbm models the snp effects using a mixture distribution of a point mass at zero and a normal distribution, where the point mass corresponds to those non-associative snps. results: we estimate the hbm using gibbs sampling. the estimation performance of our method is first demonstrated through two simulation studies. we make the simulation setups realistic by using parameters fitted on the framingham heart study (fhs) data. the simulation studies show that our method can accurately estimate the proportion of snps associated with the simulated phenotype and identify these snps, as well as adapt to certain model mis-specification than the standard mixed models. in addition, we analyze data from the fhs and the health and retirement study (hrs) to study the association between body mass index (bmi) and snps on chromosome 16, and replicate the identified genetic associations. the analysis of the fhs data identifies 0.3% snps on chromosome 16 that affect bmi, including rs9939609 and rs9939973 on the fto gene. these two snps are in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs1558902 (rsq=0.901 for rs9939609 and rsq=0.905 for rs9939973), which has been reported to be linked with obesity in previous gwas. we then replicate the findings using the hrs data: the analysis finds 0.4% of snps associated with bmi on chromosome 16. furthermore, around 25% of the genes that are identified to be associated with bmi are common between the two studies. conclusions: the results demonstrate that the hbm and the associated estimation algorithm offer a powerful tool for identifying significant genetic associations with phenotypes of interest, among a large number of snps that are common in modern genetics studies. abstract a crucial problem in building a multiple regression model is the selection of predictors to include. the main thrust of this article is to propose and develop a procedure that uses probabilistic considerations for selecting promising subsets. this procedure entails embedding the regression setup in a hierarchical normal mixture model where latent variables are used to identify subset choices. in this framework the promising subsets of predictors can be identified as those with higher posterior probability. the computational burden is then alleviated by using the gibbs sampler to indirectly sample from this multinomial posterior distribution on the set of possible subset choices. those subsets with higher probability—the promising ones—can then be identified by their more frequent appearance in the gibbs sample.
objectives our objective was to test the hypothesis that the ultrasound pulsing interval (pi), microbubble injection site and microvascular pressure significantly influence the transport of 100-nm microspheres to muscle through extravasation sites created by the destruction of microbubbles with ultrasound.   background microbubbles show promise as targeted drug and gene delivery agents; however, designing optimal microbubble-based therapies will require an understanding of the factors that influence the transport of microbubble-delivered, gene-bearing vehicles to tissue.   methods ultrasound at 1 mhz, with a peak negative pressure amplitude of 0.75 mpa, was applied to microbubbles and 100-nm microspheres in exteriorized rat spinotrapezius muscle. ultrasound pis of 1, 3, 5 and 10 s, arterial microsphere injection times of 10 or 40 s and arterial versus venous injection sites were tested.   results extravasation point creation and microsphere delivery were greatest when the ultrasound pi was 5 or 10 s. no significant differences in extravasation point creation or microsphere delivery were observed with arterial versus venous microbubble injection, but a trend toward increased microsphere delivery with arterial injection may exist. decreasing the arterial injection time from 40 to 10 s increased microvascular pressure, which, in turn, substantially enhanced microsphere transport to tissue, without a concomitant increase in the number of extravasation points.   conclusions the ultrasound pi and microvascular pressure significantly influence the creation of extravasation points and the transport of microspheres to tissue. these factors may be important in designing and optimizing contrast ultrasound-based therapies. background we have previously shown that the application of ultrasound to thin-shelled microbubbles flowing through small microvessels (<7 microm in diameter) produces vessel wall ruptures in vivo. because many intravascular drug- and gene-delivery vehicles are limited by the endothelial barrier, we hypothesized that this phenomenon could be used to deliver drug-bearing vehicles to tissue.   methods and results an exteriorized rat spinotrapezius muscle preparation was used. intravascular fluorescent red blood cells and polymer microspheres (pm) (205 and 503 nm in diameter) were delivered to the interstitium of rat skeletal muscle through microvessel ruptures created by insonifying microbubbles in vivo. on intravital microscopy, mean dispersion areas per rupture for red blood cells, 503-nm pm, and 205-nm pm were 14.5x10(3) microm2, 24. 2x10(3) microm2, and 27.2x10(3) microm2, respectively. pm dispersion areas were significantly larger than the mean dispersion area for red blood cells (p<0.05).   conclusions microvessel ruptures caused by insonification of microbubbles in vivo may provide a minimally invasive means for delivering colloidal particles and engineered red blood cells across the endothelial lining of a targeted tissue region.
the precise temporal and spatial activity patterns of neurons in cortical networks are organized by different state‐dependent types of network oscillations. gabaergic inhibition plays a key role in the underlying mechanisms of such oscillations and it has been suggested that the duration of widely distributed phasic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (ipsps) determines the frequency of the resulting network oscillation. here, we test this hypothesis in an in vitro model of sharp wave–ripple (spw‐r) complexes, a particularly fast pattern of network oscillations at ∼200 hz which is involved in memory consolidation. we recorded spw‐r in mouse hippocampal slices in the absence and presence of ncc‐711, an inhibitor of gaba uptake. the resulting prolongation of ipsp resulted in reduced occurrence of spw‐r, whereas the superimposed fast oscillations as well as the precision of rhythmic cell synchronization remained stable. application of diazepam which is a positive modulator of the gabaa receptor led to consistent results. we conclude that phasic inhibition is a major regulator of network excitability in ca3 (where spw‐rs are generated), but does not set the frequency of hippocampal ripples. © 2013 wiley periodicals, inc. cognitive functions go along with complex patterns of distributed activity in neuronal networks, thereby forming assemblies of selected neurons. to support memory processes, such assemblies have to be stabilized and reactivated in a highly reproducible way. the rodent hippocampus provides a well studied model system for network mechanisms underlying spatial memory formation. assemblies of place-encoding cells are repeatedly activated during sleep-associated network states called sharp wave–ripple complexes (spw-rs). behavioral studies suggest that at any time the hippocampus harbors a limited number of different assemblies that are transiently stabilized for memory consolidation. we hypothesized that the corresponding field potentials (sharp wave–ripple complexes) contain a specific signature of the underlying neuronal activity patterns. hence, they should fall into a limited number of different waveforms. application of unbiased sorting algorithms to sharp wave–ripple complexes in mouse hippocampal slices did indeed reveal the reliable recurrence of defined waveforms that were robust over prolonged recording periods. single-unit discharges tended to fire selectively with certain spw-r classes and were coupled above chance level. thus, field spw-rs of different waveforms are directly related to the underlying multicellular activity patterns that recur with high fidelity. this direct relationship between the coordinated activity of distinct groups of neurons and macroscopic electrographic signals may be important for cognition-related physiological studies in humans and behaving animals.
this paper addresses the issue of identifying persons with expertise knowledge on a given topic. traditional methods usually estimate the relevance between the query and the support documents of candidate experts using, for example, a language model. however, the language model lacks the ability of identifying semantic knowledge, thus results in some right experts cannot be found due to not occurrence of the query terms in the support documents. in this paper, we propose a mixture model based on probabilistic latent semantic analysis (plsa) to estimate a hidden semantic theme layer between the terms and the support documents. the hidden themes are used to capture the semantic relevance between the query and the experts. we evaluate our mixture model in a real-world system, arnetminer. experimental results indicate that the proposed model outperforms the language models. this paper examines whether the cranfield evaluation methodology is robust to gross violations of the completeness assumption (i.e., the assumption that all relevant documents within a test collection have been identified and are present in the collection). we show that current evaluation measures are not robust to substantially incomplete relevance judgments. a new measure is introduced that is both highly correlated with existing measures when complete judgments are available and more robust to incomplete judgment sets. this finding suggests that substantially larger or dynamic test collections built using current pooling practices should be viable laboratory tools, despite the fact that the relevance information will be incomplete and imperfect.
domain adaptation methods aim at building classifiers that are robust to mismatched distributions in training and test. in computer vision such a mismatch can have several causes. some are related to the image acquisition process like differences in the camera quality, variations in background, viewpoint and illumination conditions [7]. others depend on higher level changes like moving from painting or sketches to real pictures of the same object or scene [8]. one further possible cause of domain shift that has not been studied yet is the design variation over time. for instance, think about what we call telephone today and its evolution in terms of visual aspect since the beginning of the 20th century (figure 1, left). the same happens for fine-grained object categories like cars. many contemporary car models are the successors of models that were introduced decades ago and still keep the same name, despite the change in appearance (figure 1, right). here we focus on this domain shift and we analyze how the state of the art domain adaptation methods perform over it. for this purpose we defined a new testbed by collecting a car evolution dataset 1. in real-world applications of visual recognition, many factors - such as pose, illumination, or image quality - can cause a significant mismatch between the source domain on which classifiers are trained and the target domain to which those classifiers are applied. as such, the classifiers often perform poorly on the target domain. domain adaptation techniques aim to correct the mismatch. existing approaches have concentrated on learning feature representations that are invariant across domains, and they often do not directly exploit low-dimensional structures that are intrinsic to many vision datasets. in this paper, we propose a new kernel-based method that takes advantage of such structures. our geodesic flow kernel models domain shift by integrating an infinite number of subspaces that characterize changes in geometric and statistical properties from the source to the target domain. our approach is computationally advantageous, automatically inferring important algorithmic parameters without requiring extensive cross-validation or labeled data from either domain. we also introduce a metric that reliably measures the adaptability between a pair of source and target domains. for a given target domain and several source domains, the metric can be used to automatically select the optimal source domain to adapt and avoid less desirable ones. empirical studies on standard datasets demonstrate the advantages of our approach over competing methods.
we study the problem of large scale, multi-label visual recognition with a large number of possible classes. we propose a method for augmenting a trained neural network classifier with auxiliary capacity in a manner designed to significantly improve upon an already well-performing model, while minimally impacting its computational footprint. using the predictions of the network itself as a descriptor for assessing visual similarity, we define a partitioning of the label space into groups of visually similar entities. we then augment the network with auxilliary hidden layer pathways with connectivity only to these groups of label units. we report a significant improvement in mean average precision on a large-scale object recognition task with the augmented model, while increasing the number of multiply-adds by less than 3%. despite many empirical successes of spectral clustering methods— algorithms that cluster points using eigenvectors of matrices derived from the data—there are several unresolved issues. first. there are a wide variety of algorithms that use the eigenvectors in slightly different ways. second, many of these algorithms have no proof that they will actually compute a reasonable clustering. in this paper, we present a simple spectral clustering algorithm that can be implemented using a few lines of matlab. using tools from matrix perturbation theory, we analyze the algorithm, and give conditions under which it can be expected to do well. we also show surprisingly good experimental results on a number of challenging clustering problems.
the authors addressed whether individual differences in the working memory capacity (wmc) of young adults influence susceptibility to false memories for nonpresented critical words in the deese-roediger-mcdermott associative list paradigm. the results of 2 experiments indicated that individuals with greater wmc recalled fewer critical words than individuals with reduced wmc when participants were forewarned about the tendency of associative lists (e.g., bed, rest, . . .) to elicit illusory memories for critical words (e.g., sleep). in contrast, both high and low wmc participants used repeated study-test trials to reduce recall of critical words. these findings suggest that individual differences in wmc influence cognitive control and the ability to actively maintain task goals in the face of interfering information or habit. r. e. smith and r. r. hunt (1998) reported a dramatic reduction in false remembering in a list-learning paradigm by switching from auditory to visual presentation at study. the current authors replicated these modality effects using written recall and visual recognition tests but obtained smaller effects than those in r. e. smith and r. r. hunt's study. in contrast, no modality effect occurred on auditory recognition tests. manipulating study and test modality within-subjects (experiment 2) and between-subjects (experiment 3) yielded similar results. it was also found that subjects frequently judged critical nonstudied words as having been presented in the modality of their corresponding study lists. the authors concluded that subjects could retrieve distinctive information about a study list's presentation modality to reduce false remembering but only did so under certain conditions. the modality effect on false remembering is a function of both encoding and retrieval factors.
abstract context: terminalia chebula retz (combretaceae) and musa balbisiana colla (musaceae) have a traditional reputation as a male contraceptive. objective: to determine the hypo-testicular activity of aqueous extracts of terminalia chebula (fruit) and musa balbisiana (seed) separately, and in composite manner at the ratio of 1:1 named as ‘contracept-tm’ compared to cyproterone acetate (cpa), for developing a polyherbal contraceptive. materials and methods: the separate extract of above said plants or ‘contracept-tm’ at the dose of 40 mg/100 g body weight of rat/day or cpa at 2 mg/100 g body weight of rat/day was administered for 28 days. spermiological, androgenic and oxidative stress sensors, ld50 and ed50/100 g body weight values were measured. results: treatment of individual, ‘contracept-tm’ or cpa resulted significant decrease in the count of spermatogonia a (36.36–49.09%), pre-leptotene spermatocyte (19.11–55.30%), mid-pachytene spermatocyte (28.65–47.28%) and step 7 spermatid (29.65–51.59%). activities of testicular δ5, 3β (21.25–48.02%),17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (29.75–55.08%), catalase (19.06–43.29%) and peroxidase (30.76–62.82%), levels of testosterone (28.15–63.44%), testicular cholesterol (19.61–49.33%), conjugated diene (29.69–84.99%) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (41.25–86.73%) were elevated compare to the control. the ed50 and ld50 values were 40 mg and 5.8 g (t. chebula), 48 mg and 6.3 g (m. bulbisiana), 40 mg and 6.0 g (‘contracept-tm’), respectively. discussion and conclusion: the said spermiological and androgenic sensors’ levels were decreased significantly by ‘contracept-tm’ than its constitutional individual plant extract and it may be comparable to standard anti-testicular drug like cpa. so, it may be concluded that above polyherbal formulation is potent for inducing hypo-testicular activity. an enzymatic method is described for determination of total serum cholesterol by use of a single aqueous reagent. the method requires no prior treatment of sample and the calibration curve is linear to 600 mg/dl. cholesterol esters are hydrolyzed to free cholesterol by cholesterol ester hydrolase (ec 3.1.1.13). the free cholesterol produced is oxidized by cholesterol oxidase to cholest-4-en-3-one with the simultaneous production of hydrogen peroxide, which oxidatively couples with 4-aminoantipyrine and phenol in the presence of peroxidase to yield a chromogen with maximum absorption at 500 nm. the method is reproducible, and the results correlate well with those obtained by automated liebermann—burchard procedures (aa-2 and sma 12/60) and the method of abell et al. the present method affords better specificity than those previously reported and has excellent precision.
the performance of gene prediction programs strongl y depends on the methods that they use to locate sp lice sites. different pattern recognition techniques ar e available to assess the quality of candidate spli ce sites, see [1] for an overview and further references. all of thes e techniques proceed by computing a score derived from the distribution of the nucleotides in the neighbourhoo d of a splice site consensus sequence. these score s are normally obtained with splice sites models that hav e been estimated from large training sets of exempl ary neighbourhoods. the training sets may also include negative examples, i.e. sequences that contain the consensus sequence, but that are actually no splice sites. u nfortunately, the concept of ‘neighbourhood’ is rat her ambiguous, and there is no general recommendation a b ut the positions of the nucleotides that should b e included in the calculation, i.e. the analysis wind ow that should be employed. in principle, the windo w length is an important parameter, because it determines the a mount of information that has to be evaluated. on the one hand, the window should be long enough to provide a s m ny details as possible about the patterns. on the other hand, the window should be short enough to take onl y the relevant information, in order to improve generalization. in the present study, we investigat e how splice-site prediction accuracy depends on th e window size and shape, using support vector machines (svm) [2]. our results show that the choice of the windo w is crucial for splice site prediction, and therefore w suggest that the window length should be consider ed as an essential parameter of the model. we describe a novel analytical approach to gene recognition based on cross-species comparison we first undertook a comparison of orthologous genomic look from human and mouse, studying the extent of similarity in the number, size and sequence of exons and introns we then developed an approach for recognizing genes within such orthologous regions, by first aligning the regions using an iterative global alignment system and then identifying genes based on conservation of exonic features at aligned positions in both species the alignment and gene recognition are performed by new programs called glass and rosetta, respectively rosetta performed well at exact identification of coding exons in 117 orthologous pairs tested.
vector representation of words improves performance in various nlp tasks, but the high dimensional word vectors are very difficult to interpret. we apply several rotation algorithms to the vector representation of words to improve the interpretability. unlike previous approaches that induce sparsity, the rotated vectors are interpretable while preserving the expressive performance of the original vectors. furthermore, any prebuilt word vector representation can be rotated for improved interpretability. we apply rotation to skipgrams and glove and compare the expressive power and interpretability with the original vectors and the sparse overcomplete vectors. the results show that the rotated vectors outperform the original and the sparse overcomplete vectors for interpretability and expressiveness tasks. recent methods for learning vector space representations of words have succeeded in capturing fine-grained semantic and syntactic regularities using vector arithmetic, but the origin of these regularities has remained opaque. we analyze and make explicit the model properties needed for such regularities to emerge in word vectors. the result is a new global logbilinear regression model that combines the advantages of the two major model families in the literature: global matrix factorization and local context window methods. our model efficiently leverages statistical information by training only on the nonzero elements in a word-word cooccurrence matrix, rather than on the entire sparse matrix or on individual context windows in a large corpus. the model produces a vector space with meaningful substructure, as evidenced by its performance of 75% on a recent word analogy task. it also outperforms related models on similarity tasks and named entity recognition.
br-signaling kinase1 (bsk1) is a substrate of the brassinosteroid receptor bri1. this work shows that bsk1 physically associates with fls2, and a mutation in bsk1 leads to enhanced susceptibility to multiple pathogens as well as defects in the fls2-mediated reactive oxygen burst, demonstrating that bsk1 plays an important role in plant innate immunity. pathogen-associated molecular pattern (pamp)-trigged immunity (pti) is the first defensive line of plant innate immunity and is mediated by pattern recognition receptors. here, we show that a mutation in br-signaling kinase1 (bsk1), a substrate of the brassinosteroid (br) receptor brassinosteroid insensitive1, suppressed the powdery mildew resistance caused by a mutation in enhanced disease resistance2, which negatively regulates powdery mildew resistance and programmed cell death, in arabidopsis thaliana. a loss-of-function bsk1 mutant displayed enhanced susceptibility to virulent and avirulent pathogens, including golovinomyces cichoracearum, pseudomonas syringae, and hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis. the bsk1 mutant also accumulated lower levels of salicylic acid upon infection with g. cichoracearum and p. syringae. bsk1 belongs to a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase family and displays kinase activity in vitro; this kinase activity is required for its function. bsk1 physically associates with the pamp receptor flagellin sensing2 and is required for a subset of flg22-induced responses, including the reactive oxygen burst, but not for mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. our data demonstrate that bsk1 is involved in positive regulation of pti. together with previous findings, our work indicates that bsk1 represents a key component directly involved in both br signaling and plant immunity. we have identified an arabidopsis mutant that displays enhanced disease resistance (edr2) to the biotrophic powdery mildew pathogen erysiphe cichoracearum. inhibition of fungal growth on edr2 mutant leaves occurred at a late stage of the infection process and coincided with formation of necrotic lesions approximately 5 days after inoculation. double-mutant analysis revealed that edr2-mediated resistance is suppressed by mutations that inhibit salicylic acid (sa)-induced defense signaling, including npr1, pad4 and sid2, demonstrating that edr2-mediated disease resistance is dependent on sa. however, edr2 showed normal responses to the bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain dc3000. edr2 appears to be constitutively transcribed in all tissues and organs and encodes a novel protein, consisting of a putative pleckstrin homology (ph) domain and a steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid-transfer (start) domain, and contains an n-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence. the ph and start domains are implicated in lipid binding, suggesting that edr2 may provide a link between lipid signaling and activation of programmed cell death mediated by mitochondria.
the β-cyanoalanine synthase enzyme is responsible for detoxifying the cyanide generated during cellular metabolism, primarily in the synthesis of ethylene. this analysis of a null mutant of this enzyme indicates that cyanide can act in some developmental processes as a signaling molecule. cyanide is stoichiometrically produced as a coproduct of the ethylene biosynthesis pathway and is detoxified by β-cyanoalanine synthase enzymes. the molecular and phenotypical analysis of t-dna insertion mutants of the mitochondrial β-cyanoalanine synthase cys-c1 suggests that discrete accumulation of cyanide is not toxic for the plant and does not alter mitochondrial respiration rates but does act as a strong inhibitor of root hair development. the cys-c1 null allele is defective in root hair formation and accumulates cyanide in root tissues. the root hair defect is phenocopied in wild-type plants by the exogenous addition of cyanide to the growth medium and is reversed by the addition of hydroxocobalamin or by genetic complementation with the cys-c1 gene. hydroxocobalamin not only recovers the root phenotype of the mutant but also the formation of reactive oxygen species at the initial step of root hair tip growth. transcriptional profiling of the cys-c1 mutant reveals that cyanide accumulation acts as a repressive signal for several genes encoding enzymes involved in cell wall rebuilding and the formation of the root hair tip as well as genes involved in ethylene signaling and metabolism. our results demonstrate that mitochondrial β-cyanoalanine synthase activity is essential to maintain a low level of cyanide for proper root hair development. motivation dna microarrays have recently been used for the purpose of monitoring expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously and identifying those genes that are differentially expressed. the probability that a false identification (type i error) is committed can increase sharply when the number of tested genes gets large. correlation between the test statistics attributed to gene co-regulation and dependency in the measurement errors of the gene expression levels further complicates the problem. in this paper we address this very large multiplicity problem by adopting the false discovery rate (fdr) controlling approach. in order to address the dependency problem, we present three resampling-based fdr controlling procedures, that account for the test statistics distribution, and compare their performance to that of the naïve application of the linear step-up procedure in benjamini and hochberg (1995). the procedures are studied using simulated microarray data, and their performance is examined relative to their ease of implementation.   results comparative simulation analysis shows that all four fdr controlling procedures control the fdr at the desired level, and retain substantially more power then the family-wise error rate controlling procedures. in terms of power, using resampling of the marginal distribution of each test statistics substantially improves the performance over the naïve one. the highest power is achieved, at the expense of a more sophisticated algorithm, by the resampling-based procedures that resample the joint distribution of the test statistics and estimate the level of fdr control.   availability an r program that adjusts p-values using fdr controlling procedures is freely available over the internet at www.math.tau.ac.il/~ybenja.
abstract. a 4-week quality of life (qol) study was conducted in 157 consecutive advanced cancer patients to compare five qol measures and to assess changes in qol during the course of the study. the study patients were representative of the advanced cancer population in the usa, and were similar to the advanced cancer population with respect to age and gender. global qol measures appear to be as effective as multidimensional measures in assessing qol in patients with advanced cancer. generally, qol was rated as satisfactory and did not change markedly during the study period. purpose we developed and validated a brief, yet sensitive, 33-item general cancer quality-of-life (ql) measure for evaluating patients receiving cancer treatment, called the functional assessment of cancer therapy (fact) scale.   methods and results the five-phase validation process involved 854 patients with cancer and 15 oncology specialists. the initial pool of 370 overlapping items for breast, lung, and colorectal cancer was generated by open-ended interview with patients experienced with the symptoms of cancer and oncology professionals. using preselected criteria, items were reduced to a 38-item general version. factor and scaling analyses of these 38 items on 545 patients with mixed cancer diagnoses resulted in the 28-item fact-general (fact-g, version 2). in addition to a total score, this version produces subscale scores for physical, functional, social, and emotional well-being, as well as satisfaction with the treatment relationship. coefficients of reliability and validity were uniformly high. the scale's ability to discriminate patients on the basis of stage of disease, performance status rating (psr), and hospitalization status supports its sensitivity. it has also demonstrated sensitivity to change over time. finally, the validity of measuring separate areas, or dimensions, of ql was supported by the differential responsiveness of subscales when applied to groups known to differ along the dimensions of physical, functional, social, and emotional well-being.   conclusion the fact-g meets or exceeds all requirements for use in oncology clinical trials, including ease of administration, brevity, reliability, validity, and responsiveness to clinical change. selecting it for a clinical trial adds the capability to assess the relative weight of various aspects of ql from the patient's perspective.
objectivesto generate lycopene-overproducing strains of the fungus mucor circinelloides with interest for industrial production and to gain insight into the catalytic mechanism of lycopene cyclase and regulatory process during lycopene overaccumulation.resultsthree lycopene-overproducing mutants were generated by classic mutagenesis techniques from a β-carotene-overproducing strain. they carried distinct mutations in the carrp gene encoding lycopene cyclase that produced loss of enzymatic activity to different extents. in one mutant (mu616), the lycopene cyclase was completely destroyed, and a 43.8% (1.1 mg/g dry mass) increase in lycopene production was observed in comparison to that by the previously existing lycopene overproducer. in addition, feedback regulation of the end product was suggested in lycopene-overproducing strains.conclusionsa lycopene-overaccumulating strain of the fungus m. circinelloides was generated that could be an alternative for the industrial production of lycopene. vital catalytic residues for lycopene cyclase activity and the potential mechanism of lycopene formation and accumulation were identified. sexual crosses between strains of phycomyces blakesleeanus , involving three auxotrophic and one color marker and yielding a high proportion of zygospore germination, are described. samples of 20-40 germ spores from 311 individual fertile germ sporangia originating from five two-factor and three three-factor crosses were characterized. the results show: (1) absence of any contribution of apogamic nuclei to the progeny, (2) confirmation of burgeff's conjecture that the germ spores of any germ sporangium in most cases derive from one meiosis. in a cross involving two allelic markers the analysis of 175 pooled germ sporangia suggests an intragenic recombination frequency of 0.6%. all other factor combinations tested are unlinked. the bulk of the germ spores are homokaryotic. however, a small portion (4%) are heterokaryotic with respect to mating type.
the necrotrophic fungus parastagonospora nodorum is an important pathogen of one of the world’s most economically important cereal crops, wheat (triticum aestivum l.). p. nodorum produces necrotrophic protein effectors that mediate host cell death, providing nutrients for continuation of the infection process. the recent discovery of pathogen effectors has revolutionized disease resistance breeding for necrotrophic diseases in crop species, allowing often complex genetic resistance mechanisms to be broken down into constituent parts. to date, three effectors have been identified in p. nodorum. here we use the effector, sntox1, to screen 642 progeny from an eight-parent multiparent advanced generation inter-cross (i.e., magic) population, genotyped with a 90,000-feature single-nucleotide polymorphism array. the magic founders showed a range of sensitivity to sntox1, with transgressive segregation evident in the progeny. sntox1 sensitivity showed high heritability, with quantitative trait locus analyses fine-mapping the snn1 locus to the short arm of chromosome 1b. in addition, a previously undescribed sntox1 sensitivity locus was identified on the long arm of chromosome 5a, termed here qsnn.niab-5a.1. the peak single-nucleotide polymorphism for the snn1 locus was converted to the kasp genotyping platform, providing breeders and researchers a simple and cheap diagnostic marker for allelic state at snn1. high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) genotyping arrays are a powerful tool for studying genomic patterns of diversity, inferring ancestral relationships between individuals in populations and studying marker–trait associations in mapping experiments. we developed a genotyping array including about 90 000 gene-associated snps and used it to characterize genetic variation in allohexaploid and allotetraploid wheat populations. the array includes a significant fraction of common genome-wide distributed snps that are represented in populations of diverse geographical origin. we used density-based spatial clustering algorithms to enable high-throughput genotype calling in complex data sets obtained for polyploid wheat. we show that these model-free clustering algorithms provide accurate genotype calling in the presence of multiple clusters including clusters with low signal intensity resulting from significant sequence divergence at the target snp site or gene deletions. assays that detect low-intensity clusters can provide insight into the distribution of presence–absence variation (pav) in wheat populations. a total of 46 977 snps from the wheat 90k array were genetically mapped using a combination of eight mapping populations. the developed array and cluster identification algorithms provide an opportunity to infer detailed haplotype structure in polyploid wheat and will serve as an invaluable resource for diversity studies and investigating the genetic basis of trait variation in wheat.
intravenous thrombolysis (ivt) is an established treatment in patients suffering from acute ischemic stroke (ais). ivt might increase the risk of postoperative complications if applied prior to decompressive craniectomy (dc). therefore, we analyzed the management of patients with and without ivt prior to dc. between 1999 and 2011, dc was performed in 115 patients after ais. patients with and without ivt prior to dc were compared regarding perioperative management, postoperative complications and outcome. postoperative complications were stratified into non-bleeding and bleeding complications. outcome was assessed using the modified rankin scale after three months. two multivariate analyses were performed to identify predictors for postoperative complications and predictors for unfavourable outcome (mrs 4–6). fifty-two of 115 patients underwent ivt prior to dc (45 %). forty-four patients were on antiplatelet therapy prior to dc (38 %). frequency of bleeding complications did not differ significantly in patients with ivt prior to dc compared to patients without. however, bleeding complications occurred significantly more often in patients with antiplatelet use prior to dc (p = 0.0003, or 4.5). in the multivariate analysis “preoperative use of acetylsalicylic acid” was the only independent predictor associated with bleeding complications (p = 0.002, or 3.9). ivt prior to dc did not predict unfavourable outcome. there was no evidence in this observational study that ivt prior to dc places patients at undue risk of bleeding complications after subsequent dc. patients with or without ivt prior to dc suffered significantly more often from postoperative bleeding complications if antiplatelet therapy was applied before onset of ais. object the object of this study was to describe the rapid closure technique in decompressive craniectomy without duraplasty and its use in a large cohort of consecutive patients.   methods between 1999 and 2008, supratentorial rapid closure decompressive craniectomy (rcdc) was performed 341 times in 318 patients at the authors' institution. cases were stratified as 1) traumatic brain injury, 2) subarachnoid hemorrhage, 3) intracerebral hemorrhage, 4) cerebral infarction, and 5) other. a large bone flap was removed and the dura mater was opened in a stellate fashion. duraplasty was not performed-that is, the dura was not sutured, and a dural substitute was neither sutured in nor layed on. the dura and exposed brain tissue were covered with hemostyptic material (surgicel). surgical time and complications of this procedure including follow-up (> 6 months) were recorded. after 3-6 months cranioplasty was performed, and, again, surgical time and any complications were recorded.   results rapid closure decompressive craniectomy was feasible in all cases. complications included superficial wound healing disturbance (3.5% of procedures), abscess (2.6%) and csf fistula (0.6%); the mean surgical time (± sd) was 69 ± 20 minutes. cranioplasty was performed in 196 cases; the mean interval (± sd) from craniectomy to cranioplasty was 118 ± 40 days. complications of cranioplasty included epidural hematoma (4.1%), abscess (2.6%), wound healing disturbance (6.1%), and csf fistula (1%). compared with the results reported in the literature for decompressive craniectomy with duraplasty followed by cranioplasty, there were no significant differences in the frequency of complications. however, surgical time for rcdc was significantly shorter (69 ± 20 vs 129 ± 43 minutes, p < 0.0001).   conclusions the present analysis of the largest series reported to date reveals that the rapid closure technique is feasible and safe in decompressive craniectomy. the surgical time is significantly shorter without increased complication rates or additional complications. cranioplasty after a rcdc procedure was also feasible, fast, safe and not impaired by the rcdc technique.
the study aimed to determine the relationship between throat microbiome and copd. sixty-five chinese males (n=20, smokers without copd; n=45 smokers with copd) were included. nonmetric multidimensional scaling indicated differences of microbiome between copd and controls, but no difference was observed between copd patients with differing degrees of lung function or disease severity. rarefaction analyses suggested that operational taxonomic units (otus, species-level) richness decreased in copd. the dominant taxa between copd and controls were similar, but the proportions of taxonomic distribution were different. the dominant phyla were bacteroidetes, proteobacteria, firmicutes and fusobacteria. the dominant genera were haemophilus, leptotrichia, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, veillonella, streptococcus, neisseria and prevotella. two dominant otus, otu3 (veillonella_dispar) and otu4 (streptococcus_unclassified), were identified. otu3 and its father-level taxa, which were negatively correlated with predicted percent of forced expiratory volume in a second (fev1%pred), were increased in copd. by contrast, otu4 and its father-level taxa, which were positively correlated with fev1%pred, were decreased in copd. otu4 also showed a slight potential as a copd biomarker. to conclude, the throat microbiome was different between smokers with or without copd, which is similar to findings from the lower respiratory tract. this study may strengthen our understanding of the relationship between microbiomes of different airway sites and copd. abstract mothur aims to be a comprehensive software package that allows users to use a single piece of software to analyze community sequence data. it builds upon previous tools to provide a flexible and powerful software package for analyzing sequencing data. as a case study, we used mothur to trim, screen, and align sequences; calculate distances; assign sequences to operational taxonomic units; and describe the α and β diversity of eight marine samples previously characterized by pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene fragments. this analysis of more than 222,000 sequences was completed in less than 2 h with a laptop computer.
the cost of manual metadata production is high, especially for audiovisual content, where a time-consuming inspection is usually required in order to identify the most appropriate annotations. there is a growing need from digital content industries for solutions capable of automating such a process. in this work we present active, a platform for indexing and cataloging audiovisual collections through the automatic recognition of faces and speakers. adopted algorithms are described and our main contributions on people clustering and caption-based people identification are presented. results of experiments carried out on a set of tv shows and audio files are reported and analyzed. an overview of the whole architecture is presented as well, with a focus on chosen solutions for making the platform easily extensible (plug-ins) and for distributing cpu-intensive calculations across a network of computers. between october 2000 and december 2000, we collected a database of over 40,000 facial images of 68 people. using the cmu (carnegie mellon university) 3d room, we imaged each person across 13 different poses, under 43 different illumination conditions, and with four different expressions. we call this database the cmu pose, illumination and expression (pie) database. in this paper, we describe the imaging hardware, the collection procedure, the organization of the database, several potential uses of the database, and how to obtain the database.
abstract endoderm formation in the mammal is a complex process with two lineages forming during the first weeks of development, the primitive (or extraembryonic) endoderm, which is specified in the blastocyst, and the definitive endoderm that forms later, at gastrulation, as one of the germ layers of the embryo proper. fate mapping evidence suggests that the definitive endoderm arises as two waves, which potentially reflect two distinct cell populations. early primitive ectoderm-like (epl) cell differentiation has been used successfully to identify and characterise mechanisms regulating molecular gastrulation and lineage choice during differentiation. the roles of the p38 mapk family in the formation of definitive endoderm were investigated using epl cells and chemical inhibitors of p38 mapk activity. these approaches define a role for p38 mapk activity in the formation of the primitive streak and a second role in the formation of the definitive endoderm. characterisation of the definitive endoderm populations formed from epl cells demonstrates the formation of two distinct populations, defined by gene expression and ontogeny, that were analogous to the proximal and distal definitive endoderm populations of the embryo. formation of the proximal definitive endoderm was found to require p38 mapk activity and is correlated with molecular gastrulation, defined by the expression of brachyury (t). distal definitive endoderm formation also requires p38 mapk activity but can form when t expression is inhibited. understanding lineage complexity will be a prerequisite for the generation of endoderm derivatives for commercial and clinical use. transforming growth factor beta 1 (tgf beta 1) is shown here to be required for yolk sac haematopoiesis and endothelial differentiation. mice with a targeted mutation in the tgf beta 1 gene were examined to determine the cause of prenatal lethality, which occurs in 50% of homozygous tgf beta 1 null (tgf beta 1-/-) conceptions. 50% of tgf beta 1-/- and 25% of tgf beta 1-+-) conceptions. 50% of tgf beta 1-/- and 25% of tgf beta 1+/- conceptuses were found to die at around 10.5 dpc. the primary defects were restricted to extraembryonic tissues, namely the yolk sac vasculature and haematopoietic system. the embryos per se showed developmental retardation, oedema and necrosis, which were probably secondary to the extraembryonic lesions. the defect in vasculogenesis appeared to affect endothelial differentiation, rather than the initial appearance and outgrowth of endothelial cells. initial differentiation of yolk sac mesoderm to endothelial cells occurred, but defective differentiation resulted in inadequate capillary tube formation, and weak vessels with reduced cellular adhesiveness. defective haematopoiesis resulted in a reduced erythroid cell number within the yolk sac. defective yolk sac vasculogenesis and haematopoiesis were present either together, or in isolation of each other. the phenotypes are consistent with the observation of abundant tgf beta 1 gene expression in both endothelial and haematopoietic precursors. the data indicate that the primary effect of loss of tgf beta 1 function in vivo is not increased haematopoietic or endothelial cell proliferation, which might have been expected by deletion of a negative growth regulator, but defective haematopoiesis and endothelial differentiation.
backgroundthe state of florida continues to report significant gender, ethnic and racial disparities in trauma incidence, access to care and outcomes in the adult population. our objective was to assess pediatric injury profiles and ethnic/racial disparities of specific injuries in a regional trauma center (tc) in south florida.methodsretrospective data from november 2011 to december 2015 were obtained from the level 2 tc registry for children ≤21 years old. demographic, injury pattern, geographic area, injury scores and treatment data were analyzed.resultsone thousand six hundred ten patients, ages 0–21 years were cared for at the tc from 2011 to 2015.73% were males. mean age = 15.7 years. mortality was 2.3%. using zip code data and using geographic mapping, we identified two main clusters where injuries were occurring. a multinomial regression analysis demonstrated that hispanics had higher risks of falls (rr 10.4, 95% ci 2.7–29), motorcycle accidents (rr 3.7, 95% ci 1.7–8.2) and motor vehicle accidents (rr 6.4, 95% ci 3.6–11.4). black/african american children had higher risks of gunshot wounds and resultant mortality (p < 0.01).conclusionthere were racial, ethnic and gender disparities in the patterns of injury and outcomes among the youth attended at our tc. geographic mapping allowed us the identification of the zones in south florida where injuries were occurring. understanding the differences and using geographic mapping to identify regions of higher prevalence will complement planning for prevention programs. the injury severity score (5) (iss) is a scalar (single number) measure of anatomic injury, widely used in and an important contribution to trauma research. the iss is the sum of squares of the highest abbreviated injury scale (1-3) (ais) grade in each of the three most severely injured body regions. thus the iss is a summary measure of trauma to single or multiple body regions. per cent mortality for blunt injured patients has been shown to be related to iss (based on ais-76) and patient age (4-6). patients used to establish those relationships were treated in 1961 and 1967-1968. similar relationships for penetrating injuries have not been prepared because, until the 1985 version, the ais provided severity grades for blunt injuries only. the iss is frequently used to assess or compare the injury severity of patient populations (7, 10, 13, 16) and as the anatomic component of trauma patient characterizations used in evaluation of care and quality assurance methods (8). the ais first published in 1971, was developed to classify anatomic injury from motor vehicle-related trauma. it has been revised and broadened in scope in 1976, 1980, and 1985. changes in injury coding, trauma care delivery, and clinical management mandate the updating of relationships between severity measures and mortality from which conclusions regarding patient management or healthcare policy issues may be drawn. the present study uses the most recent ais version (ais-85) to derive relationships between mortality rate and the iss for comtemporary patients with blunt or penetrating injuries and identifies important properties of the iss which should be considered when the measure is used to compare case mix severity in different populations.(author/trrl)
background: unhealthy western dietary patterns lead to over-consumption of fat and advanced glycation end-products (ages), and these account for the developments of obesity, diabetes, and related metabolic disorders. certain amino acids (aas) have been recently demonstrated to improve glycemia and reduce adiposity. therefore, our primary aims were to examine whether feeding an isoleucine-enriched aa mixture (4.5% aas; ile: 3.0%, leu: 1.0%, val: 0.2%, arg: 0.3% in the drinking water) would affect adiposity development and prevent the impairments of glycemic control in rats fed with the fat/age-containing diet (fad). methods: twenty-four male sprague-dawley rats were assigned into 1) control diet (cd, n = 8), 2) fad diet (fad, n = 8), and 3) fad diet plus aa (fad/aa, n = 8). after 9-weeks intervention, the glycemic control capacity (glucose level, itt, and hba1c levels), body composition, and spontaneous locomotor activity (sla) were evaluated, and the fasting blood samples were collected for analyzing metabolic related hormones (insulin, leptin, adiponectin, and corticosterone). the adipose tissues were also surgically collected and weighed. results: fad rats showed significant increases in weight gain, body fat %, blood glucose, hba1c, leptin, and area under the curve of glucose during insulin tolerance test (itt-glucose-auc) in compared with the cd rats. however, the fasting levels of blood glucose, hba1c, leptin, and itt-glucose-auc did not differ between cd and fad/aa rats. fad/aa rats also showed a greater increase in serum testosterone. conclusion: the amino acid mixture consisting of ile, leu, val, and arg showed clear protective benefits on preventing the fad-induced obesity and impaired glycemic control. soleus muscles isolated from normal rats were incubated to evaluate whether or not leucine promotes glucose uptake under insulin-free conditions, using a labeled 2-deoxyglucose uptake assay. glucose uptake was promoted by 2mm leucine. a metabolite of leucine, alpha-ketoisocaproic acid (alpha-kic), also exhibited a similar stimulatory effect, although this was not as potent as leucine. stimulation of glucose uptake by leucine was completely canceled by pre-treatment with either 10 microm ly294002, a specific inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3-kinase), or 6 microm gf109203x, a specific inhibitor of protein kinase c (pkc). no significant change was observed by pre-treatment with 1 microm rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor). these results suggest that leucine stimulates glucose transport in skeletal muscle via pi3-kinase and pkc pathways independently of the mammalian target of mtor. they also suggest that leucine stimulates glucose transport by an insulin-independent mechanism.
abstractoncorhynchus mykiss exhibits a vast array of life histories, which increases its likelihood of persistence by spreading risk of extirpation among different pathways. the klamath river basin (california–oregon) provides a particularly interesting backdrop for the study of life history diversity in o. mykiss, in part because the river is slated for a historic and potentially influential dam removal and habitat recolonization project. we used scale and otolith strontium isotope (87sr/86sr) analyses to characterize life history diversity in wild o. mykiss from the lower klamath river basin. we also determined maternal origin (anadromous or nonanadromous) and migratory history (anadromous or nonanadromous) of o. mykiss and compared length and fecundity at age between anadromous (steelhead) and nonanadromous (rainbow trout) phenotypes of o. mykiss. we identified a total of 38 life history categories at maturity, which differed in duration of freshwater and ocean rearing, age at maturation, and incidence... abstractsteelhead oncorhynchus mykiss from several of the world's rivers display the half-pounder life history, a variant characterized by an amphidromous (and, less often, anadromous) return to freshwater in the year of initial ocean entry. we evaluated factors related to expression of the half-pounder life history in wild steelhead from the lower klamath river basin, california. we also evaluated fitness consequences of the half-pounder phenotype using a simple life history model that was parameterized with our empirical data and outputs from a regional survival equation. the incidence of the half-pounder life history differed among subbasins of origin and smolt ages. precocious maturation occurred in approximately 8% of half-pounders and was best predicted by individual length in freshwater preceding ocean entry. adult steelhead of the half-pounder phenotype were smaller and less fecund at age than adult steelhead of the alternative (ocean contingent) phenotype. however, our data suggest that fish of t...
many bacterial effector proteins that are delivered to host cells during infection are enzymes targeting host cell signalling. recently, legionella pneumophila effector lpg1137 was experimentally characterised as a serine protease that cleaves human syntaxin 17. we present strong bioinformatic evidence that lpg1137 is a homologue of mitochondrial carrier proteins and is not related to known serine proteases. we also discuss how this finding can be reconciled with the apparently contradictory experimental results. automated protein structure prediction is becoming a mainstream tool for biological research. this has been fueled by steady improvements of publicly available automated servers over the last decade, in particular their ability to build good homology models for an increasing number of targets by reliably detecting and aligning more and more remotely homologous templates. here, we describe the three fully automated versions of the hhpred server that participated in the community‐wide blind protein structure prediction competition casp8. what makes hhpred unique is the combination of usability, short response times (typically under 15 min) and a model accuracy that is competitive with those of the best servers in casp8. proteins 2009. © 2009 wiley‐liss, inc.
interaction design for domains that involve complex abstractions can present significant challenges. this problem is particularly acute in domains where users lack effective means to conceptualise and articulate relevant abstractions. in this thesis, we investigate the use of domain-specific conceptual metaphors to address the challenge of presenting complex abstractions, using tonal harmony as an extended case study.    this thesis presents a methodology for applying domain-specific conceptual metaphors to interactions designs for music. this domain involves complex abstractions where users with any degree of domain knowledge may have difficulty in articulating concepts. the methodology comprises several parts.    firstly, the thesis explores methods for systematically guiding conversation between musicians to elicit speech that describes music using conceptual metaphors. recommendations for the most suitable methods are made.    secondly, the thesis presents a methodology for identifying image schemas and conceptual metaphors from transcriptions of conversations between musicians. the methodology covers rules for identifying source image schemas and extrapolating conceptual metaphors.    thirdly, the thesis presents a methodology for evaluating existing music interaction designs using domain-specific conceptual metaphors. we demonstrate that this approach can be used to identify potential areas for improvement as well as tensions in the design between certain tasks or abstractions.    fourthly, the thesis presents a case study for the development of a conceptual metaphor-influenced design process. in the case study, a set of materials are developed to be used by participants in the design process to facilitate the mapping of conceptual metaphors to elements of an interaction design without requiring knowledge of conceptual metaphor theory.    finally, a pilot study is presented integrating the results of the conceptual metaphor-influenced design process into a consistent and useful prototype system. compromises and refinements to the design proposals made during the design process are discussed and the resulting system design is detailed. tangible interaction research has opened up new ways to interact with computers and extended our imagination of what is possible with digital systems. however, research on tangible user interfaces (tui) seems to have lost sight of the everyday situation of the majority of people who still work with standard computer systems. this paper investigates a design process for applying tui in a gui dominated domain while preserving the functionality of the traditional systems. we exemplify a user centered design process using (1) image schemas as a meta-language for analysis and design and (2) a systematic function allocation of digital and physical user interface elements. we demonstrate this process in the context of the redesign of an invoice verification and posting system of a german beverage company.
the capacity of automatically modeling photographic composition is valuable for many real-world machine vision applications such as digital photography, image retrieval, image understanding, and image aesthetics assessment. the triangle technique is among those indispensable composition methods on which professional photographers often rely. this paper proposes a system that can identify prominent triangle arrangements in two major categories of photographs: natural or urban scenes, and portraits. for the natural or urban scene pictures, the focus is on the effect of linear perspective. for portraits, we carefully examine the positioning of human subjects in a photo. we show that line analysis is highly advantageous for modeling composition in both categories. based on the detected triangles, new mathematical descriptors for composition are formulated and used to retrieve similar images. leveraging the rich source of high aesthetics photos online, similar approaches can potentially be incorporated in future smart cameras to enhance a person's photo composition skills. we present an algorithm that quickly and accurately estimates vanishing points in images of man-made environments. contrary to previously proposed solutions, ours is neither iterative nor relies on voting in the space of vanishing points. our formulation is based on a recently proposed algorithm for the simultaneous estimation of multiple models called j-linkage. our method avoids representing edges on the gaussian sphere and the computations and error measures are done in the image. we show that a consistency measure between a vanishing point and an edge of the image can be computed in closed-form while being geometrically meaningful. finally, given a set of estimated vanishing points, we show how this consistency measure can be used to identify the three vanishing points corresponding to the manhattan directions. we compare our algorithm with other approaches on the york urban database and show significant performance improvements.
recently there has been considerable interest in topic models based on the bag-of-features representation of images. the strong independence assumption inherent in the bag-of-features representation is not realistic however: patches often overlap and share underlying image structures. moreover, important information with respect to relative scales of the features is completely ignored, for the sake of scale invariance. considering both spatial and scale-based constraints one can derive spatially constrained natural feature hierarchies within images. we explore the use of topic models that build such spatially constrained scale-induced hierarchies of the features in an unsupervised fashion. our model uses standard topic models as a starting point. we then incorporate information about the hierarchical and spatial relations of the features into the model. we illustrate the hierarchical nature of the resulting models using datasets of natural images, including the msrc2 dataset as well as a challenging set of images of trees collected from the internet. this paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object or scene. the features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3d viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. the features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. this paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. the recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. this approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.
backgroundseveral studies have reported age-associated changes in dna methylation in the first few years of life and in adult populations, but the extent of such changes during childhood is less well studied. the goals of this study were to investigate to what degree intra-individual changes in dna methylation are associated with aging during childhood and dissect the methylation changes directly associated with aging from the effect mediated through variation in cell-type composition (ctc).resultswe performed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (rrbs) in peripheral whole-blood samples collected at 2, 10, and 16 years of age. we identified age-associated longitudinal changes in dna methylation at 346 cpgs in 178 genes. analyses separating the effect mediated by ctc variability across age identified 26 cpgs located in 12 genes that associated directly with age. hence, the ctc changes across age appear to act as a mediator of the observed dna methylation associated with age. the results were replicated using epityper in a second sample set selected from the same cohort. gene ontology analyses revealed enrichment of transcriptional regulation and developmental processes. further, comparisons of the mean dna methylation differences between the time points reveal greater differences between 2 to 10 years and 10 to 16 years, suggesting that the identified age-associated dna methylation patterns manifests in early childhood.conclusionsthis study reveals insights into the epigenetic dynamics associated with aging early in life. such information could ultimately provide clues and point towards molecular pathways that are susceptible to aging-related disease-associated epigenetic dysregulation. the central importance of epigenetics to the aging process is increasingly being recognized. here we perform a methylome-wide association study (mwas) of aging in whole blood dna from 718 individuals, aged 25-92 years (mean = 55). we sequenced the methyl-cpg-enriched genomic dna fraction, averaging 67.3 million reads per subject, to obtain methylation measurements for the ∼27 million autosomal cpgs in the human genome. following extensive quality control, we adaptively combined methylation measures for neighboring, highly-correlated cpgs into 4 344 016 cpg blocks with which we performed association testing. eleven age-associated differentially methylated regions (dmrs) passed bonferroni correction (p-value < 1.15 × 10(-8)). top findings replicated in an independent sample set of 558 subjects using pyrosequencing of bisulfite-converted dna (min p-value < 10(-30)). to examine biological themes, we selected 70 dmrs with false discovery rate of <0.1. of these, 42 showed hypomethylation and 28 showed hypermethylation with age. hypermethylated dmrs were more likely to overlap with cpg islands and shores. hypomethylated dmrs were more likely to be in regions associated with polycomb/regulatory proteins (e.g. ezh2) or histone modifications h3k27ac, h3k4m1, h3k4m2, h3k4m3 and h3k9ac. among genes implicated by the top dmrs were protocadherins, homeobox genes, mapks and ryanodine receptors. several of our dmrs are at genes with potential relevance for age-related disease. this study successfully demonstrates the application of next-generation sequencing to mwas, by interrogating a large proportion of the methylome and returning potentially novel age dmrs, in addition to replicating several loci implicated in previous studies using microarrays.
links between parents’ psychiatric symptoms and their children’s behavioral and emotional problems have been widely documented in previous research, and the search for moderators of this association has begun. however, family structure (single versus dual-parent households) has received little attention as a potential moderator, despite indirect evidence that risk may be elevated in single-parent homes. two other candidate moderators—youth gender and age—have been tested directly, but with inconsistent findings across studies, perhaps in part because studies have differed in whether they used youth clinical samples and in which informants (parents vs. youths) reported on youth problems. in the present study, we examined these three candidate moderators using a sample of exclusively clinic-referred youths (n = 333, 34 % girls, aged 7–14,) and assessing youth problems through both parent- and youth-reports. both family structure and youth gender emerged as robust moderators across parent and youth informants. parent symptoms were associated with youth internalizing and externalizing problems in single-parent but not dual-parent homes; and parent symptoms were associated with youth internalizing problems among boys, but not girls. the moderator findings suggest that the risks associated with parent psychopathology may not be uniform but may depend, in part, on family structure and youth gender. context decades of randomized controlled trials have produced separate evidence-based treatments for depression, anxiety, and conduct problems in youth, but these treatments are not often used in clinical practice, and they produce mixed results in trials with the comorbid, complex youths seen in practice. an integrative, modular redesign may help.   objective standard/separate and modular/integrated arrangements of evidence-based treatments for depression, anxiety, and conduct problems in youth were compared with usual care treatment, with the modular design permitting a multidisorder focus and a flexible application of treatment procedures.   design randomized effectiveness trial.   setting ten outpatient clinical service organizations in massachusetts and hawaii.   participants a total of 84 community clinicians were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions for the treatment of 174 clinically referred youths who were 7 to 13 years of age (70% of these youths were boys, and 45% were white). the study was conducted during the period from january 12, 2005 to may 8, 2009.   interventions standard manual treatment (59 youths [34% of the sample]; cognitive behavioral therapy for depression, cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety, and behavioral parent training for conduct problems), modular treatment (62 youths [36%]; integrating the procedures of the 3 separate treatments), and usual care (53 youths [30%]).   main outcome measures outcomes were assessed using weekly youth and parent assessments. these assessments relied on a standardized brief problem checklist and a patient-generated top problems assessment (ie, the severity ratings on the problems that the youths and parents had identified as most important). we also conducted a standardized diagnostic assessment before and after treatment.   results mixed effects regression analyses showed that modular treatment produced significantly steeper trajectories of improvement than usual care and standard treatment on multiple brief problem checklist and top problems assessment measures. youths receiving modular treatment also had significantly fewer diagnoses than youths receiving usual care after treatment. in contrast, outcomes of standard manual treatment did not differ significantly from outcomes of usual care.   conclusions the modular approach outperformed usual care and standard evidence-based treatments on multiple clinical outcome measures. the modular approach may be a promising way to build on the strengths of evidence-based treatments, improving their utility and effectiveness with referred youths in clinical practice settings. trial registration  clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct01178554.
introductionwhile allowing the greatest range of axial rotation of the entire spine with 40° to each side, gradual restraint at the extremes of motion by the alar ligaments is of vital importance. in order for the ligaments to facilitate a gradual transition from the neutral to the elastic zone, a complex interaction of axial rotation and vertical translation via the biconvex articular surfaces is essential. the aim of this investigation is to establish a geometrical model of the intricate interaction of the alar ligaments and vertical translatory motion of c1/c2 in axial rotation.methodsbilateral alar ligaments including the odontoid process and condylar bony entheses were removed from six adult cadavers aged 65–89 years within 48 h of death. all specimens were judged to be free of abnormalities with the exception of non-specific degenerative changes. dimensions of the odontoid process and alar ligaments were measured. graphical multiplanar reconstruction of atlanto-axial rotation was done in the transverse and frontal planes for the neutral position and for rotation to 40° with vertical translation of 3 mm. the necessary fibre elongation of the alar ligaments in the setting with and without vertical translation of the atlas was calculated.resultsthe mean diameter of the odontoid process in the sagittal plane was 10.6 mm (sd 1.1). the longest fibre length was measured from the posterior border of the odontoid enthesis to the posterior border of the condylar enthesis with an average of 13.2 mm (sd 2.5) and the shortest between the lateral (anterior) border odontoid enthesis and the anterior condylar enthesis with an average of 8.2 mm (sd 2.2). in graphical multiplanar reconstruction of atlanto-axial rotation to 40° without vertical translation of c1/c2, theoretical alar fibre elongation reaches 27.1% for the longest fibres, which is incompatible with the collagenous structure of the alar ligaments. allowing 3 mm caudal translation of c1 on c2 at 40° rotation, as facilitated by the biconvex atlanto-axial joints, reduces alar fibre elongation to 23.3%.conclusionthe biconvex configuration of the atlanto-axial joints is an integral feature of the functionality of upper cervical spine as it allows gradual vertical translation of the atlas against the axis during axial rotation, with gradual tensing of the alar ligaments. vertical translation on its own, however, does not explain the tolerance of the alar ligaments towards the maximum of 40° of rotation and is most likely synergistic with the effects of the coupled motion of occipitocervical extension during rotation. rheumatoid arthritis frequently contributes to instability of the upper cervical spine. rotational instability of the upper cervical spine was evaluated in rheumatoid arthritis patients using biplanar x-ray photogrammetry. three-dimensional cervical motion and the instantaneous axis of rotation of the atlas relative to the axis were evaluated in normal and rheumatoid arthritis patients during axial rotation in the horizontal plane. anterior atlantoaxial subluxation did not increase during axial head rotation in either the atlantoaxial subluxation or the vertical subluxation groups, while the instantaneous axes of rotation were distributed posteriorly in the dens in the ra-normal group, but were widely scattered in the atlantoaxial subluxation group.
human mammary glands arise from multipotent progenitor cells, which likely respond both to cell-autonomous and to extrinsic cues. however, the identity of these cues and how they might act remain unclear. we analyzed her1 ligand effects on mammary morphogenesis using a three-dimensional organoid model generated from human breast tissue that recapitulates both qualitatively and quantitatively the normal ductal network in situ. strikingly, different her1 ligands generate distinct patterns of cell fate. epidermal growth factor (egf) causes a massive expansion of the myoepithelial lineage. amphiregulin, in contrast, enables normal ductal development. these differences cannot be ascribed to preferential apoptosis or proliferation of differentiated cell populations, but are dependent on her1 signal intensity. inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (erk1/2) effector rsk prevents the egf-induced myoepithelial expansion. notably, mouse mammary organoids are much less responsive to her1 ligands. little is known about the myoepithelial lineage or about growth factor effects on mammary progenitor differentiation, and our studies provide an important window into human mammary development that reveals unexpected differences from the mouse model. hepatocyte growth factor (hgf) and egf have been reported to promote branching morphogenesis of mammary epithelial cells. we now show that it is epimorphin that is primarily responsible for this phenomenon. in vivo, epimorphin was detected in the stromal compartment but not in lumenal epithelial cells of the mammary gland; in culture, however, a subpopulation of mammary epithelial cells produced significant amounts of epimorphin. when epimorphin-expressing epithelial cell clones were cultured in collagen gels they displayed branching morphogenesis in the presence of hgf, egf, keratinocyte growth factor, or fibroblast growth factor, a process that was inhibited by anti-epimorphin but not anti-hgf antibodies. the branch length, however, was roughly proportional to the ability of the factors to induce growth. accordingly, epimorphin-negative epithelial cells simply grew in a cluster in response to the growth factors and failed to branch. when recombinant epimorphin was added to these collagen gels, epimorphin-negative cells underwent branching morphogenesis. the mode of action of epimorphin on morphogenesis of the gland, however, was dependent on how it was presented to the mammary cells. if epimorphin was overexpressed in epimorphin-negative epithelial cells under regulation of an inducible promoter or was allowed to coat the surface of each epithelial cell in a nonpolar fashion, the cells formed globular, alveoli-like structures with a large central lumen instead of branching ducts. this process was enhanced also by addition of hgf, egf, or other growth factors and was inhibited by epimorphin antibodies. these results suggest that epimorphin is the primary morphogen in the mammary gland but that growth factors are necessary to achieve the appropriate cell numbers for the resulting morphogenesis to be visualized.
rat pluripotent stem cells, embryonic stem cells (escs), and induced pluripotent stem cells (ipscs) as mouse and human ones have a great potential for studying mammalian early development, disease modeling, and evaluation of regenerative medicine approaches. however, data on pluripotency realization and self-renewal maintenance in rat cells are still very limited, and differentiation protocols of rat escs (rescs) and ipscs to study development and obtain specific cell types for biomedical applications are poorly developed. in this study, the rna-seq technique was first used for detailed transcriptome characterization in rat pluripotent cells. the resc and ipsc transcriptomes demonstrated a high similarity and were significantly different from those in differentiated cells. additionally, we have shown that reprogramming of rat somatic cells to a pluripotent state was accompanied by x-chromosome reactivation. there were two active x chromosomes in xx rescs and ipscs, which is one of the key attributes of the pluripotent state. differentiation of both rescs and ipscs led to x-chromosome inactivation (xci). the dynamics of xci in differentiating rat cells was very similar to that in mice. two types of facultative heterochromatin described in various mammalian species were revealed on the rat inactive x chromosome. to explore xci dynamics, we established a new monolayer differentiation protocol for rescs and ipscs that may be applied to study different biological processes and optimized for directed derivation of specific cell types. rats have important advantages over mice as an experimental system for physiological and pharmacological investigations. the lack of rat embryonic stem (es) cells has restricted the availability of transgenic technologies to create genetic models in this species. here, we show that rat es cells can be efficiently derived, propagated, and genetically manipulated in the presence of small molecules that specifically inhibit gsk3, mek, and fgf receptor tyrosine kinases. these rat es cells express pluripotency markers and retain the capacity to differentiate into derivatives of all three germ layers. most importantly, they can produce high rates of chimerism when reintroduced into early stage embryos and can transmit through the germline. establishment of authentic rat es cells will make possible sophisticated genetic manipulation to create models for the study of human diseases.
l4 and l22, proteins of the large ribosomal subunit, contain globular surface domains and elongated ‘tentacles’ that reach into the core of the large subunit to form part of the lining of the peptide exit tunnel. mutations in the tentacles of l4 and l22 confer macrolide resistance in a variety of pathogenic and non‐pathogenic bacteria. in escherichia coli, a lys‐to‐glu mutation in l4 and a three‐amino‐acid deletion in the l22 had been reported. to learn more about the roles of the tentacles in ribosome assembly and function, we isolated additional erythromycin‐resistant e. coli mutants. eight new mutations mapped in l4, all within the tentacle. two new mutations were identified in l22; one mapped outside the tentacle. insertion mutations were found in both genes. all of the mutants grew slower than the parent, and they all showed reduced in vivo rates of peptide‐chain elongation and increased levels of precursor 23s rrna. large insertions in l4 and l22 resulted in very slow growth and accumulation of abnormal ribosomal subunits. our results highlight the important role of l4 and l22 in ribosome function and assembly, and indicate that a variety of changes in these proteins can mediate macrolide resistance. using lacl-z fusion strains of escherichia coli we have devised systems that detect deletions of varying lengths. we examined deletions 700-1000 base pairs long, and genetically characterized over 250 spontaneous deletions. of these, we analyzed 24 by direct dna sequencing and 18 by inspection of restriction fragment patterns. deletions of this size occur almost exclusively at short repeated sequences in both (reca+ and reca- strain backgrounds, but are detected 25-fold more frequently in a reca+ background. the frequency of deletion formation correlates with the extent of homology between the short repeated sequences, although other factors may be involved. the largest hotspot, which accounts for 60% of the deletions detected, involves the largest homology in the system (14 of 17 base pairs). altering a single base pair within this homology reduces deletion incidence by an order of magnitude. we discuss possible mechanisms of deletion formation and consider its relationship to the excision of transposable elements.
short tandem repeats (strs) are highly mutable genetic elements that often reside in regulatory and coding dna. the cumulative evidence of genetic studies on individual strs suggests that str variation profoundly affects phenotype and contributes to trait heritability. despite recent advances in sequencing technology, str variation has remained largely inaccessible across many individuals compared to single nucleotide variation or copy number variation. str genotyping with short-read sequence data is confounded by (1) the difficulty of uniquely mapping short, low-complexity reads; and (2) the high rate of str amplification stutter. here, we present mipstr, a robust, scalable, and affordable method that addresses these challenges. mipstr uses targeted capture of str loci by single-molecule molecular inversion probes (smmips) and a unique mapping strategy. targeted capture and our mapping strategy resolve the first challenge; the use of single molecule information resolves the second challenge. unlike previous methods, mipstr is capable of distinguishing technical error due to amplification stutter from somatic str mutations. in proof-of-principle experiments, we use mipstr to determine germline str genotypes for 102 str loci with high accuracy across diverse populations of the plant a. thaliana. we show that putatively functional strs may be identified by deviation from predicted str variation and by association with quantitative phenotypes. using dna mixing experiments and a mutant deficient in dna repair, we demonstrate that mipstr can detect low-frequency somatic str variants. mipstr is applicable to any organism with a high-quality reference genome and is scalable to genotyping many thousands of str loci in thousands of individuals. motivation in the past few years, human genome structural variation discovery has enjoyed increased attention from the genomics research community. many studies were published to characterize short insertions, deletions, duplications and inversions, and associate copy number variants (cnvs) with disease. detection of new sequence insertions requires sequence data, however, the 'detectable' sequence length with read-pair analysis is limited by the insert size. thus, longer sequence insertions that contribute to our genetic makeup are not extensively researched.   results we present novelseq: a computational framework to discover the content and location of long novel sequence insertions using paired-end sequencing data generated by the next-generation sequencing platforms. our framework can be built as part of a general sequence analysis pipeline to discover multiple types of genetic variation (snps, structural variation, etc.), thus it requires significantly less-computational resources than de novo sequence assembly. we apply our methods to detect novel sequence insertions in the genome of an anonymous donor and validate our results by comparing with the insertions discovered in the same genome using various sources of sequence data.   availability the implementation of the novelseq pipeline is available at http://compbio.cs.sfu.ca/strvar.htm   contact eee@gs.washington.edu; cenk@cs.sfu.ca
haileyesus getahun and colleagues report the development of a simple, standardized tuberculosis (tb) screening rule for resource-constrained settings, to identify people living with hiv who need further investigation for tb disease. rationale gold miners in south africa undergo annual radiological screening for tuberculosis in an occupational health center of a gold mining company, but the optimal screening algorithm is unclear.   objectives to evaluate methods for active case detection of tuberculosis.   methods a sequential sample of miners attending annual medical examination was screened for tuberculosis using a symptom questionnaire, chest radiograph, and two sputum specimens for microscopy and culture.   measurements and main results there were 1,955 miners included in this study; all were male with a median age of 41 years (range, 20-61 yr). presence of at least one of a trio of symptoms (new or worsening cough, night sweats, or weight loss) had similar sensitivity (29.4%) to either chest radiograph (25.5%) or sputum smear (25.5%). these sensitivities did not differ by hiv status. presence of one or more elements of the symptom trio and/or new radiological abnormality substantially increased sensitivity to 49.0%. specificity of the symptom trio was higher in hiv-uninfected (91.8%) than in hiv-infected persons (88.2%; p = 0.018). specificity of chest radiography and smear were similar (98.7% and 99.0%, respectively) and did not differ by hiv status (both p values > 0.8).   conclusions in a population of gold miners who undergo regular radiological screening, the addition of chest radiography to symptom screening substantially improved the sensitivity and positive predictive value. hiv infection did not alter the sensitivity of the screening tool.
if good intentions pave the road to hell, what paves the road to heaven? we propose that moral judgments are based, in part, on the degree of effort exerted in performing the immoral or moral act. because effort can serve as an index of goal importance, greater effort in performing immoral acts would lead to more negative judgments, whereas greater effort in performing moral acts would lead to more positive judgments. in support of these ideas, we found that perceived effort intensified judgments of both immoral (studies 1-2) and moral (studies 2-7) agents. the effect of effort on judgment was independent of the outcome (study 3) and of perceptions of the outcome extremity (study 6). furthermore, the effect of effort on judgment was mediated by perceived goal importance (studies 4-6), even when controlling for perceived intentions (studies 5-6). finally, we demonstrate that perceived effort can influence actual behavior, such as the assignment of monetary rewards (study 7). we discuss the possible implications of effort as a causal motivational factor in moral judgment and social retribution. (psycinfo database record people and societies seek to combat harmful events. however, because resources are limited, every wrong righted leaves another wrong left unchecked. responses must therefore be calibrated to the magnitude of the harm. one underappreciated factor that affects this calibration may be people’s oversensitivity to intent. across a series of studies, people saw intended harms as worse than unintended harms, even though the two harms were identical. this harm-magnification effect occurred for both subjective and monetary estimates of harm, and it remained when participants were given incentives to be accurate. the effect was fully mediated by blame motivation. people may therefore focus on intentional harms to the neglect of unintentional (but equally damaging) harms.
background advances in pain assessment approaches now indicate which measures should be used to capture chronic pain experiences in children and adolescents. however, there is little guidance on how these tools should best be administered and reported, such as which time frames to use or how pain scores are categorised as mild, moderate, or severe. objective to synthesise current evidence on unidimensional, single-item pain intensity scale selection, administration, interpretation, and reporting. methods databases were searched (inception: 18 january 2016) for studies in which unidimensional pain intensity assessments were used with children and adolescents with chronic pain. ten quality criteria were developed by modifying existing recommendations to evaluate the quality of administration of pain scales most commonly used with children. results forty-six studies met the inclusion criteria. the highest score achieved was 7 out of a possible 10 (median: 5; iqr: 4–6). usage of scales varied markedly in administrator/completer, highest anchors, number of successive assessments, and time referent periods used. conclusions findings suggest these scales are selected, administered, and interpreted inconsistently, even in studies of the same type. furthermore, methods of administration are rarely reported or justified making it impossible to compare findings across studies. this article concludes by recommending criteria for the future reporting of paediatric chronic pain assessments in studies. unlabelled a number of adolescents with chronic pain have clinically significant disability across physical, social, and academic activities, and pain severity only explains a portion of the variance in functioning. thus, it is important to identify therapeutic options to improve adolescents' functioning. in contrast to studies with adults with chronic pain, research in pediatric pain has not consistently found anxiety to be a good predictor of pain-related disability. the present study evaluated pain, anxiety, and functioning in 222 adolescents with chronic pain. results indicated that pain was consistently and linearly related to disability across measures of physical and social functioning, school attendance, and physician visits. the relation between anxiety and functioning was complex; increased anxiety was related to poorer physical and social functioning and was related to fewer physician visits, although it was not associated with school attendance. additional analyses revealed that anxiety serves to moderate the relation between pain and functioning. specifically, at high anxiety, pain was not related to functioning, but at low anxiety, pain consistently predicted disability. in other words, highly anxious adolescents were functioning poorly regardless of the level of pain. the moderating role of anxiety highlights a number of research and clinical possibilities to explore with adolescents with chronic pain-related disability.   perspective data suggest that high anxiety is associated with poor functioning irrespective of pain intensity. at low anxiety, higher pain predicted greater disability. anxiety is important to assess when investigating potential reasons for pain-related disability.
convolutional neural networks have demonstrated high accuracy on various tasks in recent years. however, they are extremely vulnerable to adversarial examples. for example, imperceptible perturbations added to clean images can cause convolutional neural networks to fail. in this paper, we propose to utilize randomization at inference time to mitigate adversarial effects. specifically, we use two randomization operations: random resizing, which resizes the input images to a random size, and random padding, which pads zeros around the input images in a random manner. extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed randomization method is very effective at defending against both single-step and iterative attacks. our method provides the following advantages: 1) no additional training or fine-tuning, 2) very few additional computations, 3) compatible with other adversarial defense methods. by combining the proposed randomization method with an adversarially trained model, it achieves a normalized score of 0.924 (ranked no.2 among 107 defense teams) in the nips 2017 adversarial examples defense challenge, which is far better than using adversarial training alone with a normalized score of 0.773 (ranked no.56). the code is public available at this https url. very deep convolutional networks have been central to the largest advances in image recognition performance in recent years. one example is the inception architecture that has been shown to achieve very good performance at relatively low computational cost. recently, the introduction of residual connections in conjunction with a more traditional architecture has yielded state-of-the-art performance in the 2015 ilsvrc challenge; its performance was similar to the latest generation inception-v3 network. this raises the question of whether there are any benefit in combining the inception architecture with residual connections. here we give clear empirical evidence that training with residual connections accelerates the training of inception networks significantly. there is also some evidence of residual inception networks outperforming similarly expensive inception networks without residual connections by a thin margin. we also present several new streamlined architectures for both residual and non-residual inception networks. these variations improve the single-frame recognition performance on the ilsvrc 2012 classification task significantly. we further demonstrate how proper activation scaling stabilizes the training of very wide residual inception networks. with an ensemble of three residual and one inception-v4, we achieve 3.08 percent top-5 error on the test set of the imagenet classification (cls) challenge
the purpose of this article is to provide a summary of the initial, published results of a large, prospective, population-based cohort study of children with structural congenital heart defects in france. we also discuss the current and future work to be done in this study aims to estimate the risk of congenital heart defects (chd) associated with assisted reproductive technologies (art).   methods and results we used data from the paris registry of congenital malformations on 5493 cases of chd and 3847 malformed controls for which no associations with art were reported in the literature. assisted reproductive technologies included inductors of ovulation only, in vitro fertilization, and intracytoplasmic sperm injection. exposure to art was higher for cases than controls (4.7 vs. 3.6%, p= 0.008) and was associated with a 40% increase in the maternal age, socioeconomic factors, and year of birth-adjusted odds of chd without chromosomal abnormalities [adjusted odds ratio (or) 1.4, 95% confidence interval (ci) 1.1-1.7]. assisted reproductive technologies were specifically associated with significant increases in the odds of malformations of the outflow tracts and ventriculoarterial connections (adjusted or 1.7, 95% ci 1.2-2.4) and of cardiac neural crest defects and double outlet right ventricle (adjusted or 1.7, 95% ci 1.1-2.7). in general, we found specific associations between methods of art and subcategories of chd.   conclusion cases with chd were more likely to have been conceived following art when compared with malformed controls. this higher risk for chd varied specifically according to the method of art and the type of chd and may be due to art per se and/or the underlying infertility of couples.
to compare gastrointestinal (gi) problems among children with: (1) autism spectrum disorder (asd), (2) developmental delay (dd) and (3) typical development (td), gi symptom frequencies were obtained for 960 children from the childhood autism risks from genetics and environment (charge) study. we also examined scores on five aberrant behavior checklist (abc) subscales comparing asd children with high versus low frequency gi symptoms. compared to td children, those with asd [aor 7.92 (4.89–12.85)] and dd [aor 4.55 (2.51–8.24)] were more likely to have at least one frequent gi symptom. restricting to asd children, those with frequent abdominal pain, gaseousness, diarrhea, constipation or pain on stooling scored worse on irritability, social withdrawal, stereotypy, and hyperactivity compared with children having no frequent gi symptoms. frequent gi problems affect young children with asd and dd more commonly than those with td. maladaptive behaviors correlate with gi problems, suggesting these comorbidities require attention. diagnoses for autism based on the autism diagnostic interview-revised (adi-r) and the childhood autism rating scale (cars) were examined for 83 individuals with suspected autism. agreement between systems reached 85.7%. participants receiving diagnosis of autism based on only one system were significantly younger in age than individuals receiving diagnoses according to both systems. individuals who did not receive diagnosis of autism on the adi-r had lower chronological and mental ages and lower cars scores compared to individuals who received diagnosis of autism based on the adi-r. eighteen females and 18 males were matched to examine possible gender differences. no significant findings were revealed, suggesting that the symptoms of autism according to the adi-r and cars do not differ between males and females when matched for chronological and mental ages.
in the past, evolved virtual creatures (evcs) have been developed with rigid, articulated bodies, and with soft bodies, but never before with a combination of the two. in nature, however, creatures combining a rigid skeleton and non-rigid muscles are some of the most complex and successful examples of life on earth. now, for the first time, creatures with fully evolved rigid-body skeletons and soft-body muscles can be developed in the virtual world, as well. by exploiting and re-purposing the capabilities of existing soft-body simulation systems, we can evolve complex and effective simulated muscles, able to drive a rigid-body skeleton. in this way, we can begin to bridge the gap between articulated and softbodied evcs, and take the next step on a nature-inspired path to meaningful morphological complexity for evolved virtual creatures. this article describes a system for the evolution and coevolution of virtual creatures that compete in physically simulated three-dimensional worlds. pairs of individuals enter one-on-one contests in which they contend to gain control of a common resource. the winners receive higher relative fitness scores allowing them to survive and reproduce. realistic dynamics simulation including gravity, collisions, and friction, restricts the actions to physically plausible behaviors. the morphology of these creatures and the neural systems for controlling their muscle forces are both genetically determined, and the morphology and behavior can adapt to each other as they evolve simultaneously. the genotypes are structured as directed graphs of nodes and connections, and they can efficiently but flexibly describe instructions for the development of creatures' bodies and control systems with repeating or recursive components. when simulated evolutions are performed with populations of competing creatures, interesting and diverse strategies and counterstrategies emerge.
recent advances in sequencing and metagenomics have enabled the discovery of many novel single stranded dna (ssdna) viruses from various environments. we have previously demonstrated that adult dragonflies, as predatory insects, are useful indicators of ssdna viruses in terrestrial ecosystems. here we recover and characterise 13 viral genomes which represent 10 novel and diverse circular replication associated protein (rep)-encoding single stranded (cress) dna viruses (1628-2668nt) from procordulia grayi and xanthocnemis zealandica dragonfly larvae collected from four high-country lakes in the south island of new zealand. the dragonfly larvae associated cress dna viruses have different genome architectures, however, they all encode two major open reading frames (orfs) which either have bidirectional or unidirectional arrangement. the 13 viral genomes have a conserved nagtattac nonanucleotide motif and in their predicted rep proteins we identified the rolling circle replication (rcr) motif 1, 2 and 3, as well as superfamily 3 (sf3) helicase motifs. maximum likelihood phylogenetic and pairwise identity analysis of the rep amino acid sequences reveal that the dragonfly larvae novel cress dna viruses share <63% pairwise amino acid identity to the reps of other cress dna viruses whose complete genomes have been determined and available in public databases and that these viruses are novel. cress dna viruses are circulating in larval dragonfly populations; however, we are unable to ascertain whether these viruses are infecting the larvae directly or are transient within dragonflies via their diet. unlabelled we have implemented a high-performance computing (hpc) version of prottest that can be executed in parallel in multicore desktops and clusters. this version, called prottest 3, includes new features and extended capabilities.   availability prottest 3 source code and binaries are freely available under gnu license for download from http://darwin.uvigo.es/software/prottest3, linked to a mercurial repository at bitbucket (https://bitbucket.org/).   contact dposada@uvigo.es   supplementary information supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.
our recent work has suggested that the nitric oxide/guanosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate (no/cgmp) signal transduction system contributes to central sensitization of spinothalamic tract (stt) neurons in part by influencing the descending inhibition of nociception resulting from stimulation in the periaqueductal gray. this study was designed to examine further whether activation of the no/cgmp cascade reduces the inhibition of the activity of stt neurons mediated by spinal inhibitory amino acid (iaa) receptors. responses of stt cells to noxious cutaneous stimuli were inhibited by iontophoresis of glycine and gaba agonists in anesthetized monkeys. administration of 8-bromoguanosine-3',5'-cyclophosphate sodium (8-bromo-cgmp), a membrane permeable analogue of cgmp, either by microdialysis or by iontophoresis reduced significantly the iaa-induced inhibition of wide dynamic range (wdr) stt cells in the deep layers of the dorsal horn. the reduction in inhibition lasted for up to 1-1.5 h after the cessation of drug infusion. in contrast, iaa-induced inhibition of wdr stt cells in the superficial dorsal horn and high-threshold (ht) cells in superficial or deep layers was not significantly changed during 8-bromo-cgmp infusion. iontophoresis of 8-bromo-cgmp onto stt cells produced the same actions as produced by microdialysis of this agent, but the effect was not as long-lasting nor as potent. finally, an attenuation of the iaa receptor-mediated inhibition of stt cells produced by iontophoretic release of a no donor, 3-morpholinosydnonimine, could be blocked by pretreatment of the spinal cord with a guanylate cyclase inhibitor, 1h-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one. these results suggest that an increased spinal cgmp level contributes to the sensitization of wdr stt neurons in the deep dorsal horn in part by down-regulating spinal iaa receptors. however, no evidence is provided in this study that the no/cgmp cascade regulates iaa receptors on ht and superficial wdr neurons. combined with the preceding studies, our data support the view that no and cgmp function in the same signal transduction cascade and play an important role in central sensitization. the responsiveness of spinal cord nociceptive neurons to innocuous mechanical stimuli can be increased by the release of excitatory amino acids (eaas) and peptides attributable to an injury-induced barrage of impulses. this sensitization of spinal dorsal horn neurons can also result from administration of phorbol ester by microdialysis, presumably by direct activation of protein kinase c (pkc). this study was designed to examine the effects of central sensitization of spinothalamic tract (stt) neurons produced by intradermal injection of capsaicin on the descending inhibition driven from the periaqueductal gray (pag) and the possible role of pkc in this process in anesthetized monkeys. sensitization of responses of stt cells to mechanical stimuli was induced by intradermal injection of capsaicin. pag inhibition was significantly attenuated when sensitization of responses to mechanical stimuli occurred. however, perfusion of the spinal cord with npc15437 (a selective pkc inhibitor) by microdialysis could prevent the sensitization of the responses to mechanical stimuli and the reduction in pag inhibition of these responses induced by capsaicin injection. results similar to those produced by capsaicin injection were observed when a pkc activator, phorbol ester (12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate), was infused within the dorsal horn by microdialysis. an inactive phorbol ester (4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate) had no effect. these results provide evidence that the activation of pkc contributes to the development of central sensitization in dorsal horn neurons produced by chemical stimulation with capsaicin. attenuation of the effectiveness of pag inhibition takes place when the sensitization of dorsal horn cells develops, and pkc may play a significant role in this process.
backgroundpreterm infants in neonatal intensive care units frequently receive red blood cells (rbc) transfusions due to the anemia of prematurity. a number of variables related to gestational age, severity of illness and transfusion practices adopted in the neonatal unit where the neonate was born may contribute to the prescription of rbc transfusions. this study aimed to analyse the frequency and factors associated with rbc transfusions in very-low-birth-weight preterm infants.methodsa prospective cohort of 4283 preterm infants (gestational age: 29.9 ± 2.9 weeks; birth weight: 1084 ± 275 g) carried out at 16 university hospitals in brazil between january 2009 and december 2011 was analysed. factors associated with rbc transfusions were evaluated using univariate and multiple logistic regression analysis.resultsa total of 2208 (51.6 %) infants received rbc transfusions (variation per neonatal unit: 34.1 % to 66.4 %). rbc transfusions were significantly associated with gestational age (or: -1.098; 95%ci: -1.12 to -1.04), snappe ii score (1.01; 1.00-1.02), apnea (1.69; 1.34-2.14), pulmonary hemorrhage (2.65; 1.74-4.031), need for oxygen at 28 days of life (1.56; 1.17-2.08), clinical sepsis (3.22; 2.55-4.05), necrotising enterocolitis (3.80; 2.26-6.41), grades iii/iv intraventricular hemorrhage (1.64; 1.05-2.58), mechanical ventilation (2.27; 1.74-2.97), use of umbilical catheter (1.86; 1.35-2.57), parenteral nutrition (2.06; 1.27-3.33), >60 days of hospitalization (5.29; 4.02-6.95) and the neonatal unit where the neonate was born.conclusionsthe frequency of rbc transfusions varied among neonatal intensive care units. even after adjusting for adverse health conditions and therapeutic interventions, the neonatal unit continued to influence transfusion practices in very-low birth-weight infants. bronchopulmonary dysplasia has become the most common pulmonary sequelae in neonates receiving mechanical ventilation. the pathogenesis of bpd is multifactorial, but prematurity, positive pressure ventilation, oxygen toxicity and pulmonary edema are some of the most important factors in its development. by minimizing these factors, it is possible to reduce the incidence and severity of bpd.
the aim of this study was to elucidate the underlying biochemical processes to identify potential key molecules of meat quality traits drip loss, ph of meat 1 h post-mortem (ph1), ph in meat 24 h post-mortem (ph24) and meat color. an untargeted metabolomics approach detected the profiles of 393 annotated and 1,600 unknown metabolites in 97 duroc × pietrain pigs. despite obvious differences regarding the statistical approaches, the four applied methods, namely correlation analysis, principal component analysis, weighted network analysis (wna) and random forest regression (rfr), revealed mainly concordant results. our findings lead to the conclusion that meat quality traits ph1, ph24 and color are strongly influenced by processes of post-mortem energy metabolism like glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway, whereas drip loss is significantly associated with metabolites of lipid metabolism. in case of drip loss, rfr was the most suitable method to identify reliable biomarkers and to predict the phenotype based on metabolites. on the other hand, wna provides the best parameters to investigate the metabolite interactions and to clarify the complex molecular background of meat quality traits. in summary, it was possible to attain findings on the interaction of meat quality traits and their underlying biochemical processes. the detected key metabolites might be better indicators of meat quality especially of drip loss than the measured phenotype itself and potentially might be used as bio indicators. background advances in “omics” technologies have revolutionized the collection of biological data. a matching revolution in our understanding of biological systems, however, will only be realized when similar advances are made in informatic analysis of the resulting “big data.” here, we compare the capabilities of three conventional and novel statistical approaches to summarize and decipher the tomato metabolome. methodology principal component analysis (pca), batch learning self-organizing maps (bl-som) and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (wgcna) were applied to a multivariate nmr dataset collected from developmentally staged tomato fruits belonging to several genotypes. while pca and bl-som are appropriate and commonly used methods, wgcna holds several advantages in the analysis of highly multivariate, complex data. conclusions pca separated the two major genetic backgrounds (ac and nc), but provided little further information. both bl-som and wgcna clustered metabolites by expression, but wgcna additionally defined “modules” of co-expressed metabolites explicitly and provided additional network statistics that described the systems properties of the tomato metabolic network. our first application of wgcna to tomato metabolomics data identified three major modules of metabolites that were associated with ripening-related traits and genetic background.
we cast sentence boundary detection and syntactic parsing as a joint problem, so an entire text document forms a training instance for transition-based dependency parsing. when trained with an early update or max-violation strategy for inexact search, we observe that only a tiny part of these very long training instances is ever exploited. we demonstrate this effect by extending the arcstandard transition system with swap for the joint prediction task. when we use an alternative update strategy, our models are considerably better on both tasks and train in substantially less time compared to models trained with early update/max-violation. a comparison between a standard pipeline and our joint model furthermore empirically shows the usefulness of syntactic information on the task of sentence boundary detection. training higher-order conditional random fields is prohibitive for huge tag sets. we present an approximated conditional random field using coarse-to-fine decoding and early updating. we show that our implementation yields fast and accurate morphological taggers across six languages with different morphological properties and that across languages higher-order models give significant improvements over 1-order models.
we assessed postural body sway performance after exposure to movement induced time‐varying magnetic fields in the static magnetic stray field in front of a 7 tesla (t) magnetic resonance imaging scanner. using a double blind randomized crossover design, 30 healthy volunteers performed two balance tasks (i.e., standing with eyes closed and feet in parallel and then in tandem position) after standardized head movements in a sham, low exposure (on average 0.24 t static magnetic stray field and 0.49 t·s−1 time‐varying magnetic field) and high exposure condition (0.37 t and 0.70 t·s−1). personal exposure to static magnetic stray fields and time‐varying magnetic fields was measured with a personal dosimeter. postural body sway was expressed in sway path, area, and velocity. mixed‐effects model regression analysis showed that postural body sway in the parallel task was negatively affected (p < 0.05) by exposure on all three measures. the tandem task revealed the same trend, but did not reach statistical significance. further studies are needed to investigate the possibility of independent or synergetic effects of static magnetic stray field and time‐varying magnetic field exposure. in addition, practical safety implications of these findings, e.g., for surgeons and others working near magnetic resonance imaging scanners need to be investigated. magn reson med, 2013. © 2012 wiley periodicals, inc. there are concerns about workers repeatedly exposed to magnetic fields exceeding regulatory limits with respect to modern magnetic resonance imaging (mri). as a result, there is need for an ambulatory magnetic field dosimeter capable of measuring these fields in and around an mri scanner in order to evaluate the regulatory guidelines and determine any underlying exposure risks. this study presents results of tri-axial measurements using an ambulatory magnetic field dosimeter worn by workers during normal working shifts. we recorded and analyzed magnetic field exposures in and around 1.5 t, 2 t, and 4 t magnets during routine patient procedures. the data was integrated and averaged over time and evaluated against the latest exposure standards. time-varying magnetic fields occur when individuals move through spatially non-uniform static magnetic fields or during gradient-pulsed magnetic fields or a combination of both. our previous numerical analysis shows that at certain positions surrounding the mri scanner ends, such fields may induce current densities and electric fields that may exceed the relevant eu, icnirp, and ieee standards. a high-speed acquisition version of the dosimeter measured gradient-pulsed fields at positions accessible by mri workers near the scanner ends, and the results were evaluated and compared against the numerical simulations and the standards. our measurements confirm that workers can be exposed to magnetic fields exceeding the guidelines at positions near the gradient coil ends during clinical imaging and a high degree of correlation exists with the numerical results. while the time-weighted average magnetic field exposures in 1.5 t, 2 t, and 4 t were all within the regulatory limits during static magnetic field measurements, the peak limits for the head can be exceeded in some circumstances. this study presents a small number of routine shifts of data that provide indicative results of magnetic field exposure in real situations.
pigs can be severely harmed by influenza, and represent important reservoir hosts, in which new human pathogens such as the recent pandemic swine-origin h1n1 influenza a virus can arise by mutation and reassortment of genome segments. to obtain novel, safe influenza vaccines for pigs, and to investigate the antigen-specific immune response, we modified an established live-virus vaccine against aujeszky's disease of swine, pseudorabies virus (prv) strain bartha (prv-ba), to serve as vector for the expression of haemagglutinin (ha) of swine-origin h1n1 virus. to facilitate transgene insertion, the genome of prv-ba was cloned as a bacterial artificial chromosome. ha expression occurred under control of the human or murine cytomegalovirus immediate early promoters (p-hcmv, p-mcmv), but could be substantially enhanced by synthetic introns and adaptation of the codon usage to that of prv. however, despite abundant expression, the heterologous glycoprotein was not detectably incorporated into mature prv particles. replication of ha-expressing prv in cell culture was only slightly affected compared to that of the parental virus strain. a single immunization of pigs with the prv vector expressing the codon-optimized ha gene under control of p-mcmv induced high levels of ha-specific antibodies. the vaccinated animals were protected from clinical signs after challenge with a related swine-origin h1n1 influenza a virus, and challenge virus shedding was significantly reduced. attenuated vaccine strains of the alphaherpesvirus causing infectious laryngotracheitis of chickens (iltv, gallid herpesvirus 1) can be used for mass application. previously, we showed that live virus vaccination with recombinant iltv expressing hemagglutinin of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (hpaiv) protected chickens against ilt and fowl plague caused by hpaiv carrying the corresponding hemagglutinin subtypes [lüschow d, werner o, mettenleiter tc, fuchs w. protection of chickens from lethal avian influenza a virus infection by live-virus vaccination with infectious laryngotracheitis virus recombinants expressing the hemagglutinin (h5) gene. vaccine 2001;19(30):4249-59; veits j, lüschow d, kindermann k, werner o, teifke jp, mettenleiter tc, et al. deletion of the non-essential ul0 gene of infectious laryngotracheitis (ilt) virus leads to attenuation in chickens, and ul0 mutants expressing influenza virus haemagglutinin (h7) protect against ilt and fowl plague. j gen virol 2003;84(12):3343-52]. however, protection against h5n1 hpaiv was not satisfactory. therefore, a newly designed dutpase-negative iltv vector was used for rapid insertion of the h5-hemagglutinin, or n1-neuraminidase genes of a recent h5n1 hpaiv isolate. compared to our previous constructs, protein expression was considerably enhanced by insertion of synthetic introns downstream of the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter within the 5'-nontranslated region of the transgenes. deletion of the viral dutpase gene did not affect in vitro replication of the iltv recombinants, but led to sufficient attenuation in vivo. after a single ocular immunization, all chickens developed h5- or n1-specific serum antibodies. nevertheless, animals immunized with n1-iltv died after subsequent h5n1 hpaiv challenge, although survival times were prolonged compared to non-vaccinated controls. in contrast, all chickens vaccinated with either h5-iltv alone, or h5- and n1-iltv simultaneously, survived without showing any clinical signs. real-time rt-pcr indicated limited challenge virus replication after vaccination with h5-iltv only, which was completely blocked after coimmunization with n1-iltv. thus, chickens can be protected from h5n1 hpaiv-induced disease by live vaccination with an attenuated hemagglutinin-expressing iltv recombinant, and efficacy can be further increased by coadministration of an iltv mutant expressing neuraminidase. furthermore, chickens vaccinated with iltv vectors can be easily differentiated from influenza virus-infected animals by the absence of serum antibodies against the aiv nucleoprotein.
the number of known nucleotide sequences encoding proteins is growing at an extraordinarily fast rate due to technologies developed in the last decade that enable rapid sequence acquisition. such rapid acquisition is a prelude to understanding the molecular function and tertiary structure of these protein sequences, and from there to an understanding of the role these proteins play in a particular organism. the experimental technologies that enable us to understand molecular function have not progressed as fast as those for sequencing. one role of computational biology is to accurately predict protein molecular function based on the protein’s sequence alone.  phylogenomics is a field of study that approaches the problem of protein molecular function prediction from an evolutionary perspective. in particular, a phylogenomic analysis transfers existing (but sparse) molecular function annotations to a query protein based on a reconciled phylogeny, which explicitly represents the evolutionary relationships of a set of related proteins. in my dissertation, i formalize the phylogenomics methodology as a statistical graphical model of molecular function evolution. within this framework, we can predict protein molecular function from protein sequence alone. molecular function evolution is represented as a simple continuous time markov chain, and the random variables at each node in the tree are a subset of functional terms from the gene ontology. the model is encapsulated in a framework called sifter (statistical inference of function through evolutionary relationships).  sifter has performed well on a number of diverse protein families, as compared to standard annotation transfer methods and other phylogenomics-based approaches. sifter has been applied to the complete genomes of 46 fungal species, and is able to make molecular function predictions for a large percentage of the predicted proteins in these genomes. moreover, through these predictions we can explore some genomic comparisons for fungi. motivated by the high cost of characterization experiments, active learning techniques have also been applied to sifter’s protein function predictions, with good results. genomic sequencing has made it clear that a large fraction of the genes specifying the core biological functions are shared by all eukaryotes. knowledge of the biological role of such shared proteins in one organism can often be transferred to other organisms. the goal of the gene ontology consortium is to produce a dynamic, controlled vocabulary that can be applied to all eukaryotes even as knowledge of gene and protein roles in cells is accumulating and changing. to this end, three independent ontologies accessible on the world-wide web (http://www.geneontology.org) are being constructed: biological process, molecular function and cellular component.
background characterizing the parasite dynamics and population structure provides useful information to understand the dynamic of transmission and to better target control interventions. despite considerable efforts for its control, vivax malaria remains a major health problem in peru. in this study, we have explored the population genetics of plasmodium vivax isolates from iquitos, the main city in the peruvian amazon, and 25 neighbouring peri-urban as well as rural villages along the iquitos-nauta road. methodology/ results from april to december 2008, 292 p. vivax isolates were collected and successfully genotyped using 14 neutral microsatellites. analysis of the molecular data revealed a similar proportion of monoclonal and polyclonal infections in urban areas, while in rural areas monoclonal infections were predominant (p = 0.002). multiplicity of infection was higher in urban (moi = 1.5–2) compared to rural areas (moi = 1) (p = 0.003). the level of genetic diversity was similar in all areas (he = 0.66–0.76, p = 0.32) though genetic differentiation between areas was substantial (phipt = 0.17, p<0.0001). principal coordinate analysis showed a marked differentiation between parasites from urban and rural areas. linkage disequilibrium was detected in all the areas (ias = 0.08–0.49, for all p<0.0001). gene flow among the areas was stablished through bayesian analysis of migration models. recent bottleneck events were detected in 4 areas and a recent parasite expansion in one of the isolated areas. in total, 87 unique haplotypes grouped in 2 or 3 genetic clusters described a sub-structured parasite population. conclusion/significance our study shows a sub-structured parasite population with clonal propagation, with most of its components recently affected by bottleneck events. iquitos city is the main source of parasite spreading for all the peripheral study areas. the routes of transmission and gene flow and the reduction of the parasite population described are important from the public health perspective as well for the formulation of future control policies. backgroundperu is one of the latin american countries with the highest malaria burden, mainly due to plasmodium vivax infections. however, little is known about p. vivax transmission dynamics in the peruvian amazon, where most malaria cases occur. the genetic diversity and population structure of p. vivax isolates collected in different communities around iquitos city, the capital of the peruvian amazon, was determined.methodsplasmodium vivax population structure was determined by multilocus genotyping with 16 microsatellites on 159 p. vivax infected blood samples (mono-infections) collected in four sites around iquitos city. the population characteristics were assessed only in samples with monoclonal infections (n = 94), and the genetic diversity was determined by calculating the expected heterozygosity and allelic richness. both linkage disequilibrium and the genetic differentiation (θ) were estimated.resultsthe proportion of polyclonal infections varied substantially by site (11% - 70%), with the expected heterozygosity ranging between 0.44 and 0.69; no haplotypes were shared between the different populations. linkage disequilibrium was present in all populations (ias 0.14 - 0.61) but was higher in those with fewer polyclonal infections, suggesting inbreeding and a clonal population structure. strong population differentiation (θ = 0.45) was found and the bayesian inference cluster analysis identified six clusters based on distinctive allele frequencies.conclusionthe p. vivax populations circulating in the peruvian amazon basin are genetically diverse, strongly differentiated and they have a low effective recombination rate. these results are in line with the low and clustered pattern of malaria transmission observed in the region around iquitos city.
the first genome wide association study (gwas) of otitis media (om) found evidence of association in the western australian pregnancy cohort (raine) study, but lacked replication in an independent om population. the aim of this study was to investigate association at these loci in our family-based sample of chronic otitis media with effusion and recurrent otitis media (come/rom). autosomal snps were selected from the raine om gwas results. snps from the raine cohort gwas genotyped in our gwas of come/rom had p-values ranging from p = 0.06–0.80. after removal of snps previously genotyped in our gwas of come/rom (n = 21) and those that failed fluidigm assay design (n = 1), 26 snps were successfully genotyped in 716 individuals from our come/rom family population. none of the snp associations replicated in our family-based population (unadjusted p = 0.03–0.93). replication in an independent sample would confirm that these represent novel om loci, and that further investigation is warranted. otitis media (om) is the most common childhood disease. almost all children experience at least one episode, but morbidity is greatest in children who experience chronic/recurrent om (come/rom). there is mounting evidence that come/rom clusters in families and exhibits substantial heritability. subjects who had tympanostomy tube surgery for come/rom (probands) and their families were recruited for the present study, and an ear examination was performed, without knowledge of the subject's history, to determine presence of om sequelae. in addition, tympanometric testing was performed at three frequencies (226, 630 or 710, and 1,400 hz) to detect abnormal middle-ear mechanics, and hearing was screened at 20 db for the speech frequencies. of these families, 121 had at least two individuals who had received the diagnosis of come/rom (364 affected and genotyped individuals), of whom 238 affected and informative relative pairs were used for analyses. single-point nonparametric linkage analysis provided evidence of linkage of come/rom to chromosome 10q at marker d10s212 (lod 3.78; p=3.0 x 10(-5)) and to chromosome 19q at marker d19s254 (lod 2.61; p=5.3 x 10(-4)). analyses conditional on support for linkage at chromosomes 10q and 19q resulted in a significant increase in lod score support on chromosome 3p (between markers d3s4545 and d3s1259). these results suggest that risk of come/rom is determined by interactions between genes that reside in several candidate regions of the genome and are probably modulated by other environmental risk factors.
the task of obfuscating writing style using sequence models has previously been investigated under the framework of obfuscation-by-transfer, where the input text is explicitly rewritten in another style. these approaches also often lead to major alterations to the semantic content of the input. in this work, we propose obfuscation-by-invariance, and investigate to what extent models trained to be explicitly style-invariant preserve semantics. we evaluate our architectures on parallel and non-parallel corpora, and compare automatic and human evaluations on the obfuscated sentences. our experiments show that style classifier performance can be reduced to chance level, whilst the automatic evaluation of the output is seemingly equal to models applying style-transfer. however, based on human evaluation we demonstrate a trade-off between the level of obfuscation and the observed quality of the output in terms of meaning preservation and grammaticality. we present the word mover's distance (wmd), a novel distance function between text documents. our work is based on recent results in word embeddings that learn semantically meaningful representations for words from local cooccurrences in sentences. the wmd distance measures the dissimilarity between two text documents as the minimum amount of distance that the embedded words of one document need to "travel" to reach the embedded words of another document. we show that this distance metric can be cast as an instance of the earth mover's distance, a well studied transportation problem for which several highly efficient solvers have been developed. our metric has no hyperparameters and is straight-forward to implement. further, we demonstrate on eight real world document classification data sets, in comparison with seven state-of-the-art baselines, that the wmd metric leads to unprecedented low k-nearest neighbor document classification error rates.
purpose lens epithelial cell (lec) apoptosis reduces the formation of posterior capsular opacification (pco). the involvement of caveolin-1 in the regulation of apoptosis has been previously demonstrated in epithelial cells. in this study, we investigated the relationship between caveolin-1 and apoptosis of lecs under high glucose (hg) concentrations to explore a mechanism in the formation of pco in diabetic patients. methods lecs were treated with high concentrations of glucose with or without epidermal growth factor (egf) or simvastatin in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (dmem). induction of apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry, and the expression of caveolin-1 was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy, quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt–pcr), and immunoblotting. results the expression of caveolin-1 was decreased, and the rate of apoptosis was increased in lecs treated with increased glucose concentration and treatment duration. when simvastatin or egf was added to hg-treated lecs, caveolin-1 levels increased and the apoptosis rate of lecs decreased. furthermore, colocalization of caveolin-1 and phosphatidylserine (ps) on the cell surfaces of apoptotic lecs was observed by immunofluorescence microscopy. conclusions we observed that in hg-treated lecs, caveolin-1 expression decreased and apoptosis increased and that simvastatin or egf promoted the proliferation of hg-treated lecs. although the mechanisms for the formation of pco after cataract surgery in diabetic patients are complex, our results suggest that a high concentration of glucose is not a direct cause. the observation that simvastatin inhibited the apoptosis of hg-treated lecs in its therapeutic concentration suggests that daily dosage of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a (hmg-coa) reductase inhibitor used by diabetic patients may increase pco formation. gpi-linked protein molecules become triton-insoluble during polarized sorting to the apical cell surface of epithelial cells. these insoluble complexes, enriched in cholesterol, glycolipids, and gpi-linked proteins, have been isolated by flotation on sucrose density gradients and are thought to contain the putative gpi-sorting machinery. as the cellular origin and molecular protein components of this complex remain unknown, we have begun to characterize these low-density insoluble complexes isolated from mdck cells. we find that these complexes, which represent 0.4-0.8% of the plasma membrane, ultrastructurally resemble caveolae and are over 150-fold enriched in a model gpi-anchored protein and caveolin, a caveolar marker protein. however, they exclude many other plasma membrane associated molecules and organelle-specific marker enzymes, suggesting that they represent microdomains of the plasma membrane. in addition to caveolin, these insoluble complexes contain a subset of hydrophobic plasma membrane proteins and cytoplasmically-oriented signaling molecules, including: (a) gtp- binding proteins--both small and heterotrimeric; (b) annex ii--an apical calcium-regulated phospholipid binding protein with a demonstrated role in exocytic fusion events; (c) c-yes--an apically localized member of the src family of non-receptor type protein- tyrosine kinases; and (d) an unidentified serine-kinase activity. as we demonstrate that caveolin is both a transmembrane molecule and a major phospho-acceptor component of these complexes, we propose that caveolin could function as a transmembrane adaptor molecule that couples luminal gpi-linked proteins with cytoplasmically oriented signaling molecules during gpi-membrane trafficking or gpi-mediated signal transduction events. in addition, our results have implications for understanding v- src transformation and the actions of cholera and pertussis toxins on hetero-trimeric g proteins.
glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (gpi)-anchored proteins in candida albicans are responsible for a vast range of functions, and deletions in certain gpi-anchored proteins severely reduce adhesion and virulence of this organism. in addition, completely modified gpis are necessary for virulence. gpi anchor biosynthesis is essential for viability and starts with the transfer of n-acetylglucosamine to phosphatidylinositol. this step is catalysed by a multi-subunit complex, gpi-n-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (gpi-gnt). in this, the first report to our knowledge on a subunit of the candida gpi-gnt complex, we show that cagpi19p is the functional equivalent of the saccharomyces cerevisiae gpi19p. an n-terminal truncation mutant of cagpi19p functionally complements a conditionally lethal s. cerevisiae gpi19 mutant. further, we constructed a conditional null mutant of cagpi19 by disrupting one allele and placing the remaining copy under the control of the met3 promoter. repression leads to growth defects, cell wall biogenesis aberrations, azole sensitivity and hyperfilamention. in addition, there is a noticeable gene dosage effect, with the heterozygote also displaying intermediate degrees of most phenotypes. the mutants also displayed a reduced susceptibility to the antifungal agent amphotericin b. collectively, the results suggest that cagpi19 is required for normal morphology and cell wall architecture. abstract ras oncoproteins are monomeric gtpases that link signals from the cell surface to pathways that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. constitutively active mutant forms of ras are found in ca. 30% of human tumors. here we report the isolation of a novel gene from saccharomyces cerevisiae, designated eri1 (for endoplasmic reticulum-associated ras inhibitor 1), which behaves genetically as an inhibitor of ras signaling. eri1 encodes a 68-amino-acid protein that associates in vivo with gtp-bound ras in a manner that requires an intact ras-effector loop, suggesting that eri1 competes for the same binding site as ras target proteins. we show that eri1 localizes primarily to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (er), where it engages ras. the recent demonstration that signaling from mammalian ras is not restricted to the cell surface but can also proceed from the cytoplasmic face of the er suggests a regulatory function for eri1 at that membrane.
motivation molecular dynamics (md) simulations have had a profound impact on studies of membrane proteins during past two decades, but the accuracy of md simulations of membranes is limited by the quality of membrane models and the applied force fields. membrane models used in md simulations mostly contain one kind of lipid molecule. this is far from reality, for biological membranes always contain more than one kind of lipid molecule. moreover, the lipid composition and their distribution are functionally important. as a result, there is a necessity to prepare more realistic lipid membranes containing different types of lipids at physiological concentrations.   results to automate and simplify the building process of heterogeneous lipid bilayers as well as providing molecular topologies for included lipids based on both united and all-atom force fields, we provided membuilder as a web-based graphical user interface.   availability and implementation membuilder is a free web server available from www.membuilder.org. biological membranes are versatile in composition and host intriguing molecular processes. in order to be able to study these systems, an accurate model hamiltonian or force field (ff) is a necessity. here, we report the results of our extension of earlier developed all-atomistic ff parameters for fully saturated phospholipids that complements an earlier parameter set for saturated phosphatidylcholine lipids (j. phys. chem. b, 2012, 116, 3164-3179). the ff, coined slipids (stockholm lipids), now also includes parameters for unsaturated phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine lipids, e.g., popc, dopc, sopc, pope, and dope. as the extended set of parameters is derived with the same philosophy as previously applied, the resulting ff has been developed in a fully consistent manner. the capabilities of slipids are demonstrated by performing long simulations without applying any surface tension and using the correct isothermal-isobaric (npt) ensemble for a range of temperatures and carefully comparing a number of properties with experimental findings. results show that several structural properties are very well reproduced, such as scattering form factors, nmr order parameters, thicknesses, and area per lipid. thermal dependencies of different thicknesses and area per lipid are reproduced as well. lipid diffusion is systematically slightly underestimated, whereas the normalized lipid diffusion follows the experimental trends. this is believed to be due to the lack of collective movement in the relatively small bilayer patches used. furthermore, the compatibility with amino acid ffs from the amber family is tested in explicit transmembrane complexes of the walp23 peptide with dlpc and dopc bilayers, and this shows that slipids can be used to study more complex and biologically relevant systems.
this mono-institutional observational study was conducted to determine incidence, severity, risk factors, and outcome of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome/veno-occlusive disease (sos/vod) in high-risk ewing sarcoma (es) patients treated with intravenous busulfan and melphalan (bu-mel) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (asct). during the past 10 years, 75 consecutive es patients resulted evaluable for the analysis. after diagnosis of sos/vod, defibrotide therapy was started as soon as the medication was available. the variables analyzed as potential risk factors were: gender, patient's age at diagnosis, primary tumor site, disease stage, and prior radiation therapy (rt) given, focusing on rt liver exposure. the median age at diagnosis was 18.8 years. five patients developed moderate to severe sos/vod (cumulative incidence, 6.67%). none of 32 pediatric patients (≤17 years) developed sos/vod (p = 0.0674). in univariate analysis, prior rt liver exposure resulted statistically significant (p = 0.0496). there was one death due to severe sos/vod. this study reports the largest series of high-risk es patients treated with intravenous bu-mel before asct. the incidence of sos/vod was lower when compared with other studies that used oral busulfan. any prior rt liver exposure should be avoided. earlier defibrotide treatment confirms to be effective. sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, also known as veno-occlusive disease (sos/vod), is a potentially life threatening complication that can develop after hematopoietic cell transplantation. although sos/vod progressively resolves within a few weeks in most patients, the most severe forms result in multi-organ dysfunction and are associated with a high mortality rate (>80%). therefore, careful attention must be paid to allow an early detection of sos/vod, particularly as drugs have now proven to be effective and licensed for its treatment. unfortunately, current criteria lack sensitivity and specificity, making early identification and severity assessment of sos/vod difficult. the aim of this work is to propose a new definition for diagnosis, and a severity-grading system for sos/vod in adult patients, on behalf of the european society for blood and marrow transplantation.
relation extraction methods based on distant supervision rely on true tuples to retrieve noisy mentions, which are then used to train traditional supervised relation extraction methods. in this paper we analyze the sources of noise in the mentions, and explore simple methods to filter out noisy mentions. the results show that a combination of mention frequency cut-o, pointwise mutual information and removal of mentions which are far from the feature centroids of relation labels is able to signicantly improve the results of two relation extraction models. distant supervision for relation extraction (re) -- gathering training data by aligning a database of facts with text -- is an efficient approach to scale re to thousands of different relations. however, this introduces a challenging learning scenario where the relation expressed by a pair of entities found in a sentence is unknown. for example, a sentence containing balzac and france may express bornin or died, an unknown relation, or no relation at all. because of this, traditional supervised learning, which assumes that each example is explicitly mapped to a label, is not appropriate. we propose a novel approach to multi-instance multi-label learning for re, which jointly models all the instances of a pair of entities in text and all their labels using a graphical model with latent variables. our model performs competitively on two difficult domains.
the taxonomic classification of 182 phenotypically similar isolates was evaluated using dna-dna hybridization and 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. these bacterial isolates were mainly derived from clinical sources; all were gram-negative non-fermenters and most were indole-producing. phenotypically, they resembled species from the genera chryseobacterium, elizabethkingia or empedobacter or belonged to cdc groups iic, iie, iih and iii. based on these analyses, four novel species are described: chryseobacterium bernardetii sp. nov. (type strain nctc 13530(t) = ccug 60564(t) = cdc g229(t)), chryseobacterium carnis sp. nov. (type strain nctc 13525(t) = ccug 60559(t) = cdc g81(t)), chryseobacterium lactis sp. nov. (type strain nctc 11390(t) = ccug 60566(t) = cdc kc1864(t)) and chryseobacterium nakagawai sp. nov. (type strain nctc 13529(t) = ccug 60563(t) = cdc g41(t)). the new combination chryseobacterium taklimakanense comb. nov. (type strain nctc 13490(t) = x-65(t) = cctcc ab 208154(t) = nrrl b-51322(t)) is also proposed to accommodate the reclassified planobacterium taklimakanense. the name escherichia vulneris sp. nov. (formerly called alma group 1 and enteric group 1 by the centers for disease control and api group 2 by analytab products, inc.) is proposed for a group of isolates from the united states and canada, 74% of which were from human wounds. e. vulneris is a gram-negative, oxidase-negative, fermentative, motile rod with the characteristics of the family enterobacteriaceae. biochemical reactions characteristic of 61 e. vulneris strains were positive tests for methyl red, malonate, and lysine decarboxylase; a delayed positive test for arginine dihydrolase; acid production from d-mannitol, l-arabinose, raffinose, l-rhamnose, d-xylose, trehalose, cellobiose, and melibiose; negative tests for voges-proskauer, indole, urea, h(2)s, citrate, ornithine decarboxylase, phenylalanine deaminase, and dnase; and no acid from dulcitol, adonitol, myo-inositol, and d-sorbitol. two-thirds of the strains produced yellow pigment. most strains gave negative or delayed positive reactions in tests for lactose, sucrose, and kcn. the e. vulneris strains tested were resistant to penicillin and clindamycin, were resistant or showed intermediate zones of inhibition to carbenicillin and erythromycin, and were susceptible to 14 other antibiotics. dna relatedness of 15 e. vulneris strains to the type strain averaged 75% in reactions at 60 degrees c and 69% in reactions at 75 degrees c, indicating that they comprise a separate species. dna relatedness to other species in the family enterobacteriaceae was 6 to 39%, an indication that this new species belongs in the family. e. vulneris showed the highest relatedness to species of escherichia (25 to 39%) and enterobacter (24 to 35%). on the basis of biochemical similarity, the new species was placed in the genus escherichia. the type strain of e. vulneris is atcc 33821 (cdc 875-72).
the blood oxygenation level-dependent (bold) signal is widely used for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) of brain function in health and disease. the statistical power of fmri group studies is significantly hampered by high inter-subject variance due to differences in baseline vascular physiology. several methods have been proposed to account for physiological vascularization differences between subjects and hence improve the sensitivity in group studies. however, these methods require the acquisition of additional reference scans (such as a full resting-state fmri session or asl-based calibrated bold). we present a vascular autorescaling (vasa) method, which does not require any additional reference scans. vasa is based on the observation that slow oscillations (< 0.1 hz) in arterial blood co2 levels occur naturally due to changes in respiration patterns. these oscillations yield fmri signal changes whose amplitudes reflect the blood oxygenation levels and underlying local vascularization and vascular responsivity. vasa estimates proxies of the amplitude of these co2-driven oscillations directly from the residuals of task-related fmri data without the need for reference scans. the estimates are used to scale the amplitude of task-related fmri responses, to account for vascular differences. the vasa maps compared well to cerebrovascular reactivity (cvr) maps and cerebral blood volume maps based on vascular space occupancy (vaso) measurements in four volunteers, speaking to the physiological vascular basis of vasa. vasa was validated in a wide variety of tasks in 138 volunteers. vasa increased t-scores by up to 30% in specific brain areas such as the visual cortex. the number of activated voxels was increased by up to 200% in brain areas such as the orbital frontal cortex while still controlling the nominal false-positive rate. vasa fmri outperformed previously proposed rescaling approaches based on resting-state fmri data and can be readily applied to any task-related fmri data set, even retrospectively. the human connectome project (hcp) seeks to map the structural and functional connections between network elements in the human brain. magnetoencephalography (meg) provides a temporally rich source of information on brain network dynamics and represents one source of functional connectivity data to be provided by the hcp. high quality meg data will be collected from 50 twin pairs both in the resting state and during performance of motor, working memory and language tasks. these data will be available to the general community. additionally, using the cortical parcellation scheme common to all imaging modalities, the hcp will provide processing pipelines for calculating connection matrices as a function of time and frequency. together with structural and functional data generated using magnetic resonance imaging methods, these data represent a unique opportunity to investigate brain network connectivity in a large cohort of normal adult human subjects. the analysis pipeline software and the dynamic connectivity matrices that it generates will all be made freely available to the research community.
objective micrornas (mirnas) have become the focus of most recent efforts in cancer research. however, there have been inconsistencies in the literature regarding the suitability of circulating mirnas for early detection of gastrointestinal cancers. this study aims to assess the diagnostic performance of circulating mirnas in detection of gastrointestinal cancer through a meta-analysis. methods eligible studies were selected by conducting a systematic literature search of public databases. the sensitivity and specificity were used to plot the summary receiver operator characteristic (sroc) curve and calculate the area under the sroc curve (auc). the between-study heterogeneity was evaluated by q test and i 2 statistics. subgroup analyses and meta-regression were further performed to explore the potential sources of heterogeneity. all analyses were performed using the stata 12.0 software. results a total of 107 studies from 42 articles were included for the meta-analysis according to the inclusion criteria. the overall analysis of all gastrointestinal cancers showed that circulating mirnas have a relatively good diagnostic performance in gastrointestinal cancers, with a sensitivity of 0.75, a specificity of 0.81 and an auc of 0.85. in addition, subgroup analyses based on different type of mirna assay suggested that single-mirna assay displayed a relatively low diagnostic performance with the auc values of 0.84 for gastric cancer (gc) and 0.79 for colorectal cancer (crc), while multiple-mirnas assay significantly improved the diagnosing accuracy with auc rising to 0.92 for gc and 0.89 for crc. another interesting finding was that plasma-based mirna assay reach a higher accuracy compared with serum-based one for gc, while opposite conclusion was drawn for crc. conclusions in conclusion, circulating mirnas, particularly the combination of multiple mirnas, may present as promising biomarkers for the diagnosis of gastrointestinal cancers. further large-scale prospective studies are necessary to validate their potential applicability in human cancer diagnosis. background:plasma circulating tumour-specific micrornas (mirnas) are promising biomarkers of tumour presence and recurrence, especially for diseases whose best chance of successful treatment requires early diagnosis and timely surgery of an already malignant but not yet invasive tumour, such as colorectal cancer (crc).methods:expression levels of mirnas previously found to be differently expressed in tumour vs normal colon tissues were investigated by quantitative real-time pcr in plasma from crc patients and from healthy donors and confirmed in independent case control series. the validated mirnas were also measured after surgery. analyses were repeated on the subsets of haemolysis-free samples.results:we identified four mirnas differently expressed between the compared groups, two (mir-21 and mir-378) of which were validated. mir-378 expression decreased in non-relapsed patients 4–6 months after surgery and mir-378 ability to discriminate crc patients from healthy individuals was not influenced by haemolysis levels of plasma samples.conclusion:the mirna analysis on plasma samples represents a useful non-invasive tool to assess crc presence as well as tumour-free status at follow-up. plasma levels of mir-378 could be used to discriminate crc patients from healthy individuals, irrespective of the level of haemoglobin of plasma samples.
the molecular graph is a specific kind of graph. the classical method to solve the molecular graph matching problem is vf2 algorithm, where a heuristic is utilized to reduce the search space by analyzing the substructure of matched nodes. however, this heuristic invariant performs badly due to the strong similarity among some molecular graphs, thus the traditional vf2 algorithm has high time complexity. this paper introduces a novel heuristic invariant to effectively improve the computational efficiency, generated by the optimized circuit simulation method. we also conduct a series of experiments on pubchem dataset. the performance of the proposed algorithm is given by compared with the classical one. we present an iterative method for solving linear systems, which has the property of minimizing at every step the norm of the residual vector over a krylov subspace. the algorithm is derived from t...
under sustained, elevated building moisture conditions, bacterial and fungal growth occurs. the goal of this study was to characterize microbial growth in floor dust at variable equilibrium relative humidity (erh) levels. floor dust from one home was embedded in coupons cut from a worn medium-pile nylon carpet and incubated at 50%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, and 100% erh levels. quantitative pcr and dna sequencing of ribosomal dna for bacteria and fungi were used to quantify growth and community shifts. over a 1-wk period, fungal growth occurred above 80% erh. growth rates at 85% and 100% erh were 1.1 × 104 and 1.5 × 105 spore equivalents d-1 mg dust-1 , respectively. bacterial growth occurred only at 100% erh after 1 wk (9.0 × 104 genomes d-1 mg dust-1 ). growth resulted in significant changes in fungal (p<.00001) and bacterial community structure (p<.00001) at varying erh levels. comparisons between fungal taxa incubated at different erh levels revealed more than 100 fungal and bacterial species that were attributable to elevated erh. resuspension modeling indicated that more than 50% of airborne microbes could originate from the resuspension of fungi grown at erh levels of 85% and above. abstract we introduce here a new method for computing differences between microbial communities based on phylogenetic information. this method, unifrac, measures the phylogenetic distance between sets of taxa in a phylogenetic tree as the fraction of the branch length of the tree that leads to descendants from either one environment or the other, but not both. unifrac can be used to determine whether communities are significantly different, to compare many communities simultaneously using clustering and ordination techniques, and to measure the relative contributions of different factors, such as chemistry and geography, to similarities between samples. we demonstrate the utility of unifrac by applying it to published 16s rrna gene libraries from cultured isolates and environmental clones of bacteria in marine sediment, water, and ice. our results reveal that (i) cultured isolates from ice, water, and sediment resemble each other and environmental clone sequences from sea ice, but not environmental clone sequences from sediment and water; (ii) the geographical location does not correlate strongly with bacterial community differences in ice and sediment from the arctic and antarctic; and (iii) bacterial communities differ between terrestrially impacted seawater (whether polar or temperate) and warm oligotrophic seawater, whereas those in individual seawater samples are not more similar to each other than to those in sediment or ice samples. these results illustrate that unifrac provides a new way of characterizing microbial communities, using the wealth of environmental rrna sequences, and allows quantitative insight into the factors that underlie the distribution of lineages among environments.
the possibility of a contraceptive vaccine targeting human chorionic gonadotropin has long been recognized, but never fully realized. here we describe an epitope-specific approach based on immunogenic display of hcg-derived peptides on virus-like particles of rna bacteriophage. a number of recombinant vlps were constructed, each displaying a different hcg-derived peptide. some were taken from the disordered c-terminal tail of the hormone, another came from an internal loop, and yet another was an epitope mimic produced by affinity-selection on an hcg-neutralizing antibody target. immunization of mice with some vlps yielded antisera that bound the hormone and neutralized hcg biological activity. filamentous phages are now the most widely used vehicles for phage display and provide efficient means for epitope identification. however, the peptides they display are not very immunogenic because they normally fail to present foreign epitopes at the very high densities required for efficient b-cell activation. meanwhile, systems based on virus-like particles (vlps) permit the engineered high-density display of specific epitopes but are incapable of peptide library display and affinity selection. we developed a new peptide display platform based on vlps of the rna bacteriophage ms2. it combines the high immunogenicity of ms2 vlps with the affinity selection capabilities of other phage display systems. here, we describe plasmid vectors that facilitate the construction of high-complexity random sequence peptide libraries on ms2 vlps and that allow control of the stringency of affinity selection through the manipulation of display valency. we used the system to identify epitopes for several previously characterized monoclonal antibody targets and showed that the vlps thus obtained elicit antibodies in mice whose activities mimic those of the selecting antibodies.
drug-target interaction (dti) prediction is a challenging step in further drug repositioning, drug discovery and drug design. the advent of high-throughput technologies brings convenience to the development of dti prediction methods. with the generation of a high number of data sets, many mathematical models and computational algorithms have been developed to identify the potential drug-target pairs. however, most existing methods are proposed based on the single view data. by integrating the drug and target data from different views, we aim to get more stable and accurate prediction results. in this paper, a multiview dti prediction method based on clustering is proposed. we first introduce a model for single view drug-target data. the model is formulated as an optimization problem, which aims to identify the clusters in both drug similarity network and target protein similarity network, and at the same time make the clusters with more known dtis be connected together. then the model is extended to multiview network data by maximizing the consistency of the clusters in each view. an approximation method is proposed to solve the optimization problem. we apply the proposed algorithms to two views of data. comparisons with some existing algorithms show that the multiview dti prediction algorithm can produce more accurate predictions. for the considered data set, we finally predict 54 possible dtis. from the similarity analysis of the drugs/targets, enrichment analysis of dtis and genes in each cluster, it is shown that the predicted dtis have a high possibility to be true. identifying drug-target interactions has been a key step for drug repositioning, drug discovery and drug design. since it is expensive to determine the interactions experimentally, computational methods are needed for predicting interactions. in this work, the authors first propose a single-view penalised graph (spgraph) clustering approach to integrate drug structure and protein sequence data in a structural view. the spgraph model does clustering on drugs and targets simultaneously such that the known drug-target interactions are best preserved in the clustering results. they then apply the spgraph to a chemical view with drug response data and gene expression data in nci-60 cell lines. they further generalise the spgraph to a multi-view penalised graph (mpgraph) version, which can integrate the structural view and chemical view of the data. in the authors' experiments, they compare their approach with some comparison partners, and the results show that the spgraph could improve the prediction accuracy in a small scale, and the mpgraph can achieve around 10% improvements for the prediction accuracy. they finally give some new targets for 22 food and drug administration approved drugs for drug repositioning, and some can be supported by other references.
a series of chromone derivatives have been evaluated as potential cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2) inhibitors. the four most potent compounds, 48, 41, 39, and 35 displayed ic50 values of 3.30, 6.86, 7.36 and 7.46 µm, respectively. compounds 35 and 38 showed higher selectivity for cox-2 (selectivity index, si = 7.48 and 5.46, respectively) than celecoxib (si = 4.17 in the same test) whereas compound 39 showed comparable selectivity (si = 4.19) to celecoxib. the molecular volumes of compounds 35 (312.84 å3) and 38 (314.18 å3) were similar to celecoxib (299.28 å3) but larger than ibuprofen (211.83 å3). docking results were in good agreement with the experimental biological data in terms of evaluation of binding energy and binding mode. compounds 35, 38, and 39 had higher binding affinity against cox-2 (binding energy between −9.77 and −11.42 kcal/mole) than cox-1 (binding energy between −6.28 and −7.88 kcal/mole). these three chromone compounds also displayed active conformation in the same orientation as that of celecoxib. thus, compounds in this series has the potential to be a new class of selective cox-2 inhibitor. rous sarcoma virus was shown to induce in chicken embryo fibroblasts (cef) a 4.1-kilobase mrna (designated cef-147) encoding a 603-amino acid protein. analysis of the protein sequence showed that it shared 59% amino acid identity with sheep prostaglandin g/h synthase, the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting steps in the production of prostaglandins. significant differences, at both the protein and mrna levels, existed between the src oncogene product-inducible prostaglandin synthase and the protein isolated and cloned from sheep seminal vesicle, suggesting that the src-inducible prostaglandin synthase may be a new form of the enzyme. a distinguishing feature of src-inducible prostaglandin synthase mrna is its low abundance in nonproliferating chicken embryo fibroblasts and its relatively high abundance in src-transformed cells. additionally, the majority of the src-inducible prostaglandin synthase rna present in nonproliferating cells was found to be nonfunctional because of the presence of an unspliced intron that separated the signal peptide from the remainder of the protein. upon mitogenic stimulation, this intron was removed, resulting in the induction of fully-spliced cef-147 mrna.
hedgehog is an evolutionarily conserved developmental pathway, widely implicated in controlling various cellular responses such as cellular proliferation and stem cell renewal in human and other organisms, through external stimuli. aberrant activation of this pathway in human adult stem cell line may cause different types of cancers. hence, targeting this pathway in cancer therapy has become indispensable, but the non availability of detailed molecular interactions, complex regulations by extra- and intra-cellular proteins and cross talks with other pathways pose a serious challenge to get a coherent understanding of this signaling pathway for making therapeutic strategy. this motivated us to perform a computational study of the pathway and to identify probable drug targets. in this work, from available databases and literature, we reconstructed a complete hedgehog pathway which reports the largest number of molecules and interactions to date. using recently developed computational techniques, we further performed structural and logical analysis of this pathway. in structural analysis, the connectivity and centrality parameters were calculated to identify the important proteins from the network. to capture the regulations of the molecules, we developed a master boolean model of all the interactions between the proteins and created different cancer scenarios, such as glioma, colon and pancreatic. we performed perturbation analysis on these cancer conditions to identify the important and minimal combinations of proteins that can be used as drug targets. from our study we observed the under expressions of various oncoproteins in hedgehog pathway while perturbing at a time the combinations of the proteins gli1, gli2 and smo in glioma; smo, hfu, ulk3 and ras in colon cancer; smo, hfu, ulk3, ras and erk12 in pancreatic cancer. this reconstructed hedgehog signaling pathway and the computational analysis for identifying new combinatory drug targets will be useful for future in-vitro and in-vivo analysis to control different cancers. kit, platelet‐derived growth factor receptors (pdgfrs) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (vegfrs) are important clinical targets for tyrosine kinase inhibitors. the frequency of kit and vegfr2 amplification in glioblastomas is not known, and few data are available in any other human tumour type. we investigated 43 primary glioblastomas for kit, vegfr2, pdgfra and egfr amplification using fluorescence in situ hybridization. kit was amplified in 47% and vegfr2 in 39% of the glioblastomas, respectively, and pdgfra in 29%. thirty‐five (81%) of the tumours had either kit or egfr amplification. kit, pdgfra and vegfr2 amplifications were strongly associated (p < 0.0001 for each pairwise comparison), suggesting co‐amplification, whereas no significant association was found with egfr amplification. the four secondary glioblastomas arising from pre‐existing lower grade astrocytic tumours investigated had kit amplification but none had egfr amplification. no mutations were detected with denaturing high‐performance liquid chromatography in kit exons 9, 11, 13 or 17, pdgfra exons 12 and 18, or egfr exons 18, 19 or 21. glioblastomas with kit, pdgfr or vegfr2 amplification were associated with similar outcome to other glioblastomas. we conclude that kit, pdgfra and vegfr2 are commonly amplified in primary glioblastoma and that they may also be amplified in secondary glioblastoma. amplified kinases may be potential targets for tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. copyright © 2005 pathological society of great britain and ireland. published by john wiley & sons, ltd.
the mycetophilid fauna and environmental variables were studied at 15 sites within a spruce forest in southern norway. there were five replications of each of the following categories: semi-natural forests, clearcuts, and managed forests (clearcut 70–120 years ago). clearcutting seems to induce a long lasting effect on the mycetophilidae fauna. the semi-natural forests were more speciesrich and contained more ‘potentially rare’ species than the two other categories. even though managed forests and clearcuts differed in faunal composition, their species richness was not significantly different. continuity is probably a main factor for maintaining the diversity of mycetophilidae species. lumping the 15 sites together, the number of species was strongly correlated with the (temporal) continuity of tree cover and substrates, which may reflect an increased diversity of fungal habitats both in dead wood and on the ground. the degree of continuity was recognized by means of indicator species of fungi, lichen and vascular plants. the amount of dead wood was correlated with the species diversity, but was probably dependent on the continuity factor, since clearcuts with much dead wood had relatively fewer species.important elements in a strategy for conservation of the diversity of mycetophilid species seem to be: (i) to identify and protect the remnant patches of forests with long continuity, (ii) as far as possible, to practice timber harvesting in earlier clearcut forests instead of semi-natural forests. an understanding of statistical concepts and methods is essential for the clinician who wishes to interpret the results of clinical studies. in this article the concepts of descriptive statistics, classical hypothesis testing, p values, a priori information, and type i and type ii errors are discussed with examples to illustrate their application to the interpretation of clinical trials. in addition, descriptions of student's t test, the chi-squared test, fisher's exact test, the rank sum test, and sequential methods are given.
although the linguistic structure of speech provides valuable communicative information, nonverbal behaviors can offer additional, often disambiguating cues. in particular, being able to see the face and hand movements of a speaker facilitates language comprehension [1]. but how does the brain derive meaningful information from these movements? mouth movements provide information about phonological aspects of speech [2-3]. in contrast, cospeech gestures display semantic information relevant to the intended message [4-6]. we show that when language comprehension is accompanied by observable face movements, there is strong functional connectivity between areas of cortex involved in motor planning and production and posterior areas thought to mediate phonological aspects of speech perception. in contrast, language comprehension accompanied by cospeech gestures is associated with tuning of and strong functional connectivity between motor planning and production areas and anterior areas thought to mediate semantic aspects of language comprehension. these areas are not tuned to hand and arm movements that are not meaningful. results suggest that when gestures accompany speech, the motor system works with language comprehension areas to determine the meaning of those gestures. results also suggest that the cortical networks underlying language comprehension, rather than being fixed, are dynamically organized by the type of contextual information available to listeners during face-to-face communication. observing a speaker's mouth profoundly influences speech perception. for example, listeners perceive an "illusory" "ta" when the video of a face producing /ka/ is dubbed onto an audio /pa/. here, we show how cortical areas supporting speech production mediate this illusory percept and audiovisual (av) speech perception more generally. specifically, cortical activity during av speech perception occurs in many of the same areas that are active during speech production. we find that different perceptions of the same syllable and the perception of different syllables are associated with different distributions of activity in frontal motor areas involved in speech production. activity patterns in these frontal motor areas resulting from the illusory "ta" percept are more similar to the activity patterns evoked by av(/ta/) than they are to patterns evoked by av(/pa/) or av(/ka/). in contrast to the activity in frontal motor areas, stimulus-evoked activity for the illusory "ta" in auditory and somatosensory areas and visual areas initially resembles activity evoked by av(/pa/) and av(/ka/), respectively. ultimately, though, activity in these regions comes to resemble activity evoked by av(/ta/). together, these results suggest that av speech elicits in the listener a motor plan for the production of the phoneme that the speaker might have been attempting to produce, and that feedback in the form of efference copy from the motor system ultimately influences the phonetic interpretation.
blood pressure (bp) response to infused angiotensin ii (ang ii) has been widely used to characterize hypertensive subjects. high cholesterol levels hav recently been found to enhance this response in young men, suggesting an important new link between atherosclerosis and hypertension. the present study assessed the familial resemblance of the bp response following an ang ii infusion and measured the factors affecting the trait in a large set of hypertensive men and women. after a low-salt diet for 7 days a 30-min infusion of ang ii was administered to 218 white hypertensive patients (28 singletons, 80 sibling pairs, 10 trios). age and gender were significantly correlated to the ang ii systolic but not to the diastolic bp response. conversely, cholesterol level and especially low-density lipoprotein (ldl) were correlated to both systolic and diastolic changes. multivariate analysis showed that age, gender, and ldl were the three parameters that explained the systolic bp change whereas plasma ldl remained the only variable significantly correlated to the diastolic bp change. significant familial resemblances in the ang ii induced systolic and diastolic bp response were observed, especially in female pairs. on this limited number of subjects, suggestive evidence for association and linkage was found between the trait, a1166c, and (ca)n repeat polymorphisms of the ang ii type 1 receptor (at1r) gene. in conclusion, the ang ii induced bp change is strongly related to plasma ldl in hypertensive men and women, stressing the importance of the lipid profile as a contributor to bp regulation. familial resemblance of this intermediate phenotype is sex dependent and may be partly explained by polymorphisms of the at1r gene. the aldosterone response to infused angiotensin ii (ang ii) in patients receiving a low-salt diet has been described as an important phenotype for genetic studies on human hypertension. the objectives of the present study were to determine the parameters that influence this intermediate phenotype as a quantitative trait and to assess the importance of its familial resemblance in hypertensive sibling pairs. two hundred one white hypertensive subjects (95 families: 84 pairs and 11 trios) were selected in 3 centers. the patients followed the same protocol, which included a 4-week withdrawal period of antihypertensive therapy, a 1-week period on a low-salt diet, and a 30-minute infusion of ang ii. the increase in the aldosterone level was greater in women than in men (29.1+/-16.2 versus 18.2+/-9.6 ng/dl, p<0.0001). a strong relationship was found with age (r=-0.54, p<10(-4)) and plasma renin activity (r=0.32, p<10(-4)) in women but not in men. weak correlations of the aldosterone response to ang ii were observed for the whole set of sibling pairs (r=0.11, ns). conversely, strong sibling correlations were found among brother-brother pairs (r=0.40, n=36) and among sister-sister pairs as soon as age or menopausal status was considered. similar results were obtained when the ang i-aldosterone response was analyzed as a qualitative trait (kappa=0. 35, p<0.008 in brother-brother pairs). we conclude that age, gender, and plasma renin are strong determinants of the aldosterone response to ang ii, with strong sibling correlations in men and postmenopausal women. these relationships will have to be considered in future linkage and association studies.

despite being silent with respect to protein sequence, synonymous nucleotide substitutions can be targeted by natural selection directly at the dna or rna level. however, there has been no systematic assessment of how frequent this type of selection is. here, we have constructed 53 single random synonymous substitution mutants of the bacteriophages qβ and φx174 by site-directed mutagenesis and assayed their fitness. analysis of this mutant collection and of previous studies undertaken with a variety of single-stranded (ss) viruses demonstrates that selection at synonymous sites is stronger in rna viruses than in dna viruses. we estimate that this type of selection contributes approximately 18% of the overall mutational fitness effects in ssrna viruses under our assay conditions and that random synonymous substitutions have a 5% chance of being lethal to the virus, whereas in ssdna viruses, these figures drop to 1.4% and 0%, respectively. in contrast, the effects of nonsynonymous substitutions appear to be similar in ssrna and ssdna viruses. mutational fitness effects can be measured with relatively high accuracy in viruses due to their small genome size, which facilitates full-length sequencing and genetic manipulation. previous work has shown that animal and plant rna viruses are very sensitive to mutation. here, we characterize mutational fitness effects in single-stranded (ss) dna and ssrna bacterial viruses. first, we performed a mutation-accumulation experiment in which we subjected three ssdna (φx174, g4, f1) and three ssrna phages (qβ, ms2, and sp) to plaque-to-plaque transfers and chemical mutagenesis. genome sequencing and growth assays indicated that the average fitness effect of the accumulated mutations was similar in the two groups. second, we used site-directed mutagenesis to obtain 45 clones of φx174 and 42 clones of qβ carrying random single-nucleotide substitutions and assayed them for fitness. in φx174, 20% of such mutations were lethal, whereas viable ones reduced fitness by 13% on average. in qβ, these figures were 29% and 10%, respectively. it seems therefore that high mutational sensitivity is a general property of viruses with small genomes, including those infecting animals, plants, and bacteria. mutational fitness effects are important for understanding processes of fitness decline, but also of neutral evolution and adaptation. as such, these findings can contribute to explain the evolution of ssdna and ssrna viruses.
people often recruit social resources to manage their emotions, a phenomenon known as interpersonal emotion regulation (ier). despite its importance, ier’s psychological structure remains poorly understood. we propose that two key dimensions describe ier: (a) individuals’ tendency to pursue ier in response to emotional events, and (b) the efficacy with which they perceive ier improves their emotional lives. to probe these dimensions, we developed the interpersonal regulation questionnaire (irq), a valid and reliable measure of individual differences in ier. factor analyses of participants’ responses confirmed tendency and efficacy as independent dimensions of ier (study 1; n = 285), and demonstrated independence between how individuals engage with ier in response to negative, versus positive, emotion. in study 2 (n = 347), we found that individuals high in ier tendency and efficacy are more emotionally expressive, empathetic, and socially connected. two subsequent studies highlighted behavioral consequences of ier dimensions: people high in ier tendency sought out others more often following experimentally induced emotion (study 3; n = 400), and individuals high in ier efficacy benefitted more from social support after real-world emotional events (study 4; n = 787). finally, a field study of social networks in freshman dormitories revealed that individuals high in ier tendency and efficacy developed more supportive relationships during the first year of college (study 5; n = 193). these data (a) identify distinct dimensions underlying ier, (b) demonstrate that these dimensions can be stably measured and separated from related constructs, and (c) reveal their implications for relationships and well-being. we developed a multidimensional coping inventory to assess the different ways in which people respond to stress. five scales (of four items each) measure conceptually distinct aspects of problem-focused coping (active coping, planning, suppression of competing activities, restraint coping, seeking of instrumental social support); five scales measure aspects of what might be viewed as emotional-focused coping (seeking of emotional social support, positive reinterpretation, acceptance, denial, turning to religion); and three scales measure coping responses that arguably are less useful (focus on and venting of emotions, behavioral disengagement, mental disengagement). study 1 reports the development of scale items. study 2 reports correlations between the various coping scales and several theoretically relevant personality measures in an effort to provide preliminary information about the inventory's convergent and discriminant validity. study 3 uses the inventory to assess coping responses among a group of undergraduates who were attempting to cope with a specific stressful episode. this study also allowed an initial examination of associations between dispositional and situational coping tendencies.
to study the relationship between the local and systemic aerobic fitness parameters, and between the muscle oxygenation and aerobic performance, 16 female finswimmers were recruited and divided into high-level (hl) group and low-level group. cardiorespiratory function, blood lactate concentration and near infrared spectroscopy muscle oxygenation in the vastus lateralis (vl) were monitored simultaneously during a maximal incremental exercise. we found that the break point (bp) of the oxygenation index (oi) in the vl (bpvl) had significant correlations with lactate threshold (lt) and gas exchange threshold (get), and the appearance sequence of the three thresholds was bpvl ≈ lt ≤ get. when considering different levels, the $$ \dot{v}{\text{o}}_{2} $$ at bpvl, lt and get were higher in the hl group. during intensive exercise, there were significantly faster $$ \dot{v}{\text{o}}_{2} $$ increase and evidently slower oi decrease in the hl group, suggesting that faster $$ \dot{v}{\text{o}}_{2} $$ increase in the hl group slowed down the muscle deoxygenation and facilitated subjects to cycle to higher workloads. in conclusion, multi-modality approaches combining local and systemic physiological monitoring technologies might provide better explanations of the relationship between local and systemic aerobic fitness parameters, and might be a novel way to analyze the difference between groups of different levels. our purpose is to compare the changes in muscle oxygenation in the vastus lateralis (vl) and biceps brachii (bb) muscles simultaneously using near-infrared spectroscopy (nirs) during incremental rowing exercise in eight rowers. based on the bb and vl muscle oxygenation patterns, two points are used to characterize the muscle oxygenation kinetics in both the arm and the leg muscles. the first point is the breaking point (bp), which refers to an accelerated fall in muscle oxygenation that correlates with the gas exchange threshold (get). the second point is the leveling-off point (lo), which suggests the upper limit of o(2) extraction. the get occurred at 63.3+/-2.4% of maximal oxygen uptake (vo(2 max)). the bp appeared at 45.0+/-3.8% and 55.6+/-2.4% vo(2 max) in the bb and vl, respectively. the lo appeared at 63.6+/-4.1% and 86.6+/-1.0% vo(2 max) in these two muscles, respectively. both the bp and the lo occurred earlier in bb compared with vl. these results suggest that arm muscles have lower oxidative capacity than leg muscles during rowing exercise. the rowers with higher exercise performances showed heavier workloads, as evaluated by bp and lo. the monitoring of muscle oxygenation by nirs in arm and leg muscles during rowing could be a useful guide for evaluation and training.
backgroundcilia are critical for diverse functions, from motility to signal transduction, and ciliary dysfunction causes inherited diseases termed ciliopathies. several ciliopathy proteins influence developmental signalling and aberrant signalling explains many ciliopathy phenotypes. ciliary compartmentalisation is essential for function, and the transition zone (tz), found at the proximal end of the cilium, has recently emerged as a key player in regulating this process. ciliary compartmentalisation is linked to two protein complexes, the mks and nphp complexes, at the tz that consist largely of ciliopathy proteins, leading to the hypothesis that ciliopathy proteins affect signalling by regulating ciliary content. however, there is no consensus on complex composition, formation, or the contribution of each component.resultsusing bioinformatics, we examined the evolutionary patterns of tz complex proteins across the extant eukaryotic supergroups, in both ciliated and non-ciliated organisms. we show that tz complex proteins are restricted to the proteomes of ciliated organisms and identify a core conserved group (tmem67, cc2d2a, b9d1, b9d2, ahi1 and a single tctn, plus perhaps mks1) which are present in >50% of all ciliate/flagellate organisms analysed in each supergroup. the smaller nphp complex apparently evolved later than the larger mks complex; this result may explain why rpgrip1l, which forms the linker between the two complexes, is not one of the core conserved proteins. we also uncovered a striking correlation between lack of tz proteins in non-seed land plants and loss of tz-specific ciliary y-links that link microtubule doublets to the membrane, consistent with the interpretation that these proteins are structural components of y-links, or regulators of their formation.conclusionsthis bioinformatic analysis represents the first systematic analysis of the cohort of tz complex proteins across eukaryotic evolution. given the near-ubiquity of only 6 proteins across ciliated eukaryotes, we propose that the mks complex represents a dynamic complex built around these 6 proteins and implicated in y-link formation and ciliary permeability. nephronophthisis (nphp), joubert (jbts), and meckel-gruber (mks) syndromes are autosomal-recessive ciliopathies presenting with cystic kidneys, retinal degeneration, and cerebellar/neural tube malformation. whether defects in kidney, retinal, or neural disease primarily involve ciliary, hedgehog, or cell polarity pathways remains unclear. using high-confidence proteomics, we identified 850 interactors copurifying with nine nphp/jbts/mks proteins and discovered three connected modules: "nphp1-4-8" functioning at the apical surface, "nphp5-6" at centrosomes, and "mks" linked to hedgehog signaling. assays for ciliogenesis and epithelial morphogenesis in 3d renal cultures link renal cystic disease to apical organization defects, whereas ciliary and hedgehog pathway defects lead to retinal or neural deficits. using 38 interactors as candidates, linkage and sequencing analysis of 250 patients identified atxn10 and tctn2 as new nphp-jbts genes, and our tctn2 mouse knockout shows neural tube and hedgehog signaling defects. our study further illustrates the power of linking proteomic networks and human genetics to uncover critical disease pathways.
this review provides a summary of methods originated in (non-equilibrium) statistical mechanics and information theory, which have recently found successful applications to quantitatively studying complexity in various components of the complex system earth. specifically, we discuss two classes of methods: (i) entropies of different kinds (e.g., on the one hand classical shannon and r´enyi entropies, as well as non-extensive tsallis entropy based on symbolic dynamics techniques and, on the other hand, approximate entropy, sample entropy and fuzzy entropy); and (ii) measures of statistical interdependence and causality (e.g., mutual information and generalizations thereof, transfer entropy, momentary information transfer). we review a number of applications and case studies utilizing the above-mentioned methodological approaches for studying contemporary problems in some exemplary fields of the earth sciences, highlighting the potentials of different techniques. entropy, as it relates to dynamical systems, is the rate of information production. methods for estimation of the entropy of a system represented by a time series are not, however, well suited to analysis of the short and noisy data sets encountered in cardiovascular and other biological studies. pincus introduced approximate entropy (apen), a set of measures of system complexity closely related to entropy, which is easily applied to clinical cardiovascular and other time series. apen statistics, however, lead to inconsistent results. we have developed a new and related complexity measure, sample entropy (sampen), and have compared apen and sampen by using them to analyze sets of random numbers with known probabilistic character. we have also evaluated cross-apen and cross-sampen, which use cardiovascular data sets to measure the similarity of two distinct time series. sampen agreed with theory much more closely than apen over a broad range of conditions. the improved accuracy of sampen statistics should make them useful in the study of experimental clinical cardiovascular and other biological time series.
introductionrecently, we reported a high prevalence of immunoglobulin g and/or immunoglobulin m anticardiolipin antibodies (acl) in patients with autoimmune liver diseases, namely, autoimmune hepatitis (aih), primary biliary cirrhosis (pbc), and primary sclerosing cholangitis (psc), which were independent of the respective isotypes of antibodies against β2-glycoprotein i (anti-b2gpi). immunoglobulin a (iga) acl and iga anti-b2gpi are the least studied of the three specific isotypes either in antiphospholipid syndrome (aps) or in other conditions.methodstherefore, we investigated the prevalence and clinical significance of iga anti-b2gpi and iga acl by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in another set of caucasian patients with autoimmune liver diseases (59 aih, 96 pbc, and 37 psc). the disease controls group consisted of 50 hepatitis c virus (hcv) patients, 50 hepatitis b virus (hbv), 30 alcoholic liver disease (ald), 30 non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (nash), and 110 healthy controls.results and discussioniga anti-b2gpi prevalence was higher in aih (50.8%) compared to pbc (p = 0.005), psc (p = 0.008), nash (p = 0.004), ald (p = 0.01), and hcv (p = 0.002). the titers were also significantly higher in aih compared to any other group of the study. iga acl prevalence was higher in aih (33.9%) compared to pbc (p = 0.005), psc (p = 0.014), nash (p = 0.001), ald (p = 0.004), and hcv (p < 0.001). iga anti-b2gpi or iga acl were not associated with aps features in patients with liver autoimmunity. of note, iga anti-b2gpi and iga acl were associated with clinical and biochemical markers of disease severity in aih and pbc. we demonstrated a high prevalence and high titers of iga anti-b2gpi in patients with aih compared to any other liver disease of the study.conclusioniga anti-b2gpi and iga acl were associated with the severity and biochemical activity of aih and pbc, but long-term prospective studies are needed to address whether this new finding is of clinical importance in aih and pbc patients. background primary biliary cirrhosis (pbc)-specific anti-mitochondrial antibodies (ama), routinely detected by indirect immunofluoresnce, immunofix various mitochondrial antigens by immunoblot (ib). we have investigated whether there is a relationship between ifl-determined ama titres and the number, intensity or pattern of ib-bands.   methods by computer-assisted imaging technology, an ib analysis using human liver mitochondrial preparation was performed in 100 ama positive pbc samples, subdivided in 5 groups each consisting of 20 cases with very high, high, intermediate, low or borderline ifl titres and in 19 ama-negative cases.   results reactivity to at least 1 mitochondrial band (range 1-12) was present in 114 (96%) cases. reactivity to the major pyruvate dehydrogenase e2-subunit 74-kda autoantigen positively correlated with ama ifl titres but was absent in 25% ifl-positive cases. the intensity and number of ib-bands differed significantly among groups (p<0.001). ifl ama titres positively correlated with the total number (r=0.8, p<0.001) and the intensity of the ib-bands (r=0.75, p<0.001).   conclusions our study indicates that ifl-determined ama relate to the number and intensity of immunofixed bands. reactivity to pdc-e2 does not correlate with ifl titres in a considerable proportion of patients suggesting that detection methods of ama need to be based in the entire spectrum of the disease-specific mitochondrial antigens.
pantoea agglomerans ys19 is an endophytic diazotrophic bacterium isolated from rice. as well as having the ability to form a biofilm, as do most bacteria, it is characterized by the formation of a unique multicellular aggregate structure called symplasmata. indole is traditionally known as a metabolite of the amino acid tryptophan, which, however, has recently been shown to participate in various regulations of bacterial physiological processes, including stress resistance, quorum sensing and biofilm formation. here, an indole signal was found to promote symplasmata formation, yet inhibit biofilm formation, indicating different regulatory pathways of indole in the construction of the two structures. however, symplasmata showed almost an equivalent stress-resistant capability, as compared with biofilms, for ys19 to confront acids, heavy metals (cu(2+)), and uv treatments. moreover, indole was tested to show a promoting effect on exopolysaccharides (eps) production and an inhibition effect on the expression of an outer membrane protein ompw. these results provide evidence for understanding the regulatory mechanisms of indole on such multicellular aggregates. abstract the l-tryptophan degradation product indole is a purported extracellular signaling molecule that influences biofilm formation in various bacteria. here we analyzed the mechanisms of indole production in fusobacterium nucleatum and the effects of tryptophan and indole on f. nucleatum planktonic and biofilm cells. the amino acid sequence deduced from the fn1943 gene in f. nucleatum atcc 25586 was 28% identical to that deduced from tnaa in escherichia coli, which encodes tryptophanase catalyzing the β-elimination of l-tryptophan to produce indole. the fn1943 gene was cotranscribed with the downstream gene fn1944, which is a homolog of tnab encoding low-affinity tryptophan permease. the transcript started at position −68 or −153 from the first nucleotide of the fn1943 translation initiation codon. real-time quantitative pcr showed that much more f. nucleatum fn1943 transcripts were obtained from log-phase cells than from stationary-phase cells. indole production by the purified recombinant protein encoded by fn1943 was examined using high-performance liquid chromatography. the km and kcat of the enzyme were 0.26 ± 0.03 mm and 0.74 ± 0.04 s−1, respectively. f. nucleatum biofilm formation and the biofilm supernatant concentration of indole increased dose dependently with increasing tryptophan concentrations. exogenous indole also increased f. nucleatum biofilm formation in a dose-dependent manner. even at very high concentrations, tryptophan did not affect fn1943 expression, whereas similar indole concentrations decreased expression. thus, exogenous tryptophan and indole were suggested to increase f. nucleatum biofilms.
the 165-kb megaplasmid pao1 of arthrobacter nicotinovorans carries two large gene clusters, one involved in nicotine catabolism (nic-gene cluster) and one in carbohydrate utilization (ch-gene cluster). here, we propose that both gene clusters were acquired by a. nicotinovorans by horizontal gene transfer mediated by pao1. protein–protein blast search showed that none of the published arthrobacter genomes contains nic-genes, but rhodococcus opacus carries on its chromosome a nic-gene cluster highly similar to that of pao1. analysis of the nic-genes in the two species suggested a recombination event between their nic-gene clusters. apparently, there was a gene exchange between pao1, or a precursor plasmid, and a nic-gene cluster of an as yet unidentified arthrobacter specie or other soil bacterium, possibly related to rhodococcus, leading to the transfer by pao1 of this catabolic trait to a. nicotinovorans. analysis of the pao1 ch-gene cluster revealed a virtually identical counterpart on the chromosome of arthrobacter phenanthrenivorans. moreover, the sequence analysis of the genes flanking the ch-gene cluster suggested that it was acquired by pao1 by xer-related site directed recombination and transferred via the plasmid to a. nicotinovorans. the g+c content, the level of sequence identity, gene co-linearity of nic- and ch-gene clusters as well as the signs of recombination events clearly supports the notion of pao1 and its precursor plasmids as vehicles in hgt among gram + soil bacteria. javascript is an object-based scripting language that can be interpreted by most commonly used web browsers, including netscape® navigator® and internet explorer®. in conjunction with html form elements, javascript can be used to make flexible and easy-to-use applications that can be accessed by anyone connected to the internet (3). the sequence manipulation suite (http://www.ualberta.ca/~stothard/javascript/) is a collection of freely available javascript applications for molecular biologists. it consists of over 30 utilities for analyzing and manipulating sequence data, including the following:
this paper describes our contribution to two challenges in data-driven lemmatization. we approach lemmatization in the framework of a two-stage process, where first lemma candidates are generated and afterwards a ranker chooses the most probable lemma from these candidates. the first challenge is that languages with rich morphology like modern german can feature morphological changes of different kinds, in particular word-internal modification. this makes the generation of the correct lemma a harder task than just removing suffixes (stemming). the second challenge that we address is spelling variation as it appears in non-standard texts. we experiment with different generators that are specifically tailored to deal with these two challenges. we show in an oracle setting that there is a possible increase in lemmatization accuracy of 14% with our methods to generate lemma candidates on middle low german, a group of historical dialects of german (1200‐1650 ad). using a log-linear model to choose the correct lemma from the set, we obtain an actual increase of 5.56%. we present a comparative investigation of word representations for part-of-speech (pos) and morphological tagging, focusing on scenarios with considerable differences between training and test data where a robust approach is necessary. instead of adapting the model towards a specific domain we aim to build a robust model across domains. we developed a test suite for robust tagging consisting of six languages and different domains. we find that representations similar to brown clusters perform best for pos tagging and that word representations based on linguistic morphological analyzers perform best for morphological tagging.
background the investigation of rare familial forms of kidney cancer has provided important insights into the biology of sporadic renal cell carcinoma (rcc). in particular, the identification of the von hippel lindau (vhl) familial cancer syndrome gene (vhl) provided the basis for the discovery that vhl is somatically inactivated in most sporadic clear cell rcc. many cases of familial rcc do not have mutations in known rcc susceptibility genes and there is evidence that genetic modifiers may influence the risk of rcc in vhl disease patients. hence we hypothesised that low-penetrance functional genetic variants in pathways related to the vhl protein (pvhl) function might (a) modify the phenotypic expression of vhl disease and/or (b) predispose to sporadic rcc. methodology/principal findings we tested this hypothesis for functional polymorphisms in cdh1 (rs16260), igfbp3 (rs2854744), mmp1 (rs1799750), mmp3 (rs679620), stk15 (rs2273535) and vegf (rs1570360). we observed that variants of mmp1 and mmp3 were significant modifiers of rcc risk (and risks of retinal angioma and cerebellar haemangioblastoma) in vhl disease patients. in addition, higher frequencies of the mmp1 rs1799750 2g allele (p = 0.017, or 1.49, 95%ci 1.06–2.08) and the mmp1/mmp3 rs1799750/rs679620 2g/g haplotype (or 1.45, 95%ci 1.01–2.10) were detected in sporadic rcc patients than in controls (n = 295). conclusions/significance these findings (a) represent the first example of genetic modifiers of rcc risk in vhl disease, (b) replicate a previous report of an association between mmp1/mmp3 variants and sporadic rcc and (c) further implicate mmp1/mmp3-related pathways in the pathogenesis of familial and sporadic rcc. the search of inherited cancer susceptibility factors is an important subject in cancer epidemiology. analyses of single nucleotide polymorphisms (snp) in various genes revealed a correlation between the presence of specific allelic variants and cancer predisposition in diverse malignancies. stk15 is an important protein in control of the integrity of the mitotic spindle apparatus and genomic stability. we analysed the distribution of the functionally important t91a snp in the stk15 gene in a cohort of renal cell carcinoma (rcc) patients and compared it to the distribution in a control group without malignancies. dna from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded healthy renal tissue (rcc patients) or peripheral blood samples (control group) was isolated according to standard protocols. allelic variant of stk15 nucleotide 91 was determined using restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis. overall, 156 rcc patients and 158 patients without any malignancy were analysed. the distribution of the a/a, 7.59%). there was also no correlation between genotype and tumour grade or stage or other histopathological characteristics of the tumours. this first analysis of the stk15 t91a snp in rcc patients revealed no correlation between a certain allelic variant and an increased risk for rcc.
social interactions facilitate pathogen transmission and increase virulence. therefore, species that live in social groups are predicted to suffer a higher pathogen burden, to invest more heavily in immune defence against pathogens, or both. however, there are few empirical tests of whether social species indeed invest more heavily in immune defence than non-social species. in the current study, we conducted a phylogenetically controlled comparison of innate immune response in lamprologine cichlid fishes. we focused on three species of highly social cichlids that live in permanent groups and exhibit cooperative breeding (julidochromis ornatus, neolamprologus pulcher and neolamprologus savoryi) and three species of non-social cichlids that exhibit neither grouping nor cooperative behaviour (telmatochromis temporalis, neolamprologus tetracanthus and neolamprologus modestus). we quantified the innate immune response by injecting wild fishes with phytohaemagglutinin (pha), a lectin that causes a cell-mediated immune response. we predicted that the three highly social species would show a greater immune reaction to the pha treatment, indicating higher investment in immune defence against parasites relative to the three non-social species. we found significant species-level variation in immune response, but contrary to our prediction, this variation did not correspond to social system. however, we found that immune response was correlated with territory size across the six species. our results indicate that the common assumption of a positive relationship between social system and investment in immune function may be overly simplistic. we suggest that factors such as rates of both in-group and out-group social interactions are likely to be important mediators of the relationship between sociality and immune function. many studies have attempted to explain the evolution of cooperation, yet little attention has been paid to what factors control the amount or kind of cooperation performed. kin selection theory suggests that more cooperation, or help, should be given by relatives. however, recent theory suggests that under specific ecological and demographic conditions, unrelated individuals must ‘pay to stay’ in the group and therefore may help more. we tested these contrasting predictions using the cooperatively breeding fish, neolamprologus pulcher, and found that the degree of work effort by helpers depended on which helping behaviours were considered and on their level of relatedness to the breeding male or female. in the field, helpers unrelated to the breeding male performed more territory defence, while helpers unrelated to the breeding female contributed less to territory defence. in the laboratory, unrelated group members helped more. our work demonstrates that a number of factors in addition to kinship shape cooperative investment patterns.
objectivesthe aim of this study was to explore the influence of the characteristics of japanese patients on the long-term outcomes after aortic valve replacement with either mechanical or biological prostheses by means of a microsimulation.methodsa microsimulation model was used to simulate the lives of patients living in japan and in the united states after aortic valve replacement. the background mortality data taken from the 21st complete life table of japan and the bleeding hazard determined from a meta-analysis of long-term results in japanese institutions were used to simulate japanese patients. the life expectancy, event-free life expectancy, and lifetime risk of structural valve degeneration were calculated. a sensitivity analysis for various bleeding hazards was performed.resultsregarding the event-free life expectancy, the age crossover points between the two valve types were 64–65 and 57–58 years for japanese and american patients, respectively. regarding the life expectancy, the age crossover points were 88–89 and 64–65 years, respectively, for japanese and american patients. the lifetime risk of structural valve degeneration was higher in japanese patients than in american patients. the sensitivity analysis showed that the age crossover points were sensitive to the hazard of bleeding complications.conclusionsthe long-term clinical outcomes after aortic valve replacement were simulated with a microsimulation model. the results indicated that the age crossover points in the advantages and disadvantages between mechanical valves and bioprostheses may be higher in japanese patients than in american subjects. background the second-generation carpentier-edwards pericardial valve (edwards lifesciences llc, irvine, ca) is widely used for aortic valve replacement. however, knowledge on the long-term outcomes of patients after valve implantation is incomplete. we used microsimulation to calculate the long-term outcome of any given patient after aortic valve replacement with the carpentier-edwards pericardial valve.   methods a meta-analysis of 8 reports on aortic valve replacement with the carpentier-edwards pericardial valve (2,685 patients; 12,250 patient years) was used to estimate the hazards of valve-related events other than structural valvular deterioration. structural valvular deterioration was described by age-dependent weibull curves calculated from 18-year follow-up, premarket approval, carpentier-edwards pericardial primary data. these estimates provided the input data for the parameters of the microsimulation model, which was then used to calculate the outcomes of patients of different ages after valve implantation. the model estimates of survival were validated using two external data sets.   results the weibull analysis estimated a median time to reoperation for structural valvular deterioration ranging from 18.1 years for a 55-year-old male to 23.2 years for a 75-year-old male. for a 65-year-old male, microsimulation calculated a life expectancy and event-free life expectancy of 10.8 and 9.1 years, respectively. the lifetime risk of at least one valve-related event was 38% and that of reoperation due to structural valvular deterioration 17%, respectively, for this patient. the model estimates of survival showed good agreement with external data.   conclusions microsimulation provides detailed insight into the long-term prognosis of patients after aortic valve replacement. the carpentier-edwards pericardial valve performs satisfactorily and offers a low lifetime risk of reoperation due to structural valvular deterioration, especially for elderly patients requiring aortic valve replacement.
there is increasing evidence that tgf-beta family member cytokine bone morphogenetic protein (bmp)-4 plays different pathophysiological roles in the pulmonary and systemic circulation. upregulation of bmp-4 has been linked to atherosclerosis and hypertension in the systemic circulation, whereas disruption of bmp-4 signaling is associated with the development of pulmonary hypertension. to test the hypothesis that bmp-4 elicits differential effects in the pulmonary and systemic circulation, we compared the prooxidant and proinflammatory effects of bmp-4 in cultured human coronary arterial endothelial cells (caecs) and pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (paecs). we found that bmp-4 (from 0.3 to 10 ng/ml) in caecs increased o(2)(*-) and h(2)o(2) generation, induced nf-kappab activation, upregulated icam-1, and induced monocyte adhesiveness to ecs. in contrast, bmp-4 failed to induce oxidative stress or endothelial activation in paecs. also, bmp-4 treatment impaired acetylcholine-induced relaxation and increased o(2)(*-) production in cultured rat carotid arteries, whereas cultured rat pulmonary arteries were protected from these adverse effects of bmp-4. thus, we propose that bmp-4 exerts prooxidant, prohypertensive, and proinflammatory effects only in the systemic circulation, whereas pulmonary arteries are protected from these adverse effects of bmp-4. the vascular bed-specific endothelial effects of bmp-4 are likely to contribute to its differential pathophysiological role in the systemic and pulmonary circulation. objective—bone morphogenetic protein 4 (bmp-4) is a transforming growth factor &bgr; family member cytokine that exerts proinflammatory effects on the endothelium and is likely to play a role in atherogenesis. recent studies suggested that atheroprotective levels of shear stress control endothelial bmp-4 expression; however, the underlying mechanisms remained unknown. methods and results—we found that shear stress downregulated bmp-4 expression in human and rat coronary arterial endothelial cells (caecs) as well as in cultured mesenteric arterioles, although it had no effect on the expression of bmp-2, a related cytokine. in human coronary arterial endothelial cells, 8-bromo-camp, the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin, or a camp-dependent protein kinase (pka) activator effectively decreased bmp-4 expression, mimicking the effects of shear stress. indeed, shear stress induced the nuclear translocation of pka-c, and inhibition of pka attenuated the effects of shear stress and forskolin on bmp-4 expression. rna decay assay and bmp-4 promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene assay showed that camp regulates bmp-4 expression at the transcriptional level. conclusions—laminar shear stress and the camp/pka pathway are important negative regulators of bmp-4 expression in the vascular endothelium. because bmp-4 elicits endothelial activation and dysfunction, hypertension, and vascular calcification, inhibition of bmp-4 expression by shear stress and the camp/pka pathway is likely to exert antiatherogenic and vasculoprotective effects.
small cardamom (elettaria cardamomum maton) is extensively cultivated in the western ghats of south india either as a monocrop under the forest trees or as an intercrop along with arecanut and coffee plantations. colletotrichum species responsible for severe outbreaks of anthracnose on small cardamom in south india are reported. small cardamom anthracnose, popularly known as “chenthal”, manifests itself on the foliage as yellowish lesions, which later coalesce to form large blighted areas. in advanced stages, the affected leaves dry up giving a burnt appearance to the plant. twenty-five isolates of colletotrichum were isolated from leaves of small cardamom in karnataka, kerala and tamil nadu states of india. the isolates were characterized through morphological studies and multilocus phylogenetic analysis (its, act, chs-1, gapdh, tub2, cylh3, gs and apmat gene regions) to test whether different species are present and identified: c. karstii (2 isolates), c. gloeosporioides (1), c. siamense (7), c. syzygicola (6), colletotrichum sp (5), and c. guajavae (4), as the cause of anthracnose on small cardamom for the first time. pathogenicity of the six species was confirmed. to our knowledge, this is the first detailed study of colletotrichum species which cause anthracnose diseases on small cardamom. we have designed two taxon‐selective primers for the internal transcribed spacer (its) region in the nuclear ribosomal repeat unit. these primers, its1‐f and its4‐b, were intended to be specific to fungi and basidiomycetes, respectively. we have tested the specificity of these primers against 13 species of ascomycetes, 14 of basidiomycetes, and 15 of plants. our results showed that its4‐b, when paired with either a ‘universal’ primer its1 or the fungal‐specific primer its1‐f, efficiently amplified dna from all basidiomycetes and discriminated against ascomycete dnas. the results with plants were not as clearcut. the its1‐f/its4‐b primer pair produced a small amount of pcr product for certain plant species, but the quantity was in most cases less than that produced by the ‘universal’ its primers. however, under conditions where both plant and fungal dnas were present, the fungal dna was amplified to the apparent exclusion of plant dna. its1‐f/its4‐b preferential amplification was shown to be particularly useful for detection and analysis of the basidiomycete component in ectomycorrhizae and in rust‐infected tissues. these primers can be used to study the structure of ectomycorrhizal communities or the distribution of rusts on alternate hosts.
the complete nucleotide sequences of the genomes of dengue-1 virus virulent 45az5 pdk-o and attenuated vaccine candidate strain 45az5 pdk-27 have been determined and compared with the dengue-1 virus western pacific (west pac) 74 parent strain from which 45az5 pdk-o was derived. twenty-five (0.23%) nucleotide and 10 (0.29%) amino acid substitutions occurred between parent strain dengue-1 virus west pac 74 and virulent strain 45az5 pdk-o, which was derived from the parent by serial passage in diploid foetal rhesus lung (frhl-2) and mutagenized with 5-azacytidine. these substitutions were preserved in the 45az5 pdk-27 vaccine. 45az5 pdk-o and pdk-27 strains, which differ by 27 passages in primary dog kidney (pdk) cells, show 25 (0.23%) nucleotide and 11 (0.32%) amino acid divergences. these comparative studies suggest that the changes which occurred between the west pac 74 and 45az5 pdk-o strains may alter the biological properties of the virus but may not be important for attenuation. important nucleotide base changes responsible for attenuation accumulated between 45az5 pdk-o and 27. virion rnas of 12 geographically distinct dengue type 1 (den-1) virus isolates were clearly unique by rna fingerprinting. isolates from the same geographic area were very similar but differed from those of other areas, allowing us to establish three geographical groupings based upon percent shared oligonucleotides. three caribbean strains were virtually identical (85-91% homologous oligonucleotides) whereas pacific/s.e. asian strains exhibited considerably less homology to one another (44-49%). the pacific/s.e. asian strains exhibited little relationship (20-30%) to the caribbean and african strains. a sri lankan isolate displayed a relatively high degree of homology to nigerian isolates (60-66% homologous oligonucleotides), suggesting that the sri lanka den-1 infection originated from africa. a 1978 nigerian den-1 isolate and the 1969 sri lankan strain each exhibited greater than 50% homology with a 1977 jamaican strain. the similarities observed between the african/sri lankan and jamaican strains suggest that the den-1 virus which caused the 1977 jamaican epidemic may have originated from africa or sri lanka. the rna fingerprint is a unique characteristic of den-1 strains from a particular geographic region, suggesting this technique as a useful tool for dengue epidemiological investigations.
introductioncell stimulation leads to the shedding of phosphatidylserine (ps)-rich microparticles (mps). because autoimmune diseases (aids) are characterized by cell activation, we investigated level of circulating mps as a possible biomarker in primary sjögren's syndrome (pss), systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) and rheumatoid arthritis (ra).methodswe measured plasma levels of total, platelet and leukocyte mps by prothrombinase capture assay and flow cytometry in 43 patients with pss, 20 with sle and 24 with ra and in 44 healthy controls (hcs). secretory phospholipase a2 (spla2) activity was assessed by fluorometry. soluble cd40 ligand (scd40l) and soluble p-selectin (scd62p), reflecting platelet activation, were measured by elisa.resultspatients with pss showed increased plasma level of total mps (mean ± sem 8.49 ± 1.14 nm ps equivalent (eq), p < 0.0001), as did patients with ra (7.23 ± 1.05 n ps eq, p = 0.004) and sle (7.3 ± 1.25 nm ps eq, p = 0.0004), as compared with hcs (4.13 ± 0.2 nm ps eq). patients with aids all showed increased level of platelet mps (p < 0.0001), but only those with pss showed increased level of leukocyte mps (p < 0.0001). results by capture assay and flow cytometry were correlated. in patients with high disease activity according to extra-glandular complications (pss), das28 (ra) or sledai (sle) compared with low-activity patients, the mp level was only slightly increased in comparison with those having a low disease activity. platelet mp level was inversely correlated with anti-dna antibody level in sle (r = -0.65; p = 0.003) and serum β2 microglobulin level in pss (r = -0.37; p < 0.03). the levels of total and platelet mps were inversely correlated with spla2 activity (r = -0.37, p = 0.0007; r = -0.36, p = 0.002, respectively). scd40l and scd62p concentrations were significantly higher in pss than in hc (p ≤ 0.006).conclusionsplasma mp level is elevated in pss, as well as in sle and ra, and could be used as a biomarker reflecting systemic cell activation. level of leukocyte-derived mps is increased in pss only. the mp level is low in case of more severe aid, probably because of high secretory phospholipase a2 (spla2) activity, which leads to consumption of mps. increase of platelet-derived mps, scd40l and scd62p, highlights platelet activation in pss. objective to determine the cellular origin of synovial microparticles, their procoagulant properties, and their relationship to local hypercoagulation.   methods microparticles in synovial fluid and plasma from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra; n = 10) and patients with other forms of arthritis (non-ra; n = 10) and in plasma from healthy subjects (n = 20) were isolated by centrifugation. microparticles were identified by flow cytometry. the ability of microparticles to support coagulation was determined in normal plasma. concentrations of prothrombin fragment f(1+2) (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [elisa]) and thrombin-antithrombin (tat) complexes (by elisa) were determined as estimates of the coagulation activation status in vivo.   results plasma from patients and healthy controls contained comparable numbers of microparticles, which originated from platelets and erythrocytes. synovial microparticles from ra patients and non-ra patients originated mainly from monocytes and granulocytes; few originated from platelets and erythrocytes. synovial microparticles bound less annexin v (which binds to negatively charged phospholipids) than did plasma microparticles, exposed tissue factor, and supported thrombin generation via factor vii. f(1+2) (median 66 nm) and tat complex (median 710 microg/liter) concentrations were elevated in synovial fluid compared with plasma from the patients (1.6 nm and 7.0 microg/liter, respectively) as well as the controls (1.0 nm and 2.9 microg/liter, respectively).   conclusion synovial fluid contains high numbers of microparticles derived from leukocytes that are strongly coagulant via the factor vii-dependent pathway. we propose that these microparticles contribute to the local hypercoagulation and fibrin deposition in inflamed joints of patients with ra and other arthritic disorders.
purposethe aim of this study was to determine whether sense of coherence (soc) at baseline predicts health-related quality of life (hrqol) at 12–28-month follow-up among patients with coronary heart disease when controlled for sociodemographic and medical variables.methodsa total of 179 consecutive patients (58.28 ± 6.52 years, 16.8% women) scheduled for coronary angiography (cag) were interviewed before cag and 12–28 months after. soc was measured with the 13-item orientation to life questionnaire. hrqol was measured using the short form health survey 36 (sf-36), from which the mental and physical component summaries (mcs, pcs) were calculated. the relationship between soc and hrqol was examined using regression analyses.resultssoc proved to be a significant predictor of the mcs-score (b = 0.29; 95% ci = 0.17–0.41) and pcs-score (b = 0.18; 95% ci = 0.06–0.31) when not adjusted for possible confounding sociodemographic and medical variables. after adjustment for sociodemographic and medical variables, soc remained a predictor of the mcs-score (b = 0.26; 95% ci = 0.14–0.39). soc also remained a predictor of the pcs-score when controlled for gender, age and family income; however, the association disappeared after adjustment for functional status (b = 0.07; 95% ci = −0.05 to 0.19).conclusionssoc is a predictor of mental and physical hrqol at 12–28-month follow-up, crude and also after adjustment. patients undergoing cag with low soc thus deserve particular attention in regard to the maintenance and improvement of their hrqol. the attention to patient outcome has nowadays extended from morbidity and mortality to an aspect of patients' benefits in terms of quality of life. one factor crucial for quality of life is coping capacity, in this study represented by the sense of coherence concept. physical status and emotional state (often measured by comprehensive instruments not always suitable for clinical use) are also additionally used to reflect quality of life. the purpose was therefore to study sense of coherence and emotional state as indirect measures of quality of life in relation to coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. one hundred and eleven patients were studied by a developed questionnaire on five occasions in relation to the surgery: the week before the angiography, the day before surgery and then at 3, 6, and 12 months post-operatively. the main findings were: (1) the sense of coherence was changed (more than +/-10%) from before to 1 year after surgery in 41% of the patients, which is contrary to the theory of sense of coherence as a stable personality characteristic in adults. (2) experience of depressed mood, stress, and anxiety decreased significantly from before to after surgery. (3) beneficial outcome with regard to sense of coherence was significantly related to less experience of loneliness, depressed mood, stress and anxiety, and to less experience of chest pain 1 year after surgery. in conclusion, sense of coherence and emotional state variables, are suggested to be valuable as measurements of quality of life in relation to coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.
background obesity is characterized by a low grade chronic inflammation state. indeed circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tnf-α and il-6, are elevated in obese subjects, while anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as il-10, appear to be reduced. cytokines profile improves after weight loss, but how visceral or subcutaneous fat loss respectively affect pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines plasma levels has not been precisely assessed. therefore in the present study we correlated changes in circulating cytokine profile with quantitative changes in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue depots measured by an ad hoc magnetic resonance imaging (mri) protocol before and after weight loss. materials and methods in 14 obese subjects, mri determination of visceral and subcutaneous fat and plasma glucose, insulin, tnf-α il-6, and il-10 measurements were performed before and after a caloric restriction induced weight loss of at least 5% of the original body weight. results weight loss improved insulin sensitivity (quicki index: 0.35±0.03 vs 0.37±0.04; p<0.05), increased il-10 (3.4±1.9 vs 4.6±1.0 pg/ml; p<0.03), and reduced tnf-α and il-6 plasma levels (2.5±1.3 vs 1.6±1.5 pg/ml, p<0.0015, 2.3±0.4 vs 1.6±0.6 pg/ml, p<0.02 respectively). a significant correlation was observed between the amount of visceral fat loss and the percentage reduction in both tnf-α (r = 0.56, p<0.05) and il-6 (r = 0.19 p<0.05) plasma levels. in a multiple regression analysis, the amount of visceral fat loss independently correlated with the increase in il-10 plasma levels. conclusion the reduction in visceral adipose tissue is the main driver of the improved inflammatory profile induced by weight loss. the quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index (quicki) has an excellent linear correlation with the glucose clamp index of insulin sensitivity (si(clamp)) that is better than that of many other surrogate indexes. however, correlation between a surrogate and reference standard may improve as variability between subjects in a cohort increases (i.e., with an increased range of values). correlation may be excellent even when prediction of reference values by the surrogate is poor. thus, it is important to evaluate the ability of quicki to accurately predict insulin sensitivity as determined by the reference glucose clamp method. in the present study, we used a calibration model to compare the ability of quicki and other simple surrogates to predict si(clamp). predictive accuracy was evaluated by both root mean squared error of prediction as well as a more robust leave-one-out cross-validation-type root mean squared error of prediction (cvpe). based on data from 116 glucose clamps obtained from nonobese, obese, type 2 diabetic, and hypertensive subjects, we found that quicki and log (homeostasis model assessment [homa]) were both excellent at predicting si(clamp) (cvpe = 1.45 and 1.51, respectively) and significantly better than homa, 1/homa, and fasting insulin (cvpe = 3.17, p < 0.001; 1.67, p < 0.02; and 2.85, p < 0.001, respectively). quicki and log(homa) also had the narrowest distribution of residuals (measured si(clamp) - predicted si(clamp)). in a subset of subjects (n = 78) who also underwent a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test with minimal model analysis, quicki was significantly better than the minimal model index of insulin sensitivity (si(mm)) at predicting si(clamp) (cvpe = 1.54 vs. 1.98, p = 0.001). we conclude that quicki and log(homa) are among the most accurate surrogate indexes for determining insulin sensitivity in humans.
objective: the high number of cerebral palsy, the severe disability of this disorder, depression in disabilities, and long lasting effects of the childs disability on the family especially mothers are the common issues. the purpose of this study was investigating the level of depression in mothers with cerebral palsy children and its related factors. methods: this caused comparative study was carried out in tehran, in 2011. two groups of mothers with 4 to 12 years old healthy and cerebral palsy children were randomly selected to participate in this study. beck questionnaire was used to evaluate mothers' depression level. the relationship between variables was investigated by independent t- test and pearson's correlation. results: sixty mothers with cerebral palsy children and sixty mothers with normal children as control group were participated in the study. mean and standard deviation of age were 33.79± 6.02 in mothers and 7.11± 2.71 in children. depression of mothers with cerebral palsy child was significantly higher than control group and there was a significant correlation between depression of mothers with cerebral palsy children, and increasing caring time, dependency in activity of daily living and childrens gross and fine movements ability. discussion: although depression was higher in mothers with cerebral palsy children, the depression level of these mothers was affected by some factors related to the child issue. in order to decrease undesirable effects of having a cerebral palsy child, it is necessary to emphasize on childrens abilities to achieve maximum evolution potential and provide physical and mental protections for their mothers. purpose. disability in a child affects not only the child's life but also the family's life. the aim of our study is to verify the quality of life (qol) of mothers of disabled children with cerebral palsy (cp) with epilepsy compared with non-epilepsy children evaluated in a brazilian center. methods. thirty mothers of disabled children participated in the study. the control group comprised of 18 healthy mothers of children without disabilities. all mothers agreed to participate in the study. they completed the evaluation forms of the sf-36 health survey, a well-documented, self-administered qol scoring system. results. the results of our study support the premise that mothers of children with cp, as a group, have poorer qol than mothers of not disabled children. conclusions. we also observed that mothers of children with cp and epilepsy have poorer qol than mothers of children with cp without epilepsy.
organellar biogenesis is mainly regulated by nucleus-encoded factors, which act on various steps of gene expression including rna editing, processing, splicing, stabilization, and translation initiation. among these regulatory factors, pentatricopeptide repeat (ppr) proteins form the largest family of rna binding proteins, with hundreds of members in flowering plants. in striking contrast, the genome of the unicellular green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii encodes only 14 such proteins. in this study, we analyzed ppr7, the smallest and most highly expressed ppr protein in c. reinhardtii. green fluorescent protein-based localization and gel-filtration analysis revealed that ppr7 forms a part of a high-molecular-weight ribonucleoprotein complex in the chloroplast stroma. rip-chip analysis of ppr7-bound rnas demonstrated that the protein associates with a diverse set of chloroplast transcripts in vivo, i.e. rrns, psbh, rpoc2, rbcl, atpa, cema-atph, tsca, and atpi-psaj. furthermore, the investigation of ppr7 rnai strains revealed that depletion of ppr7 results in a light-sensitive phenotype, accompanied by altered levels of its target rnas that are compatible with the defects in their maturation or stabilization. ppr7 is thus an unusual type of small multifunctional ppr protein, which interacts, probably in conjunction with other rna binding proteins, with numerous target rnas to promote a variety of post-transcriptional events. abstract chloroplast translation is mediated by nucleus-encoded factors that interact with distinct cis-acting rna elements. a u-rich sequence within the 5′ untranslated region of the psbd mrna has previously been shown to be required for its translation inchlamydomonas reinhardtii. by using uv cross-linking assays, we have identified a 40-kda rna binding protein, which binds to the wild-type psbd leader, but is unable to recognize a nonfunctional leader mutant lacking the u-rich motif. rna binding is restored in a chloroplast cis-acting suppressor. the functions of several site-directed psbd leader mutants were analyzed with transgenic c. reinhardtii chloroplasts and the in vitro rna binding assay. a clear correlation between photosynthetic activity and the capability to bind rna by the 40-kda protein was observed. furthermore, the data obtained suggest that the poly(u) region serves as a molecular spacer between two previously characterized cis-acting elements, which are involved in rna stabilization and translation. rna-protein complex formation depends on the nuclear nac2 gene product that is part of a protein complex required for the stabilization of the psbdmrna. the sedimentation properties of the 40-kda rna binding protein suggest that it interacts directly with this nac2 complex and, as a result, links processes of chloroplast rna metabolism and translation.
to prolong the network lifetime, we propose an energy efficient chain-based routing scheme and a distributed algorithm for constructing the routing chain based on the minimum cost tree. the chain construction algorithm calculates the transmission cost based on optimal transmission power. therefore, it does not require global knowledge of location information of notes and provides more accurate communication cost calculation among nodes under different practical deployment environments. the proposed power aware mechanism for leader node election in the chain ensures more uniform energy consumption among nodes. the simulation shows the new scheme provides more uniform energy consumption among nodes and better active network lifetime in different network settings as compared to previous chain-based protocols. networking together hundreds or thousands of cheap microsensor nodes allows users to accurately monitor a remote environment by intelligently combining the data from the individual nodes. these networks require robust wireless communication protocols that are energy efficient and provide low latency. we develop and analyze low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (leach), a protocol architecture for microsensor networks that combines the ideas of energy-efficient cluster-based routing and media access together with application-specific data aggregation to achieve good performance in terms of system lifetime, latency, and application-perceived quality. leach includes a new, distributed cluster formation technique that enables self-organization of large numbers of nodes, algorithms for adapting clusters and rotating cluster head positions to evenly distribute the energy load among all the nodes, and techniques to enable distributed signal processing to save communication resources. our results show that leach can improve system lifetime by an order of magnitude compared with general-purpose multihop approaches.
the aim of this work was to evaluate the influence of elevating the cytosolic activity of phosphoglucomutase (pgm; ec 5.4.2.2) on photosynthesis, growth and heterotrophic metabolism. here we describe the generation of novel transgenic plants expressing an escherichia coli phosphoglucomutase (ecpgm) under the control of the 35s promoter. these lines were characterised by an accumulation of leaf sucrose, despite displaying no alterations in photosynthetic carbon partitioning, and a reduced tuber starch content. determinations of the levels of a wide range of other metabolites revealed dramatic reductions in maltose and other sugars in leaves of the transformants, as well as a modification of the pattern of organic and amino acid content in tubers of these lines. intriguingly, the transgenics also displayed a dramatically delayed rate of sprouting and significantly enhanced rate of respiration, however, it is important to note that the severity of these traits did not always correlate with the level of transgene expression. these results are discussed in the context of current understanding of the control of respiration and the breaking of tuber dormancy. patatin is one of the major soluble proteins in potato tubers and is encoded by a multigene family. based on structural considerations two classes of patatin genes are distinguished. the 5′‐upstream regulatory region of a class i gene contained within a 1.5 kb sequence is essential and sufficient to direct a high level of tuber‐specific gene activity which was on average 100‐ to 1000‐fold higher in tubers as compared to leaf, stem and roots in greenhouse grown transgenic potato plants when fused to the β‐glucuronidase reporter gene. histochemical analysis revealed this activity to be present in parenchymatic tissue but not in the peripheral phellem cells of transgenic tubers. furthermore the promoter fragment can be activated in leaves under conditions that simulate the need for the accumulation of starch in storage organs, i.e. high levels of sucrose. the expression is restricted to both mesophyll and epidermal cells in contrast to vascular tissue or hair cells.
cytochrome c(1) (cyt-c(1)) and the rieske iron sulphur protein (isp) are subunits of the cytochrome bc(1) complex located in the mitochondria functioning both as a proton pump and an electron transporter. vertebrate model organism phylogenies were used in conjunction with existing 3d protein structures to evaluate the biochemical evolution of cyt-c(1) and isp in terms of selection on amino acid properties. we found selection acting on the exterior surfaces of both proteins and specifically the core region of cyt-c(1). there is evidence supporting coevolution of these proteins relative to alpha helical tendencies, compressibility and equilibrium constant. the sensitivity of the commonly used progressive multiple sequence alignment method has been greatly improved for the alignment of divergent protein sequences. firstly, individual weights are assigned to each sequence in a partial alignment in order to down-weight near-duplicate sequences and up-weight the most divergent ones. secondly, amino acid substitution matrices are varied at different alignment stages according to the divergence of the sequences to be aligned. thirdly, residue-specific gap penalties and locally reduced gap penalties in hydrophilic regions encourage new gaps in potential loop regions rather than regular secondary structure. fourthly, positions in early alignments where gaps have been opened receive locally reduced gap penalties to encourage the opening up of new gaps at these positions. these modifications are incorporated into a new program, clustal w which is freely available.
the degradation of lignocellulosic materials requires the synergy of multiple enzymes. synergistic fermentation would be an alternative to a complete enzyme system and consequentially enhance enzymatic production. the present study used cellulolytic fungus of penicillium decumbens, aspergillus niger c112, and trichoderma reesei rutc-30 as the starting strains, to screen for the best combination and proportion of synergistic fermentation. the experiments of different combinations and inoculum ratios for synergistic fermentation were performed, and box-behnken designs were adopted to optimize the fermentation conditions. the best combination of strains was confirmed as t. reesei rutc-30 and p. decumbens with an 8:2 inoculum ratio. the maximum sugar concentration was 1.48 g/l with cmcase (17.53 u/ml) and fpase (4.78 u/ml) in this situation. response surface methodology revealed the optimized parameters as a substrate concentration of 5.93% at 32.12 °c, and a fermentation time of 5.85 d with a predicted sugar concentration of 2.91 g/l. under these conditions, a maximum sugar production of 2.96 g/l was achieved in verification experiments. a cellulase production process was developed by growing the fungi trichoderma reesei and aspergillus phoenicis on dairy manure. t. reesei produced a high total cellulase titer (1.7 filter paper units [fpu]/ml, filter paper activity) in medium containing 10 g/l of manure (dry basis [w/w]), 2 g/l kh2po4, 2 ml/l of tween-80, and 2mg/l of cocl2. however, β-glucosidase activity in the t. reesei-enzyme system was very low. t. reesei was then cocultured with a. phoenicis to enhance the β-glucosidase level. the mixed culture resulted in a relatively high level of total cellulase (1.54 fpu/ml) and β-glucosidase (0.64 iu/ml). the ratio of β-glucosidase activity to filter paper activity was 0.41, suitable for hydrolyzing manure cellulose. the crude enzyme broth from the mixed culture was used for hydrolyzing the manure cellulose, and the produced glucose was significantly (p<0.01) higher than levels obtained by using the commercial enzyme or the enzyme broth of the pure culture t. reesei.
background and purpose— after stroke, maximal voluntary force is reduced in the arm and hand muscles, and upper-limb strength training is 1 intervention with the potential to improve function. methods— we performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. electronic databases were searched from 1950 through april 2009. strength training articles were assessed according to outcomes: strength, upper-limb function, and activities of daily living. the standardized mean difference (smd) was calculated to estimate the pooled effect size with random-effect models. results— from the 650 trials identified, 13 were included in this review, totaling 517 individuals. a positive outcome for strength training was found for grip strength (smd=0.95, p=0.04) and upper-limb function (smd=0.21, p=0.03). no treatment effect was found for strength training on measures of activities of daily living. a significant effect for strength training on upper-limb function was found for studies including subjects with moderate (smd=0.45, p=0.03) and mild (smd=0.26, p=0.01) upper-limb motor impairment. no trials reported adverse effects. conclusions— there is evidence that strength training can improve upper-limb strength and function without increasing tone or pain in individuals with stroke. purpose: this paper reviews the mechanisms underlying the inability to generate force in individuals with stroke and summarizes the effects of strength training in these individuals. in addition, a systematic review of studies that have incorporated progressive strengthening interventions in individuals with stroke is presented. summary of key points: central (e.g., motor recruitment) and peripheral (e.g., muscle atrophy) sources may alter muscle strength in individuals with stroke and further investigations are needed to partition and quantify their effects. as to the effect of strength training interventions in individuals with stroke, the majority of studies (albeit with small samples) that evaluated muscle strength as an outcome demonstrated improvements. with regard to the effect of strength training on functional outcomes in individuals with stroke, positive outcomes were found in less rigorous pre-test/post-test studies, but more conflicting results with controlled trials. conclusions: although there is some suggestion that strength training alone can improve muscle strength, further research is required to optimize strength training and the transfer of these strength gains to functional tasks in individuals with stroke.
the influence of parent-child conflict and stressful experiences on the health of youth with asthma by erin therese tobin may 2013 advisor: dr. richard slatcher major: psychology (clinical) degree: master of arts attaining a clear picture of everyday family interactions is essential for understanding how family stress and conflict adversely affects children’s health, especially in the context of chronic illness. using a naturalistic observation sampling method called the electronically activated recorder (ear), we sought to investigate the effects of daily interpersonal conflicts and parental stress on pediatric asthma outcomes. we collected data from 81 children, aged 10 to 17 (m age = 12.88), and their primary caregiver as part of a larger study. each child completed a pulmonary function test and self-report questionnaires of asthma symptoms. asthma-related medical information was abstracted from their medical records. the adult and parent ucla life stress interview (lsi) assessed acute stress as the number of acutely stressful events in the past 6 months. of these 81 participants, 45 children wore the ear for 4 days. trained research assistants coded the ear files using the everyday child home observations (echo) coding system for instances of interpersonal conflict (e.g., arguing, fighting, yelling) and asthma symptoms (e.g., coughing, wheezing). ear-observed parent-child conflict (r = .36, p ear-observed family environment conflict (r = .32, p youth reported asthma symptoms. further, ear-observed wheezing coded was positively two hypotheses were tested: (a) one mechanism contributing to the high rate of disorder in children of women with affective disorders is elevated exposure to stressful events and conditions and (b) the children of depressed women, particularly women with unipolar depression, contribute to event occurrence because of increased interpersonal conflict. life stress interview assessments were made at 6-month intervals for 3 years on 53 children of unipolar, bipolar, medically ill, and normal women. both hypotheses were confirmed. transactional models of risk and further studies of the interpersonal functioning of children at risk for depression are needed.
spinal disk herniation can induce radicular pain through chemical irritation caused by proinflammatory and immune responses. bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (bmscs) are a unique type of adult stem cell with the functions of suppressing inflammation and modulating immune responses. this study was undertaken to observe the effect of intrathecal bmscs on the treatment of mechanical allodynia and the suppression of microglial activation in a rat noncompressive disk herniation model. the model was induced by the application of nucleus pulposus (np) to the l5 dorsal root ganglion (drg). the study found that the use of np in the drg can induce abnormal mechanical pain, increase the contents of the proinflammatory factors tnf-α and il-1β, decrease the content of the anti-inflammatory cytokine tgf-β1 and activate microglia in the spinal dorsal horns (l5) (p < 0.05). bmsc administration could increase the mechanical withdrawal thresholds dramatically, decrease the contents of il-1β and tnf-α, increase the content of tgf-β1 significantly (p < 0.05) and inhibit microglial activation in the bilateral spinal dorsal horn. our results indicate that bmsc administration can reduce mechanical allodynia and downregulate the expression of proinflammatory cytokines by inhibiting microglial activation in the spinal dorsal horn in a rat noncompressive disk herniation model. study design. autologous nucleus pulposus obtained from coccygeal intervertebral discs was grafted on the proximal of l5 dorsal root ganglion. pain behavior, mrna expression of interleukin-8 (il-8), and immunohistochemical changes were assessed. objective. the purpose of this study is to investigate temporal changes of il-8 expression in the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion and the pain-related behaviors with time course and to elucidate whether repertaxin (il-8 receptor inhibitor) attenuates pain-related behaviors in a rat model of lumbar disc herniation. summary of background data. inflammatory mediators like cytokines and chemokines have been implicated in radicular pain because of disc herniation. il-8, known as cxcl8, is a chemokine, which has been reported to be associated with painful degenerative disc disorders and chronic inflammatory pain states. methods. lumbar disc herniated rat model was made by implantation of the autologous nucleus pulposus, harvested from the coccygeal vertebra of each tail, on the left l5 nerve root just proximal to thedorsal root ganglion. rats were tested for mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia at 2 days before surgery, and on days 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 postoperatively. experimental group was intrathecally injected with the il-8 receptor inhibitor at l5 level on postoperative day 10. mechanical allodynia of the plantar surface of both hindpaw was tested on 30 minutes, 1, 3 hours, 1, 3, 5, and 10 days after administration. for the staining of astrocytes and microglia, immunohistochemical study was done 20 days after surgery. results. mechanical allodynia in ipsilateral hindpaw developed 1 day after surgery and lasted until 60 days and thermal withdrawal latency decreased significantly on the ipsilateral side 10 days after surgery and gradually increased through day 60. the il-8 receptor inhibitor attenuated the mechanical allodynia caused by nucleus pulposus when it was administered on postoperative day 10 and reduced microglial activation and phosphorylated form of mitogen-activated protein kinase (perk) expression in the spinal dorsal horn. conclusion. il-8 might be a potential therapeutic target in chronic radicular neuropathic pain because of disc herniation, cxcl8 inhibitor could be one of its promising therapeutic agents.
exposure to household phthalates has been reported to have adverse effects on children's health. in this paper, we used phthalate metabolites in the first morning urine as indicators of household phthalate exposures and examined their associations with residential characteristics, lifestyles and dietary habits among young children. during 2013-2014, we collected morning urines from children aged 5-10years in shanghai, china and obtained the related information about analyzed factors in this study by questionnaires. urinary phthalate metabolites were analyzed by isotope dilution-high performance liquid chromatography (hplc)-heated electrospray ionization source (hesi) coupled with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. anova, the mann-whitney or kruskai-wallis rank tests, and multivariate linear regression analyses were used to examine the target associations. ten metabolites of seven phthalates in 434 urine samples were analyzed. the detection rates of eight metabolites (mibp, mnbp, mehp, mecpp, mehhp, meohp, mep, and mmp) were >90%, except for mbzp (51.2%), and mchp with <10.0% of detection rate was not included in analyses. by multivariate linear regression analyses, factors significantly associated with higher concentrations of metabolites included non-usage household air cleaners (mep and mehp), changing the child's pillowcase less than one time a week (dehp metabolites), dusting furniture in the child's bedroom less than three times a week (mmp and mnbp), using more plastic toys (dehp metabolites and mep), often having soft drinks (dehp metabolites) and candies (mibp). our results indicated that phthalate exposures were common among shanghai children and residential characteristics had less significant associations with urinary phthalate metabolites compared with lifestyles and dietary habits. using less plastic toys, having less candies and soft drinks, using household air cleaner, as well as frequently changing the child's pillowcase and dusting furniture in the child's bedroom could reduce phthalate exposures among children. phthalate esters (pes), bisphenol a (bpa), and parabens (pbs), which are used in numerous consumer products, are known for their endocrine disrupting properties. organophosphate chemicals (ops), which form the basis of the majority of pesticides, are known for their neurotoxic activity in humans. all of these chemicals are associated with health problems to which children are more susceptible. once they enter the human body, pes, bpa, pbs, and ops are metabolized and/or conjugated and finally excreted via urine. hence, human exposure to these substances is examined through a determination of the urinary concentrations of their metabolites. this study assessed the exposure of greek preschool-age children to pes, bpa, pbs, and ops by investigating the urinary levels of seven pes metabolites, six pbs, bpa, and six dialkyl phosphate metabolites in five-hundred samples collected from 4-year-old children, subjects of the "rhea" mother-child cohort in crete, greece. daily intake of endocrine disruptors, calculated for 4 year old children, was lower than the corresponding daily intake for 2.5 year old children, which were determined in an earlier study of the same cohort. in some cases the daily intake levels exceeded the u.s. environmental protection agency tolerable daily intake (tdi) values and the efsa reference doses (rfd) (e.g., for di-2-ethyl-hexyl phthalate, 3.6% and 1% of the children exceeded rfd and tdi, respectively). exposure was linked to three main sources: pes-bpa to plastic, pbs-diethyl phthalate to personal hygiene products, and ops to food.
amphibian metamorphosis is accompanied by extensive intestinal remodeling. this process, mediated by thyroid hormone (th) and its nuclear receptors, affects every cell type. gut remodeling in xenopus laevis involves epithelial and mesenchymal proliferation, smooth muscle thickening, neuronal aggregation, formation of intestinal folds, and shortening of its length by 75%. transgenic tadpoles expressing a dominant negative th receptor (trdn) controlled by epithelial-, fibroblast-, and muscle-specific gene promoters were studied. trdn expression in the epithelium caused abnormal development of virtually all cell types, with froglet guts displaying reduced intestinal folds, thin muscle and mesenchyme, absence of neurons, and reduced cell proliferation. trdn expression in fibroblasts caused abnormal epithelia and mesenchyme development, and expression in muscle produced fewer enteric neurons and a reduced inter-muscular space. gut shortening was inhibited only when trdn was expressed in fibroblasts. gut remodeling results from both cell-autonomous and cell-cell interactions. thyroid hormone controls remodeling of the tadpole intestine during the climax of amphibian metamorphosis. in 8 days, the xenopus laevis tadpole intestine shortens in length by 75%. simultaneously, the longitudinal muscle fibers contract by about the same extent. the radial muscle fibers also shorten as the diameter narrows. many radial fibers undergo programmed cell death. we conclude that muscle remodeling and contraction play key roles in the shortening process. shortening is accompanied by a temporary "heaping" of the epithelial cells into many layers at climax. cells that face the lumen undergo apoptosis. by the end of metamorphosis, when the epithelium is folded into crypts and villi, the epithelium is a single-cell layer once again. throughout this remodeling, dna replication occurs uniformly throughout the epithelium, as do changes in gene expression. the larval epithelial cells as a whole, rather than a subpopulation of stem cells, are the progenitors of the adult epithelial cells.
abstract cardiovascular responses were examined in seven healthy male subjects during 10 min of recovery in the upright or supine position following 5 min of upright cycle exercise at 80% peak oxygen uptake. an initial rapid decrease in heart rate (fc) during the early phase of recovery followed by much slower decrease was observed for both the upright and supine positions. the average fc at the 10th min of recovery was significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the supine position than in the upright position, while they were both significantly greater than the corresponding pre-exercise levels (each p < 0.05). accordingly, the amplitude of the high frequency (hf) component of r-r interval variability (by spectrum analysis) in both positions was reduced with a decrease in mean r-r interval, the relationship being expressed by a regression line – mean r-r interval = 0.006 × hf amplitude + 0.570 (r = 0.905, n = 28, p < 0.001). these results would suggest that the slower reduction in fc following the initial rapid reduction in both positions is partly attributable to a retardation in the restoration of the activity of the cardiac parasympathetic nervous system. post-exercise upright stroke volume (sv, by impedance cardiography) decreased gradually to just below the pre-exercise level, whereas post-exercise supine sv increased markedly to a level similar to that at rest before exercise. the resultant cardiac output (q˙c) and the total peripheral vascular resistance (tpr) in the upright and supine positions returned gradually to their respective pre-exercise levels in the corresponding positions. at the 10th min of recovery, both average sv and q˙c were significantly greater (each p < 0.005) in the supine than in the upright position, while average tpr was significantly lower (p < 0.05) in the supine than in the upright position. in contrast, immediately after exercise, mean blood pressure dropped markedly in both the supine and upright positions, and their levels at the 10th min of recovery were similar. therefore we concluded that arterial blood pressure is maintained relatively constant through various compensatory mechanisms associated with fc, sv, q˙c, and tpr during rest and recovery in different body positions. transitional changes in stroke volume, heart rate, and cardiac output resulting from head-up tilt were measured in healthy male subjects, using impedance cardiography. respiratory frequency, tidal volume, ventilation rate, end-tidal o2 and co2 tensions, o2 uptake, co2 output, and exchange ratio were also determined breath-by-breath. when the subject was tilted upward from a supine to an upright position, the stroke volume was decreased while the heart rate was increased. the time required to attain the steady state was shorter in the stroke volume change than in the heart rate. in addition, since the heart rate was not increased so high as to be inversely related to the stroke volume, the cardiac output decreased by tilting upward. the ventilation rate remained almost unchanged within a tilt angle of 60 degrees or so. thus, both the o2 and co2 fractions in expired air showed transitory changes. as the original body position was restored, the cardiac output was increased to the initial level, the tidal volume showing a transient increase. during the recovery process, pco2, in expired air increased and po2 decreased, showing that the change in cardiac output exceeded that in ventilation in quantity. the change in ventilation moreover, preceded that of expired pco2 by ca. 10 sec, suggesting that the enhancement of ventilation occurred through some agent(s) other than the chemical drive.
objective: the purpose of this research was to provide further criterion and construct validation of the pillbox test, a brief, ecologically valid measure designed to assess executive functioning(ef). method: participants were 179 older male veterans who completed the pillbox test as part of a neuropsychological evaluation. results: performance on the pillbox test differed significantly between patients with and without dementia, with total error scores of ≥5 and ≥7 showing similar levels of sensitivity and specificity at 67% and at or near 70%, respectively. hierarchical multiple regression analysis revealed that measures of ef predicted performance on the pillbox test above and beyond measures of processing speed, but not above and beyond measures in other cognitive domains. conclusions: findings suggest the pillbox test is a promising new performance-based measure of executive functioning that can discriminate between patients with and without dementia. studies indicate that executive functioning (ef) is a strong predictor of everyday function. however, assessment can be problematic as no single standardized instrument is known to measure all ef domains simultaneously. thus, the pillbox test was developed as a new measure tapping four ef factors through the real-time assessment of medication management, a complex instrumental activity of daily living. the pillbox test showed good criterion-related validity and was effective in differentiating graduated levels of executive dysfunction between a mixed neurological group, medical control group, and healthy community control group. this test also showed good convergent validity as it correlated significantly in expected directions with established ef measures in all four of selected ef domains and the direct assessment of functional status. finally, a receiver operator characteristic curve found a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 87.5%, suggesting that the pillbox test is a promising new ecological measure of ef.
the aerial parts of the plant are generated by groups of rapidly dividing cells called shoot apical meristems. to analyze cell behavior in these structures, we developed a technique to visualize living shoot apical meristems using the confocal microscope. this method, combined with green fluorescent protein marker lines and vital stains, allows us to follow the dynamics of cell proliferation, cell expansion, and cell differentiation at the shoot apex. using this approach, the effects of several mitotic drugs on meristem development were studied. oryzalin (depolymerizing microtubules) very rapidly caused cell division arrest. nevertheless, both cell expansion and cell differentiation proceeded in the treated meristems. interestingly, dna synthesis was not blocked, and the meristematic cells went through several rounds of endoreduplication in the presence of the drug. we next treated the meristems with two inhibitors of dna synthesis, aphidicolin and hydroxyurea. in this case, cell growth and, later, cell differentiation were inhibited, suggesting an important role for dna synthesis in growth and patterning. controlled gene expression in time and space is a powerful tool for the analysis of gene function during plant development. here, we report ethanol inducible gene expression in defined sub-domains of the shoot apical and floral meristems. for this, expression of an ethanol-regulated transcription factor, alcr, is restricted to precise domains using specific promoters. gene expression activation is followed using reporters under the control of the alca promoter, which responds to alcr only in the presence of the ethanol. we demonstrate that precise control of spatially limited gene expression can be achieved. the kinetics of reporter gene activation and inactivation following a pulse of ethanol induction shows that the system is dynamic and suitable for precise temporal control of expression. the system is both flexible and robust, permitting simultaneous expression of two genes in a given domain or, conversely, the expression of a gene in two separate domains. we also show that this strategy can be applied to mis-express genes with developmental roles, by manipulating expression of the shoot meristemless (stm) and cyclin d3;1 (cycd3;1) genes during plant development.
this study investigated the relationship between psychotherapeutic interventions and pharmacologic measures of pharmacotherapy treatment adherence in patients with bipolar i disorder, as well as the relationship between these measures and treatment outcome. subjects were participating in an ongoing maintenance treatment study. audiotaped therapy sessions were rated for frequency of psychotherapeutic interventions related to pharmacotherapy treatment adherence. pharmacologic measures of medication adherence were compared to the tape ratings as well as to treatment outcome. variability in log erythrocyte (rbc) lithium—a marker of probable nonadherence to the pharmacotherapy regimen—for individual patients correlated significantly with treatment adherence interventions scale ratings. this marker of nonadherence was significantly related to maintenance treatment outcome, as was variability of the serum lithium level/dose (l/d) ratio; however, no relationship was found between treatment adherence interventions scale ratings and outcome. background the effectiveness of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (maois) in tricyclic resistant depression has received surprisingly little systematic study.   method patients who failed to respond to sustained, adequate treatment with the tricyclic imipramine (mean maximum dosage = 260 mg/day) and interpersonal psychotherapy were withdrawn from imipramine and treated in a standardized, but open-label 6-week trial with either phenelzine (n = 4; 60 mg/day) or tranylcypromine (n = 36; mean = 38.5 mg/day) and continued interpersonal psychotherapy.   results forty of 42 patients (95%) completed the trial, of whom 23 (58%) responded to treatment. highly significant improvement was documented on measures of depression, reversed neurovegetative symptoms, and somatic symptoms. response was significantly correlated with severity of depression (pre-maoi score on the hamilton rating scale for depression), severity of a composite score of anergic and reversed neurovegetative features, and low levels of improvement during initial imipramine/interpersonal psychotherapy. of patients who met criteria for proposed subforms of anergic or atypical depression, 67% (18/27) responded (p less than .05); 77% (17/22) of patients who scored above the mean on the composite measure of anergic and reversed neurovegetative features responded (p less than .01).   conclusion these findings provide strong evidence of the utility of maois in tricyclic-resistant depression, especially in patients with features such as fatigue, volitional inhibition, motoric retardation, hypersomnia, and/or weight gain.
brain activity in medial prefrontal cortex (mpfc) during exposure to persuasive messages can predict health behavior change. this brain-behavior relationship has been linked to areas of mpfc previously associated with self-related processing; however, the mechanism underlying this relationship is unclear. we explore two components of self-related processing – self-reflection and subjective valuation – and examine coherent activity between relevant networks of brain regions during exposure to health messages encouraging exercise and discouraging sedentary behaviors. we find that objectively logged reductions in sedentary behavior in the following month are linked to functional connectivity within brain regions associated with positive valuation, but not within regions associated with self-reflection on personality traits. furthermore, functional connectivity between valuation regions contributes additional information compared to average brain activation within single brain regions. these data support an account in which mpfc integrates the value of messages to the self during persuasive health messaging and speak to broader questions of how humans make decisions about how to behave. although persuasive messages often alter people's self-reported attitudes and intentions to perform behaviors, these self-reports do not necessarily predict behavior change. we demonstrate that neural responses to persuasive messages can predict variability in behavior change in the subsequent week. specifically, an a priori region of interest (roi) in medial prefrontal cortex (mpfc) was reliably associated with behavior change (r = 0.49, p < 0.05). additionally, an iterative cross-validation approach using activity in this mpfc roi predicted an average 23% of the variance in behavior change beyond the variance predicted by self-reported attitudes and intentions. thus, neural signals can predict behavioral changes that are not predicted from self-reported attitudes and intentions alone. additionally, this is the first functional magnetic resonance imaging study to demonstrate that a neural signal can predict complex real world behavior days in advance.
we present preliminary analyses of 18 single nucleotide polymorphism markers (snps) for 106 bowhead whales from barrow and st. lawrence island. we find no evidence for disequilibrium, population substructure, or genetic variation associated with temporal spacing of whales in the migration. introduction we present here a preliminary examination of a small dataset of single nucleotide polymorphism markers (snps) obtained from samples from 126 bowhead whales (balaena mysticetus) from the bering-chukchi-beaufort seas region. these data were developed by morin et al. (2007), using the methods of morin and mccarthy (2007). primary analyses of these data are given by morin et al. (2007); we offer only some preliminary secondary examinations here. the main goal of our paper is to provide a first look at one analysis not provided by those authors related to a temporal lag autocorrelation feature found in microsatellite analysis of fall barrow samples (jorde et al., 2007; givens and ozaksoy, 2006; givens et al. 2007). we also confirm some basic findings of morin et al. (2007) using a slightly different set of samples and snp loci. we analyzed data for 18 snp loci from 106 bowhead whales. the samples were collected from three sites: barrow and the villages of savoonga and gambell on st. lawrence island (sli). the barrow data were all collected during the spring migration period. the savoonga and gambell data came from whales sampled during both the fall and spring migrations, as well as from baleen samples and whale skulls obtained from villagers and discards from historical aboriginal hunts. some adjustments were made to the raw data prior to analysis. in the original dataset there were 126 whales typed on 19 loci. first, 16 individuals were deleted from the dataset because they were found to be duplicates of whales already in the dataset. second, two fetuses from barrow and 2 fetuses from savoonga were deleted because data from their mothers were already in the dataset. third, one locus (bmys402m56) was deleted from the data set because it was sex-linked. table 1 shows the numbers of whales analyzed using the 18 remaining snps loci. 1 dept. of statistics, colorado state university, fort collins co 80523. 2 southwest fisheries science center, 8604 la jolla shores dr., la jolla ca 92037. 3 north slope borough dept. of wildlife management, po box 69, barrow ak 99723. this journal frequently contains papers that report values of f-statistics estimated from genetic data collected from several populations. these parameters, fst, fit, and fis, were introduced by wright (1951), and offer a convenient means of summarizing population structure. while there is some disagreement about the interpretation of the quantities, there is considerably more disagreement on the method of evaluating them. different authors make different assumptions about sample sizes or numbers of populations and handle the difficulties of multiple alleles and unequal sample sizes in different ways. wright himself, for example, did not consider the effects of finite sample size. the purpose of this discussion is to offer some unity to various estimation formulae and to point out that correlations of genes in structured populations, with which f-statistics are concerned, are expressed very conveniently with a set of parameters treated by cockerham (1 969, 1973). we start with the parameters and construct appropriate estimators for them, rather than beginning the discussion with various data functions. the extension of cockerham's work to multiple alleles and loci will be made explicit, and the use of jackknife procedures for estimating variances will be advocated. all of this may be regarded as an extension of a recent treatment of estimating the coancestry coefficient to serve as a mea-
methionine-enkephalin-arginine-phenylalanine (meap) introduced into the interstitium of the canine sinoatrial (sa) node by microdialysis interrupts vagal bradycardia. in contrast, raising endogenou... background: methionine-enkephalin-arginine-phenylalanine (meap) is an endogenous opiate derived from the c-terminal sequence of the larger precursor molecule proenkephalin. this heptapeptide is abundant in the myocardium and has significant vagolytic activity when infused systemically. meap interrupted vagal bradycardia when it was delivered directly into the sinoatrial node by local microdialysis. this study was conducted to determine the opioid receptor responsible for the vagolytic effect of meap. methods and results: microdialysis probes were placed in the sinoatrial node of mongrel dogs and perfused at 5 μl/min. increasing doses of meap were included in the nodal perfusate and approximately two thirds of the vagal bradycardia was inhibited with a maximal effect at 0.3 nmoles/μ,l and a half-maximal response near 0.1 nmoles/,ul. when deltorphin ii (a delta opioid receptor agonist) was infused into the sinoatrial node, more than 95% of the vagal bradycardia was eliminated at 0.3 nmoles/,ul with the half-maximal response near 0.1 nmoles/,l, indicating that deltorphin ii was more efficacious than meap. the maximal deltorphin ii and meap effects were both similarly reversed by the paired infusion of increasing doses of the 6 opiate receptor antagonist, naltrindole. selected, μ (endomorphin, super dalda) and κ (dynorphin, u50488) receptor agonists and,μ (ctap) and κ (norbni) receptor antagonists were completely ineffective in this system. conclusions: these data suggest that the vagolytic effect of meap involves the activation of delta opiate receptors within the sinoatrial node.
the promus element plus us post-approval study (pe-plus pas) was a prospective, open-label, multicenter, observational study designed to examine outcomes in everyday clinical practice in patients treated with everolimus-eluting, platinum-chromium promus element plus stents at 52 centers in the united states. this is the first report of results from this large study. the primary end point of the pe-plus pas was 12-month cardiac death or myocardial infarction in the more restricted population of "platinum-like" patients pooled from the pe-plus pas, pe-prove (promus element european post-approval study), and platinum workhorse/small vessel trials. additional clinical end points were tested in the overall pe-plus pas patient population. of the 2,683 patients enrolled in pe-plus pas, 70% were men, mean age was 64 years, 33% had diabetes, and 29% were "platinum-like." among the platinum-like patients, 12-month cardiac death or myocardial infarction was 1.8% (33 of 1,855) with an upper 1-sided 95% confidence interval of 2.3%, which was significantly less than the prespecified performance goal of 3.2% (pnoninferiority <0.001). in the overall pe-plus population, 12-month target vessel failure (defined as death, mi, or revascularization related to the target vessel) was 6.7% (170 of 2,554), cardiac death was 1.4% (37 of 2,554), mi was 1.1% (28 of 2,554), and arc-definite/probable stent thrombosis was 0.7% (19 of 2,554). a prespecified secondary end point of 12-month target vessel failure in diabetic patients demonstrated a rate of 4.2% (14 of 332) with an upper 1-sided 95% confidence interval of 6.03%, which was significantly less than the performance goal of 12.6% (pnoninferiority <0.001). in conclusion, in this large registry of unselected patients, coronary artery revascularization with the promus element plus everolimus-eluting stent demonstrates favorable results with low 1-year clinical event rates. writing committee members* glenn n. levine, md, facc, faha, chair, eric r. bates, md, facc, faha, vice chair*, james c. blankenship, md, facc, fscai, vice chair*, steven r. bailey, md, facc, fscai*, john a. bittl, md, facc, bojan cercek, md, facc, faha, charles e. chambers, md, facc, fscai, stephen g. ellis, md, facc*, robert a. guyton, md, facc*, steven m. hollenberg, md, facc*, umesh n. khot, md, facc*, richard a. lange, md, facc, faha, laura mauri, md, msc, facc, fscai*, roxana mehran, md, facc, faha, fscai*, issam d. moussa, md, facc, faha, fscai, debabrata mukherjee, md, facc, fscai, brahmajee k. nallamothu, md, facc, henry h. ting, md, facc, faha
instruction memoization is a promising technique to reduce the power consumption and increase the performance of future low-end/mobile multimedia systems. power and performance efficiency can be improved by reusing instances of an already executed operation. unfortunately, this technique may not always be worth the effort due to the power consumption and area impact of the tables required to leverage an adequate level of reuse. in this paper, we introduce and evaluate a novel way of understanding multimedia floating-point operations based on the fuzzy computation paradigm: performance and power consumption can be improved at the cost of small precision losses in computation. by exploiting this implicit characteristic of multimedia applications, we propose a new technique called tolerant memoization. this technique expands the capabilities of classic memoization by associating entries with similar inputs to the same output. we evaluate this new technique by measuring the effect of tolerant memoization for floating-point operations in a low-power multimedia processor and discuss the trade-offs between performance and quality of the media outputs. we report energy improvements of 12 percent for a set of key multimedia applications with small lut of 6 kbytes, compared to 3 percent obtained using previously proposed techniques. power dissipation and thermal issues are increasingly significant in modern processors. as a result, it is crucial that power/performance tradeoffs be made more visible to chip architects and even compiler writers, in addition to circuit designers. most existing power analysis tools achieve high accuracy by calculating power estimates for designs only after layout or floorplanning are complete. in addition to being available only late in the design process, such tools are often quite slow, which compounds the difficulty of running them for a large space of design possibilities. this paper presents wattch, a framework for analyzing and optimizing microprocessor power dissipation at the architecture-level. wattch is 1000x or more faster than existing layout-level power tools, and yet maintains accuracy within 10% of their estimates as verified using industry tools on leading-edge designs. this paper presents several validations of wattch's accuracy. in addition, we present three examples that demonstrate how architects or compiler writers might use wattch to evaluate power consumption in their design process. we see wattch as a complement to existing lower-level tools; it allows architects to explore and cull the design space early on, using faster, higher-level tools. it also opens up the field of power-efficient computing to a wider range of researchers by providing a power evaluation methodology within the portable and familiar simplescalar framework.
purpose to assess the association between statins and diverse adverse events in japanese population. methods new users of statin who started statin after 6-month period of non-use were identified in 68 hospitals between january 2008 and july 2010. in addition to the random sample subcohort, we selected additional subcohort members to make the stratified sample subcohort have at least one patient in all subgroups stratified by each combination of statin and hospital. by abstraction from medical records, detailed information was obtained for all potential cases and pre-selected subcohort members. the event review committee consisting of 3 specialists judged whether possible cases met the definition of one of the adverse events of interest, and for adjudicated cases the committee further judged whether statin was a certain, probable or possible cause of the occurrence of the event. adjusted for covariates including age, gender, status of “switcher”, use of high daily dose and comorbidities at baseline, hazard ratio (hr) was estimated by the cox proportional hazards model with barlow’s weighting method. data were also analyzed by the method proposed by breslow in 2009. results a total of 6,877 new users of a statin were identified (median age: 66 years; males: 52%). the hazard ratios of increase in serum creatinine for atorvastatin and fluvastatin have wide confidence intervals, but both of the point estimates were around 2.5. estimates of hazard ratios by the method of barlow (1999) were similar to those by the method of breslow (2009). conclusions use of statin was not associated with a significant increased risk for renal, liver and muscle events. however, the hazard ratio of increase in serum creatinine tended to be high with atorvastatin and fluvastatin to require further studies. case-cohort data analyses often ignore valuable information on cohort members not sampled as cases or controls. the atherosclerosis risk in communities (aric) study investigators, for example, typically report data for just the 10%-15% of subjects sampled for substudies of their cohort of 15,972 participants. remaining subjects contribute to stratified sampling weights only. analysis methods implemented in the freely available r statistical system (http://cran.r-project.org/) make better use of the data through adjustment of the sampling weights via calibration or estimation. by reanalyzing data from an aric study of coronary heart disease and simulations based on data from the national wilms tumor study, the authors demonstrate that such adjustment can dramatically improve the precision of hazard ratios estimated for baseline covariates known for all subjects. adjustment can also improve precision for partially missing covariates, those known for substudy participants only, when their values may be imputed with reasonable accuracy for the remaining cohort members. links are provided to software, data sets, and tutorials showing in detail the steps needed to carry out the adjusted analyses. epidemiologists are encouraged to consider use of these methods to enhance the accuracy of results reported from case-cohort analyses.
purposewe conducted a secondary qualitative analysis of consultations between oncologists and their patients to explore how patient-reported outcome measures (proms) data were referred to in the process of (1) eliciting and exploring patients’ concerns; (2) making decisions about supportive treatment and (3) making decisions about chemotherapy and other systemic treatments.methodswe purposively sampled audio recordings of 18 consultations from the intervention arm and 4 from the attention control arm of a previous uk randomised controlled trial of the feedback of proms data to doctors (velikova et al. in j clin oncol 22(4):714–724 [1]). we used a combination of content and conversation analysis to examine how opportunities for discussion of health-related quality of life issues are opened up or closed down within the consultation and explore why this may or may not lead to changes in patient management.findingsexplicit reference to the proms data provided an opportunity for the patient to clarify and further elaborate on the side effects of chemotherapy. high scores on the proms data were not explored further if the patient indicated they were not a problem or were not related to the cancer or chemotherapy. symptomatic treatment was more often offered for problems like nausea, constipation, pain and depression but much less so for fatigue. doctors discussed fatigue by providing a cause for the fatigue (e.g. the chemotherapy), presenting this as ‘something to be expected’, minimising its impact or moving on to another topic. chemotherapy regimens were not changed on the basis of the proms data alone, but proms data were sometimes used to legitimise changes.conclusionsexplicit mention of proms data in the consultation may strengthen opportunities for patients to elaborate on their problems, but doctors may not always know how to do this. our findings have informed the development of a training package to enable doctors to optimise their use of proms data within the consultation. purpose to examine the effects on process of care and patient well-being, of the regular collection and use of health-related quality-of-life (hrql) data in oncology practice.   patients and methods in a prospective study with repeated measures involving 28 oncologists, 286 cancer patients were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (regular completion of european organization for research and treatment of cancer-core quality of life questionnaire version 3.0, and hospital anxiety and depression scale on touch-screen computers in clinic and feedback of results to physicians); attention-control group (completion of questionnaires, but no feedback); or control group (no hrql measurement in clinic before encounters). primary outcomes were patient hrql over time, measured by the functional assessment of cancer therapy-general questionnaire, physician-patient communication, and clinical management, measured by content analysis of tape-recorded encounters. analysis employed mixed-effects modeling and multiple regression.   results patients in the intervention and attention-control groups had better hrql than the control group (p =.006 and p =.01, respectively), but the intervention and attention-control groups were not significantly different (p =.80). a positive effect on emotional well-being was associated with feedback of data (p =.008), but not with instrument completion (p =.12). a larger proportion of intervention patients showed clinically meaningful improvement in hrql. more frequent discussion of chronic nonspecific symptoms (p =.03) was found in the intervention group, without prolonging encounters. there was no detectable effect on patient management (p =.60). in the intervention patients, hrql improvement was associated with explicit use of hrql data (p =.016), discussion of pain, and role function (p =.046).   conclusion routine assessment of cancer patients' hrql had an impact on physician-patient communication and resulted in benefits for some patients, who had better hrql and emotional functioning.
trees provide environmental benefits while vacant lots may pose environmental threats. citizen requests for street trees may indicate positive attitudes toward improving local environmental quality. each of these three indicators is evaluated to explore socio-spatial shifts and environmental variability using historic demographic data for new haven, ct. techniques include exploring bivariate correlations and performing ordinary least squares regressions with socio-economic data at the census block group scale. spatial lag and spatial error models are also estimated to control for and elucidate the spatial patterning. because present day built and environmental conditions are the result of former actions, historic socio-economic data help enumerate temporal lags that create landscape legacies. this methods paper suggests a presence of distributional inequity, and reveals that different socio-economic variables have varied temporal lags. in 2010 the american community survey (acs) replaced the long form of the united states decennial census. the acs is now the principal source of high-resolution geographic information about the u.s. population. the margins of error on acs census tract-level data are on average 75 percent larger than those of the corresponding 2000 long-form estimate. the practical implications of this increase is that data are sometimes so imprecise that they are difficult to use. this paper explains why the acs tract and block group estimates have large margins of error. statistical concepts are explained in plain english. acs margins of error are attributed to specific methodological decisions made by the census bureau. these decisions are best seen as compromises that attempt to balance financial constraints against concerns about data quality, timeliness, and geographic precision. in addition, demographic and geographic patterns in acs data quality are identified. these patterns are associated with demographic composition of census tracts. understanding the fundamental causes of uncertainty in the survey suggests a number of geographic strategies for improving the usability and quality acs.
background asthma and hyperreactive airway (hra) disease are a major cause of health resource utilization and poor quality of life worldwide; its prevalence in adults may widely vary according to the definition used. it is mainly a childhood disease, but its natural history till adulthood is not well known. this is due to other confounding factors such as smoking and environmental factors that may lead to misdiagnose asthma as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. correct and timely diagnosis of asthma and hra is important because it can be treated successfully and affected individuals may achieve good control of their disease.   objective to evaluate the prevalence of asthma and hra in lebanese adults, their symptoms and predictors.   methods a cross-sectional study using a multistage cluster sample was carried out in lebanon, between october 2009 and september 2010.lebanese residents aged 40 and above participated to the study; a post-bronchodilator spirometry was performed to confirm diagnosis.   results out of 2201 individuals, 218 (99%) were considered to have hra. the following factors were found associated with hra in the lebanese population: northern (ora: 3.54) and bekaa plain (ora: 2.44)] versus other regions; occupational exposure to toxic gases and fumes (ora: 2.08); heating home with wood (ora: 1.75); having a family history of chronic respiratory disease (ora: 2.19), a history of childhood lung problem (ora: 5.53), and father smoking during childhood (ora: 1.47). added to these factors, hra was also predicted by female gender (ora: 1.81); lower education (ora: 120); older age (ora: 1.28) and low birth weight (ora: 3.14).   conclusion this is the first epidemiological study in lebanon that determined physician diagnosed asthma prevalence and hyperreactive airway disease and their associated factors among lebanese adults. it also provides useful contributions that local health organizations may use for national programming and a foundation for health researchers to pursue further study in asthma research. public awareness about the increased risk of asthma associated with heating homes with wood and exposure to passive smoking should be raised; lebanese policy makers should also generate higher efforts to implement and reinforce the smoking ban law in public places. the aim of this study was to estimate the relative influence of genetic and environmental factors on the aetiology of asthma. the classic twin study design was used to analyse data on self-reported asthma obtained by a questionnaire mailed to 34,076 individuals, aged 12-41 yrs and originating from the danish twin register. the cumulative incidence of asthma was 6.2% in the pooled sample. the data showed a decreasing cumulative incidence with age for males, but no sex or zygosity difference was observed. substantially higher concordance rates, odds ratios and correlations for asthma were estimated in the monozygotic than in the dizygotic twins. using biometric modelling, a model including additive genetic and nonshared environmental effects provided the best overall fit to the data. according to this model, 73% of the variation in liability to asthma was explained by genetic factors. no sex difference or age-dependency in the magnitude of genetic effects was observed. the biometric analysis emphasized a major influence of genetic factors in the aetiology of asthma. however, a substantial part of the variation in liability to asthma is due to the impact of environmental factors specific to the individual. there is no evidence for a substantial impact of genetic dominance or the shared environment.
functional abdominal pain (fap) causes disruption of daily activities/missed school days, over utilization of healthcare, unnecessary surgeries, and anxiety in 10–15% of children. its etiology is not clearly understood, however the success of several clinical protocols suggests that autonomic dysregulation is a factor. in this study autonomic activity, including heart rate variability (hrv), was compared between children with fap and a comparison group. twenty children with fap and 10 children without fap between the ages of 5 and 17 years old were compared on autonomic regulation using an ambulatory system at baseline and 8 weeks later. children with fap participated in 6 sessions of hrv biofeedback aimed at normalizing autonomic balance. at baseline, children with fap appear to have more autonomic dysregulation than children without fap. after completing hrv biofeedback, the fap group was able to significantly reduce their symptoms in relation to significantly increasing their autonomic balance. in a sample of children with fap, it appears that hrv biofeedback treatment improved their symptoms and that a change in vagal tone was a potential mediator for this improvement. the present study appears to point to excessive vagal withdrawal as an underlying mechanism of fap. objective: to present current concepts about the diagnosis of recurrent abdominal pain and to review the basis of the therapeutic approach for this disease in children and adolescents. methods: references were obtained from the medline, from recent review articles, and from personal files. books and dissertations were also analyzed. only the most important articles were included in this review. results: recurrent abdominal pain is the main cause of recurrent pain in children between 4 and 16 years of age. it is defined as the occurrence of three or more abdominal pain attacks within 3 months or less. these attacks are severe enough to interrupt routine activities, making the child remain asymptomatic between the episodes of pain. the diagnosis is based on a detailed clinical history, on an improved physical examination, and on a few laboratory tests. it can be manifested with isolated paroxysms of umbilical pain, abdominal pain with dyspeptic symptoms, and abdominal pain with digestive tract dysfunction. the treatment must emphasize the cognitive-behavioral factors of the recurrent pain. conclusions: the treatment of recurrent abdominal pain using the strategy presented here represents an equilibrium in which time is neither wasted nor insufficient during the investigative process required for treating children and their families with this problem.
we evaluated the hypothesis that fatty acid reesterification would be increased during rest and exercise in the midluteal menstrual cycle phase and during oral contraceptive use, when ovarian hormone concentrations are high, compared with the early follicular phase. subjects were eight moderately active, weight-stable, eumenorrheic women (24.8 +/- 1.2 yr, peak oxygen consumption = 42.0 +/- 2.3 ml.kg(-1).min(-1)) who had not taken oral contraceptives for at least 6 mo. plasma free fatty acid (ffa) kinetics were assessed in the 3-h postprandial state by continuous infusion of [1-(13)c]palmitate and [1,1,2,3,3-(2)h]glycerol during 90 min of rest and 60 min of exercise at 45% and 65% peak oxygen consumption in the early follicular and midluteal menstrual cycle phases and during the inactive- and high-dose phases following 4 mo of oral contraceptive use. plasma ffa rates of appearance, disappearance, and oxidation increased significantly from rest to exercise with no differences noted between menstrual cycle or oral contraceptive phases or exercise intensities. compared with either menstrual cycle phase, oral contraceptive use resulted in an increase in plasma-derived fatty acid reesterification and a decrease in the proportion of plasma ffa rate of disappearance that was oxidized at rest and during exercise. endogenous and exogenous synthetic ovarian hormones do not exert a measurable influence on plasma ffa turnover or oxidation at rest or during moderate-intensity exercise in the 3-h postprandial state when carbohydrate use predominates. the increase in whole body lipolytic rate during exercise noted previously with oral contraceptive use is not matched by an increase in fatty acid oxidation and results in an increase in reesterification. synthetic ovarian hormones contained in oral contraceptives increase lipolytic rate, but fatty acid oxidation during exercise is determined by exercise intensity and its metabolic and endocrine consequences. arterial-venous concentration differences for individual free fatty acids (ffa) were measured across the deep tissues of the forearm, the splanchnic vascular bed, and the kidney in healthy, postabsorptive subjects. in addition, arterial-portal venous ffa differences were determined in five patients undergoing elective cholecystectomy. the differences in fractional uptake among the individual ffa across the forearm were small and not statistically significant. splanchnic fractional uptake was high for ffa with short chain lengths and rose with increasing degree of unsaturation. small, negative arterial-portal venous differences for individual ffa were observed, indicating that arterial-hepatic venous ffa differences mainly reflect hepatic uptake. when the arterial ffa concentration was reduced to approximately 25% of the control values by the administration of nicotinic acid, net uptake of total ffa ceased but there was release of stearic acid and uptake of lauric, myristic, and palmitoleic acid to the splanchnic region. muscle and liver uptakes of individual ffa were both dependent on their arterial concentrations with the exception of the splanchnic uptake of stearic acid. there was no uptake of free arachidonic acid by either muscle or liver, nor was there significant uptake of any of the free fatty acids by the kidney. it is concluded (a) that there are important quantitative differences between the net exchanges of individual ffa across the splanchnic vascular bed, (b) that tracer studies of ffa metabolism require the determination of individual ffa specific activities, (c) that palmitic and oleic acid appear to be suitable tracers for the entire ffa fraction in most instances.
diabetes mellitus is a growing problem in south africa and of concern to traditional african health practitioners in the nelson mandela metropole, because they experience a high incidence of diabetic cases in their practices. a collaborative research project with these practitioners focused on the screening of bulbine frutescens, ornithogalum longibracteatum, ruta graveolens, tarchonanthus camphoratus and tulbaghia violacea for antidiabetic and cytotoxic potential. in vitro glucose utilisation assays with chang liver cells and c2c12 muscle cells, and growth inhibition assays with chang liver cells were conducted. the aqueous extracts of bulbine frutescens (143.5%), ornithogalum longibracteatum (131.9%) and tarchonanthus camphoratus (131.5%) showed significant increased glucose utilisation activity in chang liver cells. the ethanol extracts of ruta graveolens (136.9%) and tulbaghia violacea (140.5%) produced the highest increase in glucose utilisation in c2c12 muscle cells. the ethanol extract of bulbine frutescens produced the most pronounced growth inhibition (33.3%) on chang liver cells. these findings highlight the potential for the use of traditional remedies in the future for the management of diabetes and it is recommended that combinations of these plants be tested in future. a tetrazolium salt has been used to develop a quantitative colorimetric assay for mammalian cell survival and proliferation. the assay detects living, but not dead cells and the signal generated is dependent on the degree of activation of the cells. this method can therefore be used to measure cytotoxicity, proliferation or activation. the results can be read on a multiwell scanning spectrophotometer (elisa reader) and show a high degree of precision. no washing steps are used in the assay. the main advantages of the colorimetric assay are its rapidity and precision, and the lack of any radioisotope. we have used the assay to measure proliferative lymphokines, mitogen stimulations and complement-mediated lysis.
the protooncogene c-myb is the cellular equivalent of the viral transforming oncogene v-myb. when human c-myb is constitutively expressed in balb/c3t3 cells it abrogates their absolute requirement for insulin-like growth factor 1 (igf-1). we show now, in two different cell lines, that the constitutive expression of the protooncogene c-myb causes an increase in both igf-1 and igf = 1 receptor mrna levels. this increase in mrna levels is due, at least in part, to an increase in the rate of transcription since, by run-on assay, cells carrying the human c-myb cdna show a 3-fold increase in transcriptional rates in comparison to the control parent cell lines. the increased expression of igf-1 receptor mrna also results in an increased number of igf-1 binding sites per cell. although some oncogenes have been described that are homologous to growth factors, or growth factor receptors, c-myb seems to represent a novel way of oncogene action inasmuch as it increases the expression of both a growth factor receptor and its ligand, thus establishing a quasi-autocrine mechanism which modifies the growth factor requirements of the cell and its growth regulation. complementary dnas encoding mouse liver insulin-like growth factor i (igf-i) have been isolated and sequenced. alternative rna splicing results in the synthesis of two types of mouse igf-i precursor that differ in the size and sequence of the cooh-terminal peptide. the sequences of the signal peptides, igf-i moieties and the first 16 amino acids of the cooh-terminal peptides or e-domains of the two precursors are identical. the sequence difference results from the presence in preproigf-ib mrna of a 52 base insertion which introduces a 17 amino acid segment into the cooh-terminal peptide of preproigf-ib and also causes a shift in the reading frame of the mrna. as a consequence of this insertion, the cooh-terminal 19 and 25 amino acids of mouse preproigf-ia and -ib, respectively, are different. the sequences of mouse and human preproigf-ia are highly conserved and possess 94% identity. in contrast, the sequences of mouse and human preproigf-ib are quite different in the region of the cooh-terminal peptide. a comparison of the sequences of mouse and human preproigf-ib mrna indicates that they are generated by different molecular mechanisms.
cellular differentiation relies on precise and controlled means of gene expression that act on several levels to ensure a flexible and defined spatio‐temporal expression of a given gene product. in our aim to identify transcripts enriched during fruiting body formation of the homothallic ascomycete aspergillus (emericella) nidulans, the grra gene could be identified in a negative subtraction hybridization screening procedure. it encodes a protein similar to fungal f‐box proteins, which function as substrate receptors for ubiquitin ligases, and that is highly related to the saccharomyces cerevisiae regulatory protein grr1p. expression studies confirmed induction of grra transcription and expression of its gene product during cleistothecial development of a. nidulans. functional complementation of a yeast grr1δ mutant was achieved by overexpression of the grra coding sequence. a grraδ deletion mutant resembles the wild‐type in hyphal growth, asexual sporulation, hülle cell formation or development of asci‐containing cleistothecia, but is unable to produce mature ascospores due to a block in meiosis as demonstrated by cytological staining of cleistothecial contents. our results specify a particular involvement of the e3 ubiquitin ligase scfgrra in meiosis and sexual spore formation of an ascomyceteous fungus and shed light on the diverse functions of ubiquitin‐proteasome‐mediated protein degradation in eukaryotic development. backgroundthe construction of cdna libraries is a useful tool to understand gene expression in organisms under different conditions, but random sequencing of unbiased cdna collections is laborious and can give rise to redundant est collections.we aimed to isolate cdnas of messages induced by switching aspergillus nidulans from growth on glucose to growth on selected polysaccharides. approximately 4,700 contigs from 12,320 ests were already available from a cdna library representing transcripts isolated from glucose-grown a. nidulans during asexual development. our goals were to expand the cdna collection without repeated sequencing of previously identified ests and to find as many transcripts as possible that are specifically induced in complex polysaccharide metabolism.resultswe have devised a negative subtraction hybridization (nsh) method and tested it in a. nidulans. nsh entails screening a plasmid library made from cdnas prepared from cells grown under a selected physiological condition with labeled cdna probes prepared from another physiological condition. plasmids with inserts that failed to hybridize to cdna probes through two rounds of screening (i.e. negatives) indicate that they are transcripts present at low concentration in the labeled probe pool. thus, these transcripts will be predominantly condition-specific, along with some rare transcripts.in a screen for transcripts induced by switching the carbon source from glucose to 12 selected polysaccharides, 3,532 negatives were isolated from approximately 100,000 surveyed colonies using this method. negative clones were end-sequenced and assembled into 2,039 contigs, of which 1,722 were not present in the previously characterized glucose-grown cdna library. single-channel microarray hybridization experiments confirmed that the majority of the negatives represented genes that were differentially induced by a switch from growth in glucose to one or more of the polysaccharides.conclusionsthe negative subtraction hybridization method described here has several practical benefits. this method can be used to screen any existing cdna library, including full-length and pooled libraries, and does not rely on pcr or sequence information. in addition, nsh is a cost-effective method for the isolation of novel, full-length cdnas for differentially expressed transcripts or enrichment of rare transcripts.
backgroundmicroscopy is unreliable to distinguish the pathogenic entamoeba histolytica from the nonpathogenic entamoeba dispar or entamoeba moshkovskii in stool specimens.methodsnested polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) was carried out to detect e. histolytica, e. dispar, and e. moshkovskii dna in stool samples of 202 patients positive for e. histolytica, e. dispar, or e. moshkovskii by microscopy or culture and in 35 controls. the techlab e. histolytica ii enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) was performed to detect gal/galnac lectin in 45 stool samples positive for e. histolytica, e. dispar, or e. moshkovskii by microscopy or culture. rapid-indirect hemagglutination assay (iha) was performed to detect serum antiamoebic antibodies in the 85 patients positive for e. histolytica, e. dispar, or e. moshkovskii in their stool specimens and in the 35 controls.resultsnested pcr-rflp was positive in 175 of 202 (86.6%) patient stool samples and was negative in all 35 negative control stool samples. elisa was positive in 29 of 45 (64.4%) patient stool samples. the iha test was positive in 19 of 85 (22.4%) patient serum samples and in one (2.8%) of the 35 control serum samples. nested pcr-rflp detected e. histolytica dna in stool specimens of 12 (63.2%) of 19 seropositive patients, and in 31 (47%) of 66 seronegative patients. techlab e. histolytica ii elisa detected e. histolytica antigen in stool specimens of six (54.5%) of 11 seropositive patients, and in 23 (67.6%) of 34 seronegative patients.conclusionsnested pcr-rflp was useful for the specific detection of e. histolytica, e. dispar, and e. moshkovskii in stool samples. a small number of entamoeba isolates from humans, the best known of which is the 'laredo' strain, have the ability to grow at room temperature. this peculiarity, along with other characteristics, distinguishes the strains from the human pathogen e. histolytica despite their being morphologically inseparable. in contrast, these 'e. histolytica-like' strains share several features with e. moshkovskii, which is most frequently isolated from polluted water. to examine the taxonomic relationships among these morphologically similar organisms, we have used polymerase chain reaction amplification of the small subunit ribosomal rna gene combined with restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, 'riboprinting'. the results clearly show that the 'e. histolytica-like' amoebae are indeed strains of e. moshkovskii, and not closely related to e. histolytica.
spin transfer torque magnetic random access memory (stt-mram) is a promising alternative to sram due to its low leakage and scalability advantages. in fact, although being more energy-efficient than sram, stt-mram caches at higher levels (e.g. l3) still incur a high energy consumption due to 1) high leakage in their read and write circuits and 2) high dynamic write energy in their bit-cells. to address this problem, we propose a novel normally-off stt-mram cache that exploits the fact that most applications access zero-byte patterns very frequently. in this architecture, writing of zero-bytes is avoided to reduce write energy. in addition, all read and write circuits are by default power gated (i.e. normally-off) to reduce leakage power. then, dynamically at runtime, only those circuits required for the ongoing operation are activated. our evaluations for an l3-cache of a multi-core microprocessor show that this approach reduces the energy consumption by 60% compared to state-of-the-art, while its impact on performance is negligible. spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memory (stt-mram) is a promising memory technology because of its advantageous features, such as nonvolatility, scalability, high density, zero-leakage, and cmos compatibility. however, one of its major drawbacks is the high overall energy consumption. to make matters even worse, the write process in stt-mram is of stochastic nature, i.e., the completion of a write operation is nondeterministic. however, if the read/write completion could be detected on the fly (i.e., dynamically) and the respective components could be turned-off immediately, the energy consumption can be reduced by a large extent. therefore, we propose a technique where the read and write completion signals are generated asynchronously on the fly using a self-timed bitwise technique. with this approach, the memory consumes power only when it is in the actual operational mode. experimental results show that this technique significantly reduces the energy consumption of read and write operations with negligible area overhead.
in the present study, we quantitatively described and compared lower extremity neuromuscular patterns during level cycling (lc), 10 and 20% uphill cycling (uc). we hypothesized that both the timing and intensity of activity of selected lower extremity muscles will differ between steep (but not moderate slope) uc condition and lc. twelve trained mountain bikers performed an experimental test with three different cycling conditions (level, 10% slope and 20% slope) with emg monitoring of eight lower extremity muscles. significant changes (p < 0.05) in muscle activation timing during 20% uc compared to lc (15° later onset and 39° earlier offset) were observed in m. rectus femoris (rf). range of activity during 20% uc compared to lc was also significantly (p < 0.05) modified in m. vastus medialis, m. vastus lateralis (8° and 5° shorter) and m. biceps femoris (bf; 17° longer). furthermore, a reduction of emg activity level was observed for rf and m. tibialis anterior (ta) during 20% uc compared to lc (25 and 19%; p < 0.05), while the opposite effect was observed for m. gluteus maximus (gm; 12%; p < 0.05). peak cross-correlation coefficients in all cycling conditions for all muscles were high (all coefficients ≥0.83). we have shown that altered body orientation during steep, but not moderate, slope uc significantly modified the timing and intensity of several lower extremity muscles, the most affected being those that cross the hip joint and ta. the observed modifications in neuromuscular patterns during 20% uc could have a significant effect on lower extremity joint kinetics and cycling efficiency. despite the wide use of surface electromyography (emg) to study pedalling movement, there is a paucity of data concerning the muscular activity during uphill cycling, notably in standing posture. the aim of this study was to investigate the muscular activity of eight lower limb muscles and four upper limb muscles across various laboratory pedalling exercises which simulated uphill cycling conditions. ten trained cyclists rode at 80% of their maximal aerobic power on an inclined motorised treadmill (4%, 7% and 10%) with using two pedalling postures (seated and standing). two additional rides were made in standing at 4% slope to test the effect of the change of the hand grip position (from brake levers to the drops of the handlebar), and the influence of the lateral sways of the bicycle. for this last goal, the bicycle was fixed on a stationary ergometer to prevent the lean of the bicycle side-to-side. emg was recorded from m. gluteus maximus (gm), m. vastus medialis (vm), m. rectus femoris (rf), m. biceps femoris (bf), m. semimembranosus (sm), m. gastrocnemius medialis (gas), m. soleus (sol), m. tibialis anterior (ta), m. biceps brachii (bb), m. triceps brachii (tb), m. rectus abdominis (ra) and m. erector spinae (es). unlike the slope, the change of pedalling posture in uphill cycling had a significant effect on the emg activity, except for the three muscles crossing the ankle's joint (gas, sol and ta). intensity and duration of gm, vm, rf, bf, bb, ta, ra and es activity were greater in standing while sm activity showed a slight decrease. in standing, global activity of upper limb was higher when the hand grip position was changed from brake level to the drops, but lower when the lateral sways of the bicycle were constrained. these results seem to be related to (1) the increase of the peak pedal force, (2) the change of the hip and knee joint moments, (3) the need to stabilize pelvic in reference with removing the saddle support, and (4) the shift of the mass centre forward.
the modeling of human movement is vital for a complete understanding of complex human–computer interaction. as three-dimensional collaborative tangible user interfaces (tuis) evolve, research is needed to understand how people physically interact with each other within a virtual environment. previous study of physical collaboration in virtual environments has utilized fitts' law to model gross upper-extremity movement in a passing task. however, no study has modeled passing tasks that require precision grasp with the human hand, an important feature of human–computer interaction in tuis. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the validity of fitts' law in modeling movement time for a precision passing task in a 3d tui, and to assess the coordination between passer and receiver using kinematic parameters. in this experiment, 12 participants (six male, mean age 22.6 years) performed a prehensile passing task within a desktop virtual environment. results detail the kinematic events required to achieve the necessary temporal and spatial coordination specific to the passing task. further, results indicate that fitts' model does not adequately explain movement time for this task (r 2 = .51). this finding challenges the external validity of previous results. we argue that the task-specific complexity of human neuromotor control should be considered when using predictive models in 3d tui design. earlier studies have suggested that the size of an object to be grasped influences the time taken to complete a prehensile movement. however, the use of cylindrical objects in those studies confounded the effects of object size — extent orthogonal to the reach axis — and object width — extent along the reach axis. in separating these effects, the present study demonstrates that movement time is not affected by manipulation of object size, as long as the latter does not approach the maximal object size that can be grasped. object width, on the other hand, is shown to exert a systematic influence on movement time: smaller object widths give rise to longer movement times through a lengthening of the deceleration phase of the movement, thus reproducing the effect of target width on the kinematics of aiming movements. as in aiming, movement amplitude also affects the movement time in prehension, influencing primarily the acceleration phase (i.e. peak velocity attained). the effects of object width and movement amplitude were found to combine in a way predicted by fitts' law, allowing a generalisation of the latter to the transport component in prehensile actions. with respect to the grasp component, both object size and object width are shown to affect peak hand aperture. increasing object width thus lowers the spatial accuracy demands on the transport component, permitting a faster movement to emerge. at the same time, the hand opens to a larger grip in order to compensate for eventual directional errors that result. finally, with respect to the control mode of the grasp component, it was found that peak finger closing velocity scales to distance to be covered, defined as the peak hand aperture minus object size.
associative classification is characterized by accurate models and high model generation time. most time is spent in extracting and postprocessing a large set of irrelevant rules, which are eventually pruned. we propose i‐prune, an item‐pruning approach that selects uninteresting items by means of an interestingness measure and prunes them as soon as they are detected. thus, the number of extracted rules is reduced and model generation time decreases correspondingly. a wide set of experiments on real and synthetic data sets has been performed to evaluate i‐prune and select the appropriate interestingness measure. the experimental results show that i‐prune allows a significant reduction in model generation time, while increasing (or at worst preserving) model accuracy. experimental evaluation also points to the chi‐square measure as the most effective interestingness measure for item pruning. © 2012 wiley periodicals, inc. previous studies propose that associative classification has high classification accuracy and strong flexibility at handling unstructured data. however, it still suffers from the huge set of mined rules and sometimes biased classification or overfitting since the classification is based on only a single high-confidence rule. the authors propose a new associative classification method, cmar, i.e., classification based on multiple association rules. the method extends an efficient frequent pattern mining method, fp-growth, constructs a class distribution-associated fp-tree, and mines large databases efficiently. moreover, it applies a cr-tree structure to store and retrieve mined association rules efficiently, and prunes rules effectively based on confidence, correlation and database coverage. the classification is performed based on a weighted /spl chi//sup 2/ analysis using multiple strong association rules. our extensive experiments on 26 databases from the uci machine learning database repository show that cmar is consistent, highly effective at classification of various kinds of databases and has better average classification accuracy in comparison with cba and c4.5. moreover, our performance study shows that the method is highly efficient and scalable in comparison with other reported associative classification methods.
in this thesis, we study methods to leverage information from fully-structured knowledge bases  (kbs), in particular the encyclopedic knowledge graph (kg) dbpedia, for different text-related  tasks from the area of information retrieval (ir) and natural language processing (nlp). the  key idea is to apply entity linking (el) methods that identify mentions of kb entities in text,  and then exploit the structured information within kgs. developing entity-centric methods for  text understanding using kg exploration is the focus of this work.    we aim to show that structured background knowledge is a means for improving performance in  different ir and nlp tasks that traditionally only make use of the unstructured text input itself.  thereby, the kb entities mentioned in text act as connection between the unstructured text and  the structured kg. we focus in particular on how to best leverage the knowledge as contained in  such fully-structured (rdf) kgs like dbpedia with their labeled edges/predicates – which is in  contrast to previous work on wikipedia-based approaches we build upon, which typically relies  on unlabeled graphs only. the contribution of this thesis can be structured along its three parts:    in part i, we apply el and semantify short text snippets with kb entities. while only retrieving  types and categories from dbpedia for each entity, we are able to leverage this information  to create semantically coherent clusters of text snippets. this pipeline of connecting text to  background knowledge via the mentioned entities will be reused in all following chapters.    in part ii, we focus on semantic similarity and extend the idea of semantifying text with entities  by proposing in chapter 5 a model that represents whole documents by their entities. in this  model, comparing documents semantically with each other is viewed as the task of comparing  the semantic relatedness of the respective entities, which we address in chapter 4. we propose  an unsupervised graph weighting schema and show that weighting the dbpedia kg leads to  better results on an existing entity ranking dataset. the exploration of weighted kg paths turns  out to be also useful when trying to disambiguate the entities from an open information extraction  (oie) system in chapter 6. with this weighting schema, the integration of kg information  for computing semantic document similarity in chapter 5 becomes the task of comparing the two  kg subgraphs with each other, which we address by an approximate subgraph matching. based  on a well-established evaluation dataset for semantic document similarity, we show that our unsupervised  method achieves competitive performance similar to other state-of-the-art methods.  our results from this part indicate that kgs can contain helpful background knowledge, in particular  when exploring kg paths, but that selecting the relevant parts of the graph is an important  yet difficult challenge.    in part iii, we shift to the task of relevance ranking and first study in chapter 7 how to best  retrieve kb entities for a given keyword query. combining again text with kb information, we  extract entities from the top-k retrieved, query-specific documents and then link the documents  to two different kbs, namely wikipedia and dbpedia. in a learning-to-rank setting, we study  extensively which features from the text, thewikipedia kb, and the dbpedia kg can be helpful  for ranking entities with respect to the query. experimental results on two datasets, which build  upon existing trec document retrieval collections, indicate that the document-based mention  frequency of an entity and the wikipedia-based query-to-entity similarity are both important  features for ranking. the kg paths in contrast play only a minor role in this setting, even when  integrated with a semantic kernel extension. in chapter 8, we further extend the integration of  query-specific text documents and kg information, by extracting not only entities, but also relations  from text. in this exploratory study based on a self-created relevance dataset, we find that  not all extracted relations are relevant with respect to the query, but that they often contain information  not contained within the dbpedia kg. the main insight from the research presented in  this part is that in a query-specific setting, established ir methods for document retrieval provide  an important source of information even for entity-centric tasks, and that a close integration of  relevant text document and background knowledge is promising.    finally, in the concluding chapter we argue that future research should further address the integration  of kg information with entities and relations extracted from (specific) text documents,  as their potential seems to be not fully explored yet. the same holds also true for a better kg  exploration, which has gained some scientific interest in recent years. it seems to us that both aspects  will remain interesting problems in the next years, also because of the growing importance  of kgs for web search and knowledge modeling in industry and academia. an

welsh (matthew.welsh@adelaide.edu.au) australian school of petroleum engineering, university of adelaide south australia, 5005, australia abstract modeling the semantic similarity between text docu- ments presents a significant theoretical challenge for cognitive science, with ready-made applications in in- formation handling and decision support systems deal- ing with text. while a number of candidate models exist, they have generally not been assessed in terms of their ability to emulate human judgments of simi- larity. to address this problem, we conducted an ex- periment that collected repeated similarity measures for each pair of documents in a small corpus of short news documents. an analysis of human performance showed inter-rater correlations of about 0.6. we then considered the ability of existing models—using word- based, n-gram and latent semantic analysis (lsa) approaches—to model these human judgments. the best performed lsa model produced correlations of about 0.6, consistent with human performance, while the best performed word-based and n-gram models achieved correlations closer to 0.5. many of the re- maining models showed almost no correlation with hu- man performance. based on our results, we provide some discussion of the key strengths and weaknesses of the models we examined. introduction modeling the semantic similarity between text docu- ments is an interesting problem for cognitive science, for both theoretical and practical reasons. theoret- ically, it involves the study of a basic cognitive pro- cess with richly structured natural stimuli. practically, search engines, text corpus visualizations, and a vari- ety of other applications for filtering, sorting, retriev- ing, and generally handling text rely fundamentally on similarity measures. for this reason, the ability to as- sess semantic similarity in an accurate, automated, and scalable way is a key determinant of the effectiveness of most information handling and decision support soft- ware that deals with text. a variety of different approaches have been devel- oped for modeling text document similarity. these in- clude simple word-based, keyword-based and n-gram measures (e.g., salton, 1989; damashek, 1995), and more complicated approaches such as latent seman- tic analysis (lsa: deerwester et al., 1990; landauer and dumais, 1997). while all of these approaches have achieved some level of practical success, they have gen- erally not been assessed in terms of their ability to model human judgments of text document similarity. the most likely reason for this failure is that no suit- able empirical data exist, and considerable effort is in- volved in collecting pairwise ratings of text document similarity for even a moderate number of documents. this paper reports the collection of data that give ten independent ratings of the similarity of every pair of 50 short text documents, and so represents an attempt to establish a ‘psychological ground truth’ for evaluating models. using the new data, we report a first eval- uation of the ability of word-based, n-gram and lsa approaches to model human judgments. experiment materials the text corpus evaluated by human judges contained 50 documents selected from the australian broadcast- ing corporation’s news mail service, which provides text e-mails of headline stories. the documents varied in length from 51 to 126 words, and covered a number of broad topics. a further 314 documents from the same were collected to act as a larger ‘backgrounding’ corpus for lsa. both document sets were assessed against a stan- dard corpus of five english texts using four models of language. these were the log-normal, generalized in- verse gauss-poisson (with γ = −0.5), yule-simon and zipfian models (baayen, 2001). both document sets were within the normal range of english text for word frequency spectrum and vocabulary growth and were therefore regarded as representative of normal english texts. subjects the subjects were 83 university of adelaide students (29 males and 54 females), with a mean age of 19.7 years. they were each paid with a ten (australian) dollar gift voucher for every 100 document pair ratings made.
factors identified in investigations of trait structure (e.g., the big five) are sometimes understood as explanations or sources of the covariation of distinct behavioral traits, as when extraversion is suggested to underlie the covariation of assertiveness and sociability. here, we detail how trait covariation can alternatively be understood as arising from units common to functionalist and process frameworks, such as self-efficacies, expectancies, values, and goals. specifically, the expected covariation between 2 behavioral traits should be increased when a specific process variable tends to indicate the functionality of both traits simultaneously. in 2 empirical illustrations, we identify a wide array of specific process variables associated with several big five-related behavioral traits simultaneously, and which are thus likely sources of their covariation. many of these, such as positive interpersonal expectancies, self-regulatory skills, and preference for order, relate similarly to a broad range of trait perceptions in both studies, and across both self- and peer-reports. we also illustrate how this understanding of trait covariation provides a somewhat novel explanation of why some traits are uncorrelated. as we discuss, a functionalist understanding of trait covariation as arising through functionalist or process variables has implications for many basic issues in personality psychology, such as how personality traits should be measured, mechanisms for personality stability and change, and the nature of personality traits more generally. in a large community sample (n=490), the big five were not orthogonal when modeled as latent variables representing the shared variance of reports from 4 different informants. additionally, the standard higher-order factor structure was present in latent space: neuroticism (reversed), agreeableness, and conscientiousness formed one factor, labeled stability, and extraversion and openness/intellect formed a second factor, labeled plasticity. comparison of two instruments, the big five inventory and the mini-markers, supported the hypotheses that single-adjective rating instruments are likely to yield lower interrater agreement than phrase rating instruments and that lower interrater agreement is associated with weaker correlations among the big five and a less coherent higher-order factor structure. in conclusion, an interpretation of the higher-order factors is discussed, including possible neurobiological substrates.
background leptospirosis is a zoonotic infectious disease that affects both humans and animals. the existing genetic tools for leptospira spp. have improved our understanding of the biology of this spirochete as well as the interaction of pathogenic leptospires with the mammalian host. however, new tools are necessary to provide novel and useful information to the field. methodology and principal findings a series of promoter-probe vectors carrying a reporter gene encoding green fluorescent protein (gfp) were constructed for use in l. biflexa. they were tested by constructing transcriptional fusions between the lipl41, leptospiral immunoglobulin-like a (liga) and sphingomielynase 2 (sph2) promoters from l. interrogans and the reporter gene. liga and sph2 promoters were the most active, in comparison to the lipl41 promoter and the non-induced controls. the results obtained are in agreement with liga expression from the l. interrogans fiocruz l1-130 strain. conclusions the novel vectors facilitated the in vitro evaluation of l. interrogans promoter activity under defined growth conditions which simulate the mammalian host environment. the fluorescence and rt-pcr data obtained closely reflected transcriptional regulation of the promoters, thus demonstrating the suitability of these vectors for assessing promoter activity in l. biflexa. computational methods for automated genome annotation are critical to understanding and interpreting the bewildering mass of genomic sequence data presently being generated and released. a neural network model of the structural and compositional properties of a eukaryotic core promoter region has been developed and its application for analysis of the drosophila melanogaster genome is presented. the model uses a time-delay architecture, a special case of a feed-forward neural network. the structure of this model allows for variable spacing between functional binding sites, which is known to play a key role in the transcription initiation process. application of this model to a test set of core promoters not only gave better discrimination of potential promoter sites than previous statistical or neural network models, but also revealed indirectly subtle properties of the transcription initiation signal. when tested in the adh region of 2.9 mbases of the drosophila genome, the neural network for promoter prediction (nnpp) program that incorporates the time-delay neural network model gives a recognition rate of 75% (69/92) with a false positive rate of 1/547 bases. the present work can be regarded as one of the first intensive studies that applies novel gene regulation technologies to the identification of the complex gene regulation sites in the genome of drosophila melanogaster.
principal cells (type iv units) in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (dcn) are uniquely sensitive to (are inhibited by) energy minima or notches in acoustic spectra, which provide cues to sound localization. the once accepted conceptual model of the dcn suggested that this sensitivity was shaped largely by inhibitory inputs from wideband inhibitors (wbis), which received auditory nerve inputs over a wide frequency range and inhibited type iv units over a narrow frequency range. a computational model based on this wide-input narrow-output conceptual model was able to reproduce quantitatively type iv unit responses to notch-noise stimuli as a function of notch width. recent physiological results have shown however that wbis are unresponsive to notch-noise stimuli with wide notch widths and thus have narrower auditory nerve fiber input bandwidths than previously assumed. a computational model based on a narrow-input narrow-output model of the wbi was unable to account fully for the notch sensitivity of type iv units suggesting the need to add a new component to the dcn circuit. the goal of this study was to test whether making the output bandwidth of the wbis wide while keeping their input bandwidth narrow could explain the responses of type iv units to notch-noise stimuli. anatomical evidence supports this model configuration, and the results show that such a model can produce strong inhibition in type iv units for wide notches. the results thus suggest that wbis, in narrow-input wide-output form, are sufficient to account for the notch sensitivity of dcn type iv units. this paper presents a computational model to simulate normal and impaired auditory-nerve (an) fiber responses in cats. the model responses match physiological data over a wider dynamic range than previous auditory models. this is achieved by providing two modes of basilar membrane excitation to the inner hair cell (ihc) rather than one. the two modes are generated by two parallel filters, component 1 (c1) and component 2 (c2), and the outputs are subsequently transduced by two separate functions. the responses are then added and passed through the ihc low-pass filter followed by the ihc-an synapse model and discharge generator. the c1 filter is a narrow-band, chirp filter with the gain and bandwidth controlled by a nonlinear feed-forward control path. this filter is responsible for low and moderate level responses. a linear, static, and broadly tuned c2 filter followed by a nonlinear, inverted and nonrectifying c2 transduction function is critical for producing transition region and high-level effects. consistent with kiang's two-factor cancellation hypothesis, the interaction between the two paths produces effects such as the c1/c2 transition and peak splitting in the period histogram. the model responses are consistent with a wide range of physiological data from both normal and impaired ears for stimuli presented at levels spanning the dynamic range of hearing.
background we investigated mtor regulation of gene expression by studying rapamycin effect in two hepatic cell lines, the non-tumorigenic wb-f344 cells and the tumorigenic wb311 cells. the latter are resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of rapamycin, thus providing us with an opportunity to study the gene expression effects of rapamycin without confounding effects on cell proliferation. methodology/principal findings the hepatic cells were exposed to rapamycin for 24 hr. microarray analysis on total rna preparations identified genes that were affected by rapamycin in both cell lines and, therefore, modulated independent of growth arrest. further studies showed that the promoter regions of these genes included e-box-containing transcription factor binding sites at higher than expected rates. based on this, we tested the hypothesis that c-myc is involved in regulation of gene expression by mtor by comparing genes altered by rapamycin in the hepatic cells and by c-myc induction in fibroblasts engineered to express c-myc in an inducible manner. results showed enrichment for c-myc targets among rapamycin sensitive genes in both hepatic cell lines. however, microarray analyses on wild type and c-myc null fibroblasts showed similar rapamycin effect, with the set of rapamycin-sensitive genes being enriched for c-myc targets in both cases. conclusions/significance there is considerable overlap in the regulation of gene expression by mtor and c-myc. however, regulation of gene expression through mtor is c-myc-independent and cannot be attributed to the involvement of specific transcription factors regulated by the rapamycin-sensitive mtor complex 1. the gene expression omnibus (geo) project was initiated in response to the growing demand for a public repository for high-throughput gene expression data. geo provides a flexible and open design that facilitates submission, storage and retrieval of heterogeneous data sets from high-throughput gene expression and genomic hybridization experiments. geo is not intended to replace in house gene expression databases that benefit from coherent data sets, and which are constructed to facilitate a particular analytic method, but rather complement these by acting as a tertiary, central data distribution hub. the three central data entities of geo are platforms, samples and series, and were designed with gene expression and genomic hybridization experiments in mind. a platform is, essentially, a list of probes that define what set of molecules may be detected. a sample describes the set of molecules that are being probed and references a single platform used to generate its molecular abundance data. a series organizes samples into the meaningful data sets which make up an experiment. the geo repository is publicly accessible through the world wide web at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo.
s of invited talks performance optimization of 5g mobile networks we consider the optimal energy-aware control of a single server in a server farm. the server is modeled as an m/g/1 queue with a particular control policy that allows to put the server to a sleep mode to save energy with an additional delay cost, the setup delay, after the server is turned on again. our main result is the derivation of mean response time for such a system under srpt scheduling. in particular, we show that the mean response time can be decomposed into two parts: the mean response time of an ordinary m/g/1-srpt, and an additional penalty term for switching the server to a sleep state. furthermore, we study the energy-performance optimization of the system and prove that, for the energy response time weighted sum (erws) and energy response time product (erp) cost metrics, the optimal control either puts the server into a sleep state immediately when it becomes idle or keeps it idling until the next job arrives.
objective the recognition of mental illness without anticipating stigma might encourage adolescents’ help-seeking behavior. we aimed to identify the relationship between mental illness identification and adolescents’ intention to seek help if faced with mental illness. method we examined the relationships between help-seeking intentions and recognition of mental illness (rmi) without correctly identifying the disease name, as well as correct labelling of schizophrenia (lsc) using a vignette about a person with schizophrenia in a cross-sectional survey of 9,484 japanese high-school students aged 15–18 years. results when compared with adolescents who were unable to recognize the mental illness (umi) in the vignette, those in the rmi group reported they were significantly more likely to seek help from friends (odds ratio [or] = 1.29; 95% confidence interval [ci] = 1.17–1.41; p < 0.001) and expressed an increased likelihood to seek help from professionals (all p < .05). those in the lsc group reported they were significantly less likely to exhibit help-seeking behavior (or = 0.77, 95% ci = 0.65–0.92, p = 0.003) and expressed an increased likelihood of help-seeking from health professionals than the umi group (all p < .05). conclusion the ability to recognize mental illness without identifying the disease may increase help-seeking from friends, while the ability to identify the disease as schizophrenia might decrease late adolescents’ help-seeking. to promote help-seeking behavior among adolescents, improving their ability to recognize mental illness generally is recommended. backgroundsurveys of the public in a number of countries have shown poor recognition of mental disorders and beliefs about treatment that often diverge from those of health professionals. this lack of mental health literacy can limit the optimal use of treatment services. australia and japan are countries with very different mental health care systems, with japan emphasising hospital care and australia more oriented to community care. japan is also more collectivist and australia more individualist in values. these differences might influence recognition of disorders and beliefs about treatment in the two countries.methodssurveys of the public were carried out in each country using as similar a methodology as feasible. in both countries, household interviews were carried out concerning beliefs in relation to one of four case vignettes, describing either depression, depression with suicidal thoughts, early schizophrenia or chronic schizophrenia. in australia, the survey involved a national sample of 3998 adults aged 18 years or over. in japan, the survey involved 2000 adults aged between 20 and 69 from 25 regional sites spread across the country.resultsthe japanese public were found to be more reluctant to use psychiatric labels, particularly for the depression cases. the japanese were also more reluctant to discuss mental disorders with others outside the family. they had a strong belief in counsellors, but not in gps. they generally believe in the benefits of treatment, but are not optimistic about full recovery. by contrast, australians used psychiatric labels more often, particularly "depression". they were also more positive about the benefits of seeking professional help, but had a strong preference for lifestyle interventions and tended to be negative about some psychiatric medications. australians were positive about both counsellors and gps. psychiatric hospitalization and ect were seen negatively in both countries.conclusionthere are some major differences between australia and japan in recognition of disorders and beliefs about treatment. some of these may relate to the different health care systems, but the increasing openness about mental health in australia is also likely to be an explanatory factor.
after a study of the hamiltonian group of gauge transformations, whose infinitesimal generators are the 14 first class constraints of a new formulation of canonical tetrad gravity on globally hyperbolic, asymptotically flat at spatial infinity, spacetimes with simultaneity spacelike hypersurfaces στ diffeomorphic to r3, the multitemporal equations associated with the constraints generating space rotations and space diffeomorphisms on the cotriads are given. their solutions give the dependence of the cotriads on στ and of their momenta on the six parameters associated with such transformations. the choice of 3-coordinates on στ , namely the gauge fixing to the space diffeomorphisms constraints, is equivalent to the choice of how to parametrize the dependence of the cotriad on the last three degrees of freedom: namely to the choice of a parametrization of the superspace of 3-geometries. the shanmugadhasan canonical transformation, corresponding to the choice of 3-orthogonal coordinates on στ and adapted to 13 of the 14 first class constraints, is found, the superhamiltonian constraint is rewritten in this canonical basis and the interpretation of the gauge transformations generated by it is given. some interpretational problems connected with dirac’s observables are discussed. in particular the gauge interpretation of tetrad gravity based on constraint theory implies that a “hamiltonian kinematical gravitational field” is an equivalence class of pseudo-riemannian spacetimes modulo the hamiltonian group of gauge transformations: it includes a conformal 3-geometry and all the different 4-geometries (standard definition of a kinematical gravitational field, riem m4/diff m4) connected to it by the gauge transfor- in the present article the geometry of semi-riemannian manifolds with nonholonomic constraints is studied. these manifolds can be considered as analogues to the sub-riemannian manifolds, where the positive definite metric is substituted by a nondegenerate metric. we study properties of the exponential map, the christoffel symbols and other differential operators are introduced. we study solutions of the hamiltonian system and their projections into the underlying manifold. the explicit formulae were found for a specific example of a semi-riemannian manifold with nonholonomic constraints.
lea proteins accumulate in plant seeds prior to maturation drying, and some have been shown to protect membranes from desiccation. this work demonstrates the subcellular distribution of each of 51 arabidopsis lea proteins and suggests protection against desiccation or cold stress is tailored for each cellular compartment. late embryogenesis abundant (lea) proteins are hydrophilic, mostly intrinsically disordered proteins, which play major roles in desiccation tolerance. in arabidopsis thaliana, 51 genes encoding lea proteins clustered into nine families have been inventoried. to increase our understanding of the yet enigmatic functions of these gene families, we report the subcellular location of each protein. experimental data highlight the limits of in silico predictions for analysis of subcellular localization. thirty-six lea proteins localized to the cytosol, with most being able to diffuse into the nucleus. three proteins were exclusively localized in plastids or mitochondria, while two others were found dually targeted to these organelles. targeting cleavage sites could be determined for five of these proteins. three proteins were found to be endoplasmic reticulum (er) residents, two were vacuolar, and two were secreted. a single protein was identified in pexophagosomes. while most lea protein families have a unique subcellular localization, members of the lea_4 family are widely distributed (cytosol, mitochondria, plastid, er, and pexophagosome) but share the presence of the class a α-helix motif. they are thus expected to establish interactions with various cellular membranes under stress conditions. the broad subcellular distribution of lea proteins highlights the requirement for each cellular compartment to be provided with protective mechanisms to cope with desiccation or cold stress. few organisms are able to withstand desiccation stress; however, desiccation tolerance is widespread among plant seeds. survival without water relies on an array of mechanisms, including the accumulation of stress proteins such as the late embryogenesis abundant (lea) proteins. these hydrophilic proteins are prominent in plant seeds but also found in desiccation-tolerant organisms. in spite of many theories and observations, lea protein function remains unclear. here, we show that leam, a mitochondrial lea protein expressed in seeds, is a natively unfolded protein, which reversibly folds into α-helices upon desiccation. structural modeling revealed an analogy with class a amphipathic helices of apolipoproteins that coat low-density lipoprotein particles in mammals. leam appears spontaneously modified by deamidation and oxidation of several residues that contribute to its structural features. leam interacts with membranes in the dry state and protects liposomes subjected to drying. the overall results provide strong evidence that leam protects the inner mitochondrial membrane during desiccation. according to sequence analyses of several homologous proteins from various desiccation-tolerant organisms, a similar protection mechanism likely acts with other types of cellular membranes.
ocular dominance in extrastriate visual cortex of cats with behaviorally defined strabismic amblyopia was studied using extracellular recording techniques. in area 18, the amblyopic eye drove about as many cells as the normal one. in area posteromedial lateral suprasylvian area (pmls), about 60% of the cells responded exclusively to stimulation of the normal eye and 30% to stimulation of the amblyopic eye. in area 21a more than 75% of the cells were monocularly driven by the non-amblyopic eye while only 5% were monocularly driven by the amblyopic eye. these findings suggest that ventral pathways (area 21a) are more affected in amblyopia than dorsal pathways (area pmls). abstract kittens are born with a large divergent strabismus. fourteen kittens observed daily from birth concurrently developed both visually guided behavior and normal interocular alignment during the second postnatal month. (interocular alignment is defined as the angle formed by the visual axes.) once achieved, this normal interocular alignment is resistant to a number if alterations in the cat's visual input. two cats with adult eyelid closure (one binocular, one monocular), 3 cats with adult unilateral visual cortex ablations, and 3 cats with adult transection of the optic chiasm along the sagittal midline did not develop strabismus. however, all 5 kittens reared with binocular eyelid closure and 9 of 10 reared with monocular eyelid closure developed a stable strabismus. the former all displayed a similar divergent strabismus whereas strabismus in the latter covered a wide range of interocular misalignments. a purely mechanical explanation is discarded sinceboth eyes of cats reared with monocular closure were similarly misaligned. these results indicate that cats require a normal, binocular visual environment during development to achieve the proper interocular alignment. it is hypothesized that during normal development, the binocular patterned visual input stimulates some part or parts of the cat's visual system to align the eyes properly. binocular closure results in no patterned stimulation, so the eyes remain diverged. monocular closure allows patterned stimulation through the open eye, and this initiates alignment which results in a wide range of errors due to the lack of data from the closed eye. apparently the visual system does not require the visual cortex for this alignment since 3 kittens reared with extensive visual cortex ablations made during the 8th postnatal day demonstrated the normal development of both visually guided behavior and interocular alignment.
the objective of this study is to examine the association of family-centered care (fcc) with specific health care service outcomes for children with special health care needs (cshcn). the study is a secondary analysis of the 2005–2006 national survey of children with special health care needs. receipt of fcc was determined by five questions regarding how well health care providers addressed family concerns in the prior 12 months. we measured family burden by reports of delayed health care, unmet need, financial costs, and time devoted to care; health status, by stability of health care needs; and emergency department and outpatient service use. all statistical analyses used propensity score-based matching models to address selection bias. fcc was reported by 65.6% of respondents (n = 38,915). fcc was associated with less delayed health care (aor: 0.56; 95% ci: 0.48, 0.66), fewer unmet service needs (aor: 0.53; 95% ci: 0.47, 0.60), reduced odds of ≥1 h/week coordinating care (aor: 0.83; 95% ci: 0.74, 0.93) and reductions in out of pocket costs (aor: 0.88; 95% ci: 0.80, 0.96). fcc was associated with more stable health care needs (aor: 1.11; 95% ci: 1.01, 1.21), reduced odds of emergency room visits (aor: 0.90; 95% ci: 0.82, 0.99) and increased odds of doctor visits (aor: 1.25; 95% ci: 1.14, 1.37). our study demonstrates associations of positive health and family outcomes with fcc. realizing the health care delivery benefits of fcc may require additional encounters to build key elements of trust and partnership. measurements of continuous variables are made in all branches of medicine, aiding in the diagnosis and treatment of patients. in clinical practice it is helpful to label individuals as having or not having an attribute, such as being “hypertensive” or “obese” or having “high cholesterol,” depending on the value of a continuous variable.  categorisation of continuous variables is also common in clinical research, but here such simplicity is gained at some cost. though grouping may help data presentation, notably in tables, categorisation is unnecessary for statistical analysis and it has some serious drawbacks. here we consider the impact of converting continuous data to two groups (dichotomising), as this is the most common approach in clinical research.1  what are the perceived advantages of forcing all individuals into two groups? a common argument is that it greatly simplifies the statistical analysis and leads to easy interpretation and presentation of results. a …
significance although scientists have identified surprising cognitive flexibility in animals and potentially unique features of human psychology, we know less about the selective forces that favor cognitive evolution, or the proximate biological mechanisms underlying this process. we tested 36 species in two problem-solving tasks measuring self-control and evaluated the leading hypotheses regarding how and why cognition evolves. across species, differences in absolute (not relative) brain volume best predicted performance on these tasks. within primates, dietary breadth also predicted cognitive performance, whereas social group size did not. these results suggest that increases in absolute brain size provided the biological foundation for evolutionary increases in self-control, and implicate species differences in feeding ecology as a potential selective pressure favoring these skills. cognition presents evolutionary research with one of its greatest challenges. cognitive evolution has been explained at the proximate level by shifts in absolute and relative brain volume and at the ultimate level by differences in social and dietary complexity. however, no study has integrated the experimental and phylogenetic approach at the scale required to rigorously test these explanations. instead, previous research has largely relied on various measures of brain size as proxies for cognitive abilities. we experimentally evaluated these major evolutionary explanations by quantitatively comparing the cognitive performance of 567 individuals representing 36 species on two problem-solving tasks measuring self-control. phylogenetic analysis revealed that absolute brain volume best predicted performance across species and accounted for considerably more variance than brain volume controlling for body mass. this result corroborates recent advances in evolutionary neurobiology and illustrates the cognitive consequences of cortical reorganization through increases in brain volume. within primates, dietary breadth but not social group size was a strong predictor of species differences in self-control. our results implicate robust evolutionary relationships between dietary breadth, absolute brain volume, and self-control. these findings provide a significant first step toward quantifying the primate cognitive phenome and explaining the process of cognitive evolution. class does not exist either, precisely since the relation between the two shadows compared is not a relation of simple comparison and common appurtenance to the same totality, but of substantial participation. the shadow perceived on the table is therefore no more an isolable object than is, on the sensorimotor plane, the watch which disappears under one cushion and which the child expects to see appear under another. but if there is thus an apparent return to the past it is for an opposite reason to that which obstructs objectification in sensorimotor intelligence; in the latter case the object is difficult to form in proportion as the child has difficulty in intercoordinating perceptual images, whereas on the plane of conceptual thought the object, already elaborated, again loses its identity to the extent that it is coordinated with other objects to construct a class or a relation. in conclusion, in the case of the object as in that of space, from the very beginnings of verbal reflection there is a return of the difficulties already overcome on the plane of action, and there is repetition, with temporal displacements, of the stages and process of adaptation defined by the transition from egocentrism to objectivity. and in both cases the phenomenon is due to the difficulties experienced by the child, after he has reached the social plane, in inserting his sensorimotor acquisitions in a framework of relationships of logical classes and deductive structures admitting of true generalisation, that is, taking into account the point of view of others and all possible points of view as well as his own. § 4. from sensori-motor universe to representation of the child’s world ii. causality and time the development of causality from the first months of life to the eleventh or twelfth year reveals the same graphic curve as that of space or object. the acquisition of causality seems to be completed with the formation of sensorimotor intelligence; in the measure that objectification and spatialisation of relations of cause and effect succeed the magico-phenomenalistic egocentrism of the primitive connections, a whole evolution resumes with the advent of speech and representative thought which seems to reproduce the preceding evolution before really extending it. but among the displacements to which this history of the concept of cause gives rise, distinction must again be made between the simple temporal displacements in extension due to the repetition of primitive processes on the occasion of new problems analogous to old ones, and the temporal displacements in comprehension due to the transition from one plane of activity to another; that is, from the plane of action to that of representation. it seems useless to us to emphasise the former. nothing is more natural than the fact that belief in the efficacy of personal activity, a belief encouraged by chance comparisons through immediate or phenomenalistic experience, is again found throughout childhood in those moments of anxiety or of desire which characterise infantile magic. the second type of temporal displacements, however, raises questions which it is useful to mention here. during the first months of life the child does not dissociate the external world from his own activity. perceptual images, not yet consolidated into objects or coordinated in a coherent space, seem to him to be governed by his desires and efforts, though these are not attributed to a self which is separate from the universe. then gradually, as progress is made in the intelligence which elaborates objects and space by spinning a tight web of relations among these images, the child attributes an autonomous causality to things and persons and conceives of the existence of causal relations independent of himself, his own body becoming a source among other sources of effects integrated in this total system. what will happen when, through speech and representative thought, the subject succeeds not only in foreseeing the development of phenomena and in acting upon them but in evoking them apart from any action in order to try to explain them? it is here that the paradox of displacement in comprehension appears. by virtue of the "why" obsessing the child’s mind, as soon as his representation of the world can be detached without too much risk of error, one perceives that this universe, centred on the self, which seemed abolished because it was eliminated from practical action relating to the immediate environment, reappears on the plane of thought and impresses itself on the little child as the sole understandable conception of totality. undoubtedly the child no longer behaves, as did the baby, as though he commanded everything and everybody. he knows that adults have their own will, that the rain, wind, clouds, stars, and all things are characterised by movements and effects he undergoes but cannot control. in short, on the practical plane, the objectification and spatialisation of causality remain acquired. but this does not at all prevent the child from representing the universe to himself as a large machine, organised exactly by whom he does not know, but organised with the help of adults and for the sake of the well-being of men and particularly of children. just as in a house everything is arranged according to a plan, despite imperfections and partial failures, so also the raison d’être for everything in the physical universe is the function of a sort of order in the world, an order both material and moral, of which the child is the center. adults are there "to take care of us," animals to do us service, the stars to warm us and give us light, plants to nourish us, rain to make the gardens grow, clouds to "make night," mountains to climb on, and lakes for boats, etc. furthermore, to this more or less explicit and coherent artificialism there corresponds a latent animism which endows everything with the will to play its role and with just the force and awareness needed to act with regularity. thus the causal egocentrism, which on the sensorimotor plane disappears gradually under the influence of spatialisation and objectification, reappears from the time of the beginnings of thought in almost as radical a form. doubtless the child no longer attributes personal causality to others or to things, but while endowing objects with specific activities he centers all these activities on man and above all on himself. it seems clear that in this sense we may speak of temporal displacement from one plane to another and that the phenomenon is thus comparable to the phenomena which characterise the evolution of space and object. but it is in a still deeper sense that the primitive schemata of causality are again transposed in the child’s first reflective representations. if it is true that from the second year of life the child attributes causality to others and to objects instead of reserving a monopoly on them for his own activity, we have still to discover how he represents to himself the mechanism of these causal relations. we have just recalled that corresponding to the egocentric artificialism which makes the universe gravitate around man and child is an animism capable of explaining the activity of creatures and things in this sort of world. this example is precisely of a kind to help us understand the second kind of temporal displacement of which we now speak: if the child renounces considering his actions as the cause of every event, he nevertheless is unable to represent to himself the action of bodies except by means of schemata drawn from his own activity. an object animated by a "natural" movement like the wind which pushes clouds, or the moon which advances, thus seems endowed with purposefulness and finality, for the child is unable to conceive of an action without a conscious goal. through lack of awareness, every process involving a relation of energies, such as the rising of the water level in a glass in which a pebble has been dropped, seems due to forces copied from the model of personal activity; the pebble "weighs" on the bottom of the water, it "forces" the water to rise, and if one held the pebble on a string midway of the column of the water the level would not change. in short, even though there is objectivity on the practical plane, causality may remain egocentric from the representative point of view to the extent that the first causal conceptions are drawn from the completely subjective consciousness of the activity of the self. with regard to spatialisation of the causal connection the same temporal displacement between representation and action is observable. thus the child can acknowledge in practice the necessity for a spatial contact between cause and effect, but that does not make causality geometric or mechanical. for example, the parts of a bicycle all seem necessary to the child long before he thinks of establishing irreversible causal series among them. however, subsequent to these primitive stages of representation during which one sees reappear on the plane of thought forms of causality relative to those of the first sensorimotor stages and which seem surpassed by the causal structures of the final stages of sensorimotor intelligence, one witnesses a truly reflective objectification and spatialisation, whose progress is parallel to that which we have described on the plane of action. thus it is that subsequent to the animism and dynamism we have just mentioned, we see a gradual "mechanism" taking form, correlative to the principles of conservation described in § 3 and to the elaboration of a relative space. causality, like the other categories, therefore evolves on the plane of thought from an initial egocentrism to a combined objectivity and relativity, thus reproducing, in surpassing, its earlier sensorimotor evolution. with regard to time, concerning which we have tried to describe on the purely practical plane of the first two years of life the transformation from
abstract. the aim of this study was to demonstrate the effect of excimer laser and balloon angioplasty of femoral artery stenosis and occlusion after use of a haemostatic puncture closure device. a haemostatic puncture closure device (angio-seal) was used in 6000 patients after diagnostic or therapeutic artery catheterisation. in 34 of those patients symptoms of peripheral artery disease occurred. sixteen of those 34 cases were transferred to our clinic for excimer laser angioplasty. all 16 patients presented with symptoms of acute peripheral artery disease within 1–14 days: superficial femoral artery (sfa) occlusions (4 cases); superficial femoral artery stenosis (3 cases); high-grade stenosis of the common femoral artery (cfa; 3 cases); high-grade stenosis of cfa; sfa and profund femoral artery (pfa; 3 cases); and occlusions of cfa, sfa and pfa (3 cases). before any procedure was performed, informed consent was given by the patient, which included the use of the angio-seal closure device. every patient who had to undergo recanalisation procedures gave additional informed consent which especially included the usage of the excimer laser for recanalisation. a measurement of the walking distance, ankle–brachial systolic pressure index (abi) and diagnostic angiography was performed in 13 cases before and immediate after as well as 3 and 6 months after therapeutic percutaneous transluminal laser angioplasty followed by balloon angioplasty (ptla/pta). in 3 patients the risks of ptla/pta was considered too high; those patients underwent surgical repair. angiographic and clinical improvement was achieved in 13 of 13 patients. the mean walking distance increased from 81 to >400 m. the average ankle–brachial systolic pressure index (abi) increased from 0.47 to 0.84. one patient developed a dissection of the sfa, and in 1 case a peripheral embolisation was seen. the ptla/pta technique is a successful therapeutic option for patients with femoral artery occlusion or high-grade stenosis after angio-seal application. purpose: given the increasing number of percutaneously applied endovascular therapies, the incidence of access-related vascular complications can be expected to rise, particularly in association with those techniques requiring large sheaths or anticoagulation. the need exists for a safe, easy to use, and effective hemostatic technique to replace the labor-intensive method of manual compression. methods: a bioabsorbable, sheath-delivered vascular closure device (angio-seal™) has been developed that deposits a small collagen plug within the arterial wall to mechanically seal the puncture defect. an anchor connected by suture to the plug is first deployed in the arterial lumen and pulled flush against the interior arterial wall to guard against intraluminal deposition of the collagen. results: the angio-seal device was deployed successfully in 80 (96%) of 83 attempts involving common femoral arteries accessed for peripheral angioplasty (n = 30), coronary angiography (n = 30), and coronary angioplasty (n = 16). three popliteal artery access sites and one femoropopliteal bypass graft were also treated. hemostasis was immediate in 78 cases (98%); 2 sites required a 5-minute manual compression to effect a secure seal. three devices failed to deploy, and manual pressure was used to close the puncture. nondeployment did not cause any sequelae, and no complications were encountered with the technique. conclusions: this novel vascular closure device is quick (< 1 minute application time) and simple to use, providing a positive seal of common femoral artery puncture sites for both peripheral and coronary interventions. it appears to be a reliable alternative to standard manual hemostasis.
field amplified sample stacking (fass) is used to increase sample concentrations in electrokinetic flows. the technique uses conductivity gradients to establish a non-uniform electric field that accumulates ions within a conductivity gradient, and can be readily integrated with capillary electrophoresis. conductivity gradients also cause gradients in near-wall electroosmotic flow velocities. these velocity gradients generate internal pressure gradients that drive secondary, dispersive flows. this dispersion leads to a significant reduction in the efficiency of sample stacking. this paper presents an experimental investigation of internally generated pressure gradients in fass using micron-resolution particle image velocimetry (μpiv). we measure velocity fields of particles seeded into an electrokinetic fass flow field in a glass microchannel with a single buffer–buffer interface. μpiv allows for the direct quantification of local, instantaneous pressure gradients by analyzing the curvature of velocity profiles. measurements show internally generated pressure-driven velocities on the order of 1mm/s for a typical applied electric field of 100 v/cm and a conductivity ratio of 10. a one-dimensional (1d) analytical model for the temporal development of the internal pressure gradient generation is proposed which is useful in estimating general trends in flow dynamics. in particle image velocimetry experiments where optical access is limited or in microscale geometries, it may be desirable to illuminate the entire test section with a volume of light, as opposed to a two-dimensional sheet of light. with volume illumination, the depth of the measurement plane must be defined by the focusing characteristics of the recording optics. a theoretical expression for the depth of the two-dimensional measurement plane is derived and it is shown to agree well with experimental observations. unfocused particle images, which lie outside the measurement plane, create background noise that decreases the signal-to-noise ratio of the particle-image fields. results show that the particle concentration must be chosen judiciously in order to balance the desired spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of the particle-image field.
in this paper, we investigate several automatic transcription schemes for using raw bilingual broadcast news data in semi-supervised bilingual acoustic model training. specifically, we compare the transcription quality provided by a bilingual asr system with another system performing language diarization at the front-end followed by two monolingual asr systems chosen based on the assigned language label. our research focuses on the frisian-dutch code-switching (cs) speech that is extracted from the archives of a local radio broadcaster. using 11 hours of manually transcribed frisian speech as a reference, we aim to increase the amount of available training data by using these automatic transcription techniques. by merging the manually and automatically transcribed data, we learn bilingual acoustic models and run asr experiments on the development and test data of the fame! speech corpus to quantify the quality of the automatic transcriptions. using these acoustic models, we present speech recognition and cs detection accuracies. the results demonstrate that applying language diarization to the raw speech data to enable using the monolingual resources improves the automatic transcription quality compared to a baseline system using a bilingual asr system. although phonetic lexicons are critical for many speech applications, the process of building one for a new language can take a significant amount of time and effort. we present a bootstrapping algorithm to build phonetic lexicons for new languages. our method relies on a large amount of unlabeled text, a small set of ’seed words’ with their phonetic transcription, and the proficiency of a native speaker in correctly inspecting the generated pronunciations of the words. the method proceeds by automatically building letter-to-sound (lts) rules from a small set of the most commonly occurring words in a large corpus of a given language. these lts rules are retrained as new words are added to the lexicon in an active learning step. this procedure is repeated until we have a lexicon that can predict the pronunciation of any word in the target language with the accuracy desired. we tested our approach for three languages: english,
ciliary neurotrophic factor (cntf), leukemia inhibitory factor (lif), cardiotrophin-1 (ct-1), and interleukin 6 (il-6) comprise a group of structurally related cytokines that promote the survival of subsets of neurons in the developing peripheral nervous system, but the signaling pathways activated by these cytokines that prevent neuronal apoptosis are unclear. here, we show that these cytokines activate nf-κb in cytokine-dependent developing sensory neurons. preventing nf-κb activation with a super-repressor iκb-α protein markedly reduces the number of neurons that survive in the presence of cytokines, but has no effect on the survival response of the same neurons to brain-derived neurotrophic factors (bdnf), an unrelated neurotrophic factor that binds to a different class of receptors. cytokine-dependent sensory neurons cultured from embryos that lack p65, a transcriptionally active subunit of nf-κb, have a markedly impaired ability to survive in response to cytokines, but respond normally to bdnf. there is increased apoptosis of cytokine- dependent neurons in p65 −/− embryos in vivo, resulting in a reduction in the total number of these neurons compared with their numbers in wild-type embryos. these results demonstrate that nf-κb plays a key role in mediating the survival response of developing neurons to cytokines. nf-kappa b, which consists of two polypeptides, p50 (m(r) 50k) and p65/rela (m(r) 65k), is thought to be a key regulator of genes involved in responses to infection, inflammation and stress. indeed, although developmentally normal, mice deficient in p50 display functional defects in immune responses. here we describe the generation of mice deficient in the rela subunit of nf-kappa b. disruption of the rela locus leads to embryonic lethality at 15-16 days of gestation, concomitant with a massive degeneration of the liver by programmed cell death or apoptosis. embryonic fibroblasts from rela-deficient mice are defective in the tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-mediated induction of messenger rnas for i kappa b alpha and granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (gm-csf), although basal levels of these transcripts are unaltered. these results indicate that rela controls inducible, but not basal, transcription in nf-kappa b-regulated pathways.
introductionthirteen patients presented with patellofemoral instability out of 3212 knees treated with kinematically aligned total knee arthroplasty (ka tka) during a nine year period. we determined the clinical characteristics and post-operative radiographic parameters associated with patellofemoral instability, and whether re-operation and patient reported outcome measures are different between patients with and without patellofemoral instability.methodspatients with patellofemoral instability were matched 1:3 to a control cohort based on date of surgery (±3 months), age (±10 years), sex, pre-operative knee deformity (varus or valgus), and implant brand. we analyzed clinical characteristics and seven post-operative radiographic parameters.resultspatellofemoral instability presented atraumatically (12 of 13) at 5 ± 4.7 months for a 0.4 % incidence at a mean follow-up of 43 ± 36 months. no pre-operative clinical characteristics were associated with instability. patients with patellofemoral instability had greater flexion of the femoral component (11° versus 5°; p = 0.0012), a trend toward greater external rotation of the tibial component (2° versus 0°; p = 0.2704), more reoperations (9 versus 0; p = 0.0026) and a lower oxford knee score (36 versus 42; p = 0.0045) than controls.discussionpatellofemoral instability after kinematically aligned tka is infrequent, presents atraumatically, and is associated with greater flexion of the femoral component than the control group.conclusionminimizing flexion of the femoral component might reduce the risk of patellofemoral instability by promoting early engagement of the patella in the trochlear during knee flexion. rotational mismatch of the tibial component on the femoral component within 0°±10° is associated with better function after mechanically aligned total knee arthroplasty (tka). kinematically aligned tka has gained interest; however, the percentage of kinematically aligned tka within 0°±10° is unknown. the authors prospectively followed all patients who underwent tka for primary osteoarthritis between december 2011 and april 2012 (194 patients, 195 knees). each underwent kinematically aligned tka with manual instruments. aligning the anteroposterior axis of the tibial component parallel to the line that bisects the oval boundary of the lateral tibial condyle set internal/external rotation. removing bone from the posterior femoral condyles equal in thickness to the femoral component after correction for cartilage wear set internal/external rotation and anteroposterior translation of the femoral component. rotational mismatch of the tibial component on the femoral component was determined from a computed tomography scan of the knee. ninety-seven percent of kinematically aligned tka with fixed-bearing components had a rotational mismatch within 0°±10° (overall range, -11° to 11°). this percentage was higher and the range narrower than the 85% of tka within 0°±10° and the -14° to 16° range reported for mechanically aligned tka. the use of manual instruments to kinematically aligned tka reliably limited rotational mismatch to within 0°±10°, which has been associated with better function.
backgroundmany researchers have examined the effect that mental health has on reemployment opportunities amongst the unemployed, but the results are inconclusive. our aim in this study is to investigate the effects that different aspects of mental and physical health, as well as socio-demographic, social, and economic factors, have on reemployment.methodsa questionnaire was administered to 1,000 and answered by 502 newly registered unemployed swedes, who were followed for one year using data from the swedish national labour market board. the differences between those reemployed and those not reemployed was analysed using stepwise logistic regression.resultsgeneral mental ill health amongst unemployed individuals measured by the general health questionnaire scale was associated with lower levels of reemployment after one year. this effect could not be explained by any of the scales measuring specific aspects of mental disease such as health-related level of function, rate of depression, burnout, or alcohol misuse. instead being above 45, low control over one’s financial situation, being an immigrant, and visiting a physician during the last three months were better predictors of failure to be reemployed.conclusionthere are theoretical reasons to assume that psychological distress leads to a decreased reemployment rate amongst the unemployed. the results of this study partly endorse this hypothesis empirically, showing that general subjective mental distress decreases the rate of reemployment amongst newly unemployed individuals, although this effect was mediated by social and economic factors. indicators of psychiatric disease had no significant effect on reemployment. the results of this study lead us to suggest the early introduction of financial counselling, psychological support, and other interventions for groups with lower reemployment rates. the center for epidemiologic studies-depression scale (ces-d; l. s. radloff, 1977) assesses the presence and severity of depressive symptoms occurring over the past week. although it contains only 20 items, its length may preclude its use in a variety of clinical populations. this study evaluated psychometric properties of 2 shorter forms of the ces-d developed by f. j. kohout, l. f. berkman, d. a. evans, and j. cornoni-huntley (1993): the iowa form and the boston form. data were pooled from 832 women representing 6 populations. internal consistency estimates, correlations with the original version of the ces-d, and omitted-included item correlations supported use of the iowa form over the boston form when a shortened version of the scale is desired. regression statistics are provided for use in estimating scores on the original ces-d when either shortened form is used. factor analytic results from two populations support a single-factor structure for the original ces-d as well as the short forms.
the biomechanical responses of 48 lumar motion segments exposed to loads similar to those in frontal car accidents were determined by means of a new method of applying dynamic (transient) flexion-shear loads. the applied loads caused flexion-distraction injuries in the specimens, so-called lap seat belt injuries. the peak values of the applied load pulses in the present experiments varied between 5-12 g, with a rise time between 5-30 ms and a duration between 150-250 ms. the specimens could withstand loads up to 225 nm and 720 n in flexion before obvious fractures occurred. signs of injury in the bony structure were observed at lower load levels. the results showed that the magnitude of the applied load pulse and the loading rate determined the degree and severity of spinal injury. the duration of the load pulse did not affect the load and injury response. the specimens could withstand higher loads and absorb more energy when the loading rate was increased, but the deformations at injury were smaller when the loading rate was high. the biological parameters bone mineral content, anterior- posterior length and height of the specimen showed high correlations with the dynamic load response of the lumbar spine. for the covering abstract of the conference see irrd 860654. the ultimate strength in flexion of 16 lumbar functional spinal units (fsu) was determined. the specimens were exposed to a combined static load of bending and shearing in the sagittal plane until overt rupture occurred (simulated flexion-distraction injuries). the biomechanical response of the fsu was measured with a force and moment platform. mechanical displacement gauges were used to measure vertical displacements (flexion angulation) of the specimens. photographs were taken after each loading step for determination of horizontal displacements and the centre of rotation. the lumbar fsu could resist a combination of bending moment and shear force of 156 nm and 620 n respectively, before complete disruption occurred. the tension force acting on the posterior structures was 2.8 kn. the flexion angulation just before failure was 20 degrees and the anterior horizontal displacement between the upper and lower vertebrae was 9 mm. the centre of rotation was located in the posterior part of the lower vertebral body. the bone mineral content in the vertebrae appeared to be a good predictor of ultimate strength of the lumbar fsu. knowledge of the biomechanical response of the lumbar spine under different static traumatic loads is a first step to better understand the injury mechanisms of the spine in traffic accidents.
a rust affecting myrtaceae was recently detected in new south wales, australia. based on urediniospore morphology and host range, it was identified as uredo rangelii, a taxon regarded as a member of the eucalyptus/guava rust (puccinia psidii sensu lato) complex, although confusion currently surrounds its taxonomy. the exotic rust was given the common name of myrtle rust to distinguish it from eucalyptus/guava rust. the more recent discovery of teliospores in nsw that match those of p. psidii sensu stricto indicates the rust in australia is a strain (with tonsured urediniospores) of p. psidii s.l. outside australia, p. psidii has a wide host range within myrtaceae, being reported from 129 species in 33 genera, and is very damaging in south and central america–including in eucalypt plantations in brazil–the caribbean and in florida and hawaii. to ascertain the potential threat to forestry in australia posed by the introduced rust, we tested key forestry species, as well as key known hosts of eucalyptus/guava rust, in artificial inoculation experiments. we showed that several species of eucalyptus are susceptible (viz. e. pilularis, e. cloeziana, e. agglomerata and e. grandis), as is melaleuca quinquenervia. observations during testing revealed a lengthened latent period (from inoculation until pustule formation and eruption) of four to five weeks during winter. here we also report on observations on new hosts from surveys in nsw under the emergency response that followed the detection of the exotic rust, and surveys in nsw and queensland following the cessation of the emergency response. in australia, p. psidii s.l. has currently been found on 107 host species in 30 genera during surveys, including species in angophora, asteromyrtus, austromyrtus, backhousia, callistemon, chamelaucium, choricarpia, decaspermum, eucalyptus, eugenia, gossia, lenwebbia, leptospermum, lophomyrtus, melaleuca, metrosideros, myrtus, pilidiostigma, rhodamnia, rhodomyrtus, ristantia, stockwellia, syncarpia, syzygium, tristania, tristaniopsis, ugni, uromyrtus and xanthostemon. species under cultivation (in nurseries and gardens) that are severely affected include gossiainophloia, agonis flexuosa, syzygium jambos and s. anisatum while species that are severely damaged in native bushland include rhodamnia rubescens, rhodomyrtus psidioides, choricarpia leptopetala and melaleuca quinquenervia. uredo rangelii (myrtle rust) is reported for the first time in australia — detected on 22 april 2010 — from agonis flexuosa, callistemon viminalis and syncarpia glomulifera. this taxon is morphologically distinct from puccinia psidii, the cause of guava rust, but dna sequence data place it in the p. psidii complex. surveys up to the end of may 2010 have detected u. rangelii on cultivated shrubs and trees at four properties (two cut flower farms and two wholesale nurseries) on the central coast of new south wales, with no records in native forest thus far. containment operations are currently underway on infected properties.
change in 6-minute walk distance (6mwd) has been used as a clinical marker in pulmonary hypertension. determinants and worsening of 6mwd remain a matter of debate because nonpulmonary factors have an impact on the 6mwd. we hypothesized that future reduction of 6mwd in patients with systemic sclerosis (ssc) was more closely associated with cardiac dysfunction. we prospectively performed standard clinical and echocardiographic evaluations in ssc patients with the 6-minute walk test at enrollment. features associated with the 6mwd were sought in a multiple linear regression analysis and compared using standardized β. worsening of the 6mwd was defined as a 15% reduction and served as the primary outcome. eighty-one patients were included. in the multivariate analysis, baseline 6mwd was related to ssc severity score (β = -0.250, p = 0.024), left atrial volume index (β = -0.222, p = 0.046), right ventricular fractional area change (β = 0.252, p = 0.025), and the ratio of mean pulmonary artery pressure and cardiac output (β = -0.31, p = 0.002). during follow-up, 20 patients reached the primary outcome. in sequential cox models, a model based on right ventricular fractional area change at baseline (chi-square 4.8) was improved by left atrial volume index (chi-square 10.3, p = 0.007). in conclusion, determinants and worsening of 6mwd are explained by cardiac factors. when using the 6mwd as a clinical marker in pulmonary hypertension patients, their left ventricular diastolic function and right ventricular systolic function should be taken into consideration. the subcommittee members initially agreed on the concepts of disease activity, damage and severity, defining severity as the total effect of disease on organ function. it was decided to start with the assessment of severity using the medsger's severity scale. a revised version of this scale was constructed. the rationale for the exclusion of other variables was provided.
beta-catenin (ctnnb1) is a dual function molecule that acts as a key component of the cadherin complex and wnt signaling pathway. it has a crucial role in embryogenesis, tumorigenesis, angiogenesis and progression of metastasis. recently, it has been suggested that the ctnnb1 complex is a major regulator of development of the mouse oviduct and uterus. however, little is known about the ctnnb1 gene in chickens. therefore, in this study, we focused on the ctnnb1 gene in the chicken reproductive tract and hormonal control of its expression in the chicken oviduct. ctnnb1 was localized specifically to the luminal and glandular epithelium of the four segments of chicken oviduct and des (diethylstilbestrol, a synthetic non-steroidal estrogen) increased its expression primarily in le of the magnum. in addition, ctnnb1 mrna and protein were expressed abundantly in glandular epithelium of endometrioid-type ovarian carcinoma, but not in normal ovaries. moreover, ctnnb1 expression was post-transcriptionally regulated via its 3'-utr by binding with target mirnas including mir-217, mir-1467, mir-1623 and mir-1697. collectively, these results indicate that ctnnb1 is a novel gene regulated by estrogen in epithelial cells of the chicken oviduct and that it is also abundantly expressed in epithelial cells of endometrioid-type ovarian carcinoma suggesting that it could be used as a marker for diagnosis of ovarian cancer in laying hens and women. introductionbreast cancer is a heterogeneous disease encompassing a number of phenotypically diverse tumours. expression levels of the oestrogen, progesterone and her2/neu receptors which characterize clinically distinct breast tumours have been shown to change during disease progression and in response to systemic therapies. mi(cro)rnas play critical roles in diverse biological processes and are aberrantly expressed in several human neoplasms including breast cancer, where they function as regulators of tumour behaviour and progression. the aims of this study were to identify mirna signatures that accurately predict the oestrogen receptor (er), progesterone receptor (pr) and her2/neu receptor status of breast cancer patients to provide insight into the regulation of breast cancer phenotypes and progression.methodsexpression profiling of 453 mirnas was performed in 29 early-stage breast cancer specimens. mirna signatures associated with er, pr and her2/neu status were generated using artificial neural networks (ann), and expression of specific mirnas was validated using rq-pcr.resultsstepwise ann analysis identified predictive mirna signatures corresponding with oestrogen (mir-342, mir-299, mir-217, mir-190, mir-135b, mir-218), progesterone (mir-520g, mir-377, mir-527-518a, mir-520f-520c) and her2/neu (mir-520d, mir-181c, mir-302c, mir-376b, mir-30e) receptor status. mir-342 and mir-520g expression was further analysed in 95 breast tumours. mir-342 expression was highest in er and her2/neu-positive luminal b tumours and lowest in triple-negative tumours. mir-520g expression was elevated in er and pr-negative tumours.conclusionsthis study demonstrates that ann analysis reliably identifies biologically relevant mirnas associated with specific breast cancer phenotypes. the association of specific mirnas with er, pr and her2/neu status indicates a role for these mirnas in disease classification of breast cancer. decreased expression of mir-342 in the therapeutically challenging triple-negative breast tumours, increased mir-342 expression in the luminal b tumours, and downregulated mir-520g in er and pr-positive tumours indicates that not only is dysregulated mirna expression a marker for poorer prognosis breast cancer, but that it could also present an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.
backgrounda multivariate genome-wide association test is proposed for analyzing data on multivariate quantitative phenotypes collected from related subjects. the proposed method is a two-step approach. the first step models the association between the genotype and marginal phenotype using a linear mixed model. the second step uses the correlation between residuals of the linear mixed model to estimate the null distribution of the fisher combination test statistic.resultsthe simulation results show that the proposed method controls the type i error rate and is more powerful than the marginal tests across different population structures (admixed or non-admixed) and relatedness (related or independent). the statistical analysis on the database of the study of addiction: genetics and environment (sage) demonstrates that applying the multivariate association test may facilitate identification of the pleiotropic genes contributing to the risk for alcohol dependence commonly expressed by four correlated phenotypes.conclusionsthis study proposes a multivariate method for identifying pleiotropic genes while adjusting for cryptic relatedness and population structure between subjects. the two-step approach is not only powerful but also computationally efficient even when the number of subjects and the number of phenotypes are both very large. for most human complex diseases and traits, snps identified by genome-wide association studies (gwas) explain only a small fraction of the heritability. here we report a user-friendly software tool called genome-wide complex trait analysis (gcta), which was developed based on a method we recently developed to address the "missing heritability" problem. gcta estimates the variance explained by all the snps on a chromosome or on the whole genome for a complex trait rather than testing the association of any particular snp to the trait. we introduce gcta's five main functions: data management, estimation of the genetic relationships from snps, mixed linear model analysis of variance explained by the snps, estimation of the linkage disequilibrium structure, and gwas simulation. we focus on the function of estimating the variance explained by all the snps on the x chromosome and testing the hypotheses of dosage compensation. the gcta software is a versatile tool to estimate and partition complex trait variation with large gwas data sets.
we modeled the firing rate of populations of olfactory receptor neurons (orns) responding to an odorant at different concentrations. two cases were considered: a population of orns that all express the same olfactory receptor (or), and a population that expresses many different ors. to take into account orn variability, we replaced single parameter values in a biophysical orn model with values drawn from statistical distributions, chosen to correspond to experimental data. for orns expressing the same or, we found that the distributions of firing frequencies are gaussian at all concentrations, with larger mean and standard deviation at higher concentrations. for a population expressing different ors, the distribution of firing frequencies can be described as the superposition of a gaussian distribution and a lognormal distribution. distributions of maximum value and dynamic range of spiking frequencies in the simulated orn population were similar to experimental results. olfactory receptors code the concentration of stimulating molecules into an impulse frequency message. patch-clamp recordings have now demonstrated, in the olfactory receptor cell membrane, a number of membrane conductances. some of them are gated by odorants, in the cilia, and depolarize the cell through camp- or ip3-sensitive channels, depending on the species. other conductances are activated by membrane depolarization and/or an increased intracellular ca2+ concentration; they participate in oscillating membrane potential changes during impulses and post-spike after-polarizations, and control the repetitive firing. original data relative to the resting potential and the impulse frequency coding of the odorant concentration are presented.
rationalerecent evidence suggests that imidazoline i2 receptor ligands are suitable for combination therapy with opioids. quantitative analysis of i2 receptor ligands combined with non-opioid drugs is necessary for the justification of alternative pain therapies.objectivethis study systematically examined the antihyperalgesic and response rate-suppressing effects of selective i2 receptor ligands (2-bfi and phenyzoline) alone and in combination with acetaminophen.methodsvon frey and hargreaves tests were used to examine the antihyperalgesic effects of drugs in complete freund’s adjuvant (cfa)-induced inflammatory pain in rats. food-reinforced schedule-controlled responding was used to assess the rate-suppressing effects of study drugs. dose-addition and isobolographic analyses were used to assess drug-drug interactions for all assays.results2-bfi (3.2–17.8 mg/kg, i.p.), phenyzoline (17.8–100 mg/kg, i.p.), and acetaminophen (56–178 mg/kg, i.p.) all dose-dependently produced significant antinociceptive effects. when studied as combinations, 2-bfi and acetaminophen produced infra-additive to additive interactions while phenyzoline and acetaminophen produced additive to supra-additive interactions. the same drug combinations suppressed response rate in a supra-additive manner.conclusionsquantitative analysis of the antihyperalgesic and response rate-suppressing effects suggests that i2 receptor ligands are not well suited to combination therapy with acetaminophen. &na; a method to measure cutaneous hyperalgesia to thermal stimulation in unrestrained animals is described. the testing paradigm uses an automated detection of the behavioral end‐point; repeated testing does not contribute to the development of the observed hyperalgesia. carrageenan‐induced inflammation resulted in significantly shorter paw withdrawal latencies as compared to saline‐treated paws and these latency changes corresponded to a decreased thermal nociceptive threshold. both the thermal method and the randall‐selitto mechanical method detected dose‐related hyperalgesia and its blockade by either morphine or indomethacin. however, the thermal method showed greater bioassay sensitivity and allowed for the measurement of other behavioral parameters in addition to the nociceptive threshold.
background wound infections are common, serious, surgical complications. oxidative killing by neutrophils is the primary defense against surgical pathogens and increasing intraoperative tissue oxygen tension markedly reduces the risk of such infections. since hypercapnia improves cardiac output and peripheral tissue perfusion, we tested the hypothesis that peripheral tissue oxygenation increases as a function of arterial carbon dioxide tension (paco2) in anesthetized humans. methods general anesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained with sevoflurane in 30% oxygen in 10 healthy volunteers. subcutaneous tissue oxygen tension (psqo2) was recorded from a subcutaneous tonometer. an oximeter probe on the upper arm measured muscle oxygen saturation. cardiac output was monitored noninvasively. paco2 was adjusted to 20, 30, 40, 50, or 60 mmhg in random order with each concentration being maintained for 45 min. results increasing paco2 linearly increased cardiac index and psqo2: psqo2 = 35.42 + 0.77 (paco2), p < 0.001. conclusions the observed difference in psqo2 is clinically important because previous work suggests that comparable increases in tissue oxygenation reduced the risk of surgical infection from −8% to 2 to 3%. we conclude that mild intraoperative hypercapnia increased peripheral tissue oxygenation in healthy human subjects, which may improve resistance to surgical wound infections. the partial rebreathing method of cardiac output estimation is reviewed with a particular focus on its application for continuous monitoring, rebreathing and implementations and from both a historical and technical perspective. the assumptions of the method are discussed as well as the various implementations. the nico monitor and rebreathing valve are described from a functional view. the clinical data including (a) comparisons between bolus thermodilution and continuous thermodilution in patients in the or setting, (b) comparisons to continuous thermodilution with both the baxter and abbott continuous cardiac output devices and (c) comparison between different means of shunt correction are presented. compared to conventional cardiac output methods, the partial co2 rebreathing technique is non-invasive, can easily be automated and can provide real-time and continuous cardiac output monitoring. taking advantage of modern sophisticated sensor and signal processing technology and integrating multiple monitored physiological variables the nico monitor is the first commercially available cardiac output system making use of the partial rebreathing of co2.
we introduce a novel optimization-based motion planner, the stochastic extended linear quadratic regulator (selqr), which computes a trajectory and associated linear control policy with the objective of minimizing the expected value of a user-defined cost function. selqr applies to robotic systems that have stochastic nonlinear dynamics with motion uncertainty modeled by gaussian distributions that can be state- and control-dependent. in each iteration, selqr uses a combination of forward and backward value iteration to estimate the cost-to-come and the cost-to-go for each state along a trajectory. selqr then locally optimizes each state along the trajectory at each iteration to minimize the expected total cost, which results in smoothed states that are used for dynamics linearization and cost function quadratization. selqr progressively improves the approximation of the expected total cost, resulting in higher quality plans. for applications with imperfect sensing, we extend selqr to plan in the robot's belief space. we show that our iterative approach achieves fast and reliable convergence to high-quality plans in multiple simulated scenarios involving a car-like robot, a quadrotor, and a medical steerable needle performing a liver biopsy procedure. we present extended lqr, a novel approach for locally-optimal control for robots with non-linear dynamics and non-quadratic cost functions. our formulation is conceptually different from existing approaches, and is based on the novel concept of lqr-smoothing, which is an lqr-analogue of kalman smoothing. our approach iteratively performs both a backward extended lqr pass, which computes approximate cost-to-go functions, and a forward extended lqr pass, which computes approximate cost-to-come functions. the states at which the sum of these functions is minimal provide an approximately optimal sequence of states for the control problem, and we use these points to linearize the dynamics and quadratize the cost functions in the subsequent iteration. our results indicate that extended lqr converges quickly and reliably to a locally-optimal solution of the non-linear, non-quadratic optimal control problem. in addition, we show that our approach is easily extended to include temporal optimization, in which the duration of a trajectory is optimized as part of the control problem. we demonstrate the potential of our approach on two illustrative non-linear control problems involving simulated and physical differential-drive robots and simulated quadrotor helicopters.
this work presents the hfsp scheduler, which implements a size-based scheduling discipline for hadoop. while the benefits of size-based scheduling disciplines are well recognized in a variety of contexts (computer networks, operating systems, etc...), their practical implementation for a system such as hadoop raises a number of important challenges. in hfsp we address issues related to job size estimation, resource management and study the effects of a variety of preemption strategies. although the architecture underlying hfsp is suitable for any size-based scheduling discipline, in this work we revisit and extend the fair sojourn protocol, which solves many problems related to job starvation that affect fifo, processor sharing and a range of size-based disciplines. our experiments, in which we compare hfsp to standard hadoop schedulers, pinpoint at a significant decrease in average job sojourn times – a metric that accounts for the total time a job spends in the system, including waiting and serving times – for realistic workloads that we generate according to production workload traces available in the literature. as organizations start to use data-intensive cluster computing systems like hadoop and dryad for more applications, there is a growing need to share clusters between users. however, there is a conflict between fairness in scheduling and data locality (placing tasks on nodes that contain their input data). we illustrate this problem through our experience designing a fair scheduler for a 600-node hadoop cluster at facebook. to address the conflict between locality and fairness, we propose a simple algorithm called delay scheduling: when the job that should be scheduled next according to fairness cannot launch a local task, it waits for a small amount of time, letting other jobs launch tasks instead. we find that delay scheduling achieves nearly optimal data locality in a variety of workloads and can increase throughput by up to 2x while preserving fairness. in addition, the simplicity of delay scheduling makes it applicable under a wide variety of scheduling policies beyond fair sharing.
backgroundthe objective of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the impact of the 2005 american thoracic society/infectious diseases society of america guideline-concordant antimicrobial therapy (gcat) on mortality following healthcare-associated pneumonia (hcap).methodswe searched medline, embase, biosis, cochrane central register of controlled trials, and scopus for clinical trials and observational studies comparing gcat to other treatment regimens in adults with hcap. the primary outcome chosen was 30-day mortality from any cause. secondary outcomes assessed length of hospital stay and time to clinical stability. random effects models were used to generate pooled odds ratios (ors) and weighed mean differences (wmds). heterogeneity was evaluated by the i2.resultsa total of six studies were included in the analysis and involved 15,850 participants. meta-analysis showed that gcat was associated with increased 30-day mortality compared to non-gcat (or 1.80, 95 % confidence interval [ci] 1.26–2.7). there was no advantage in gcat over non-gcat in terms of hospital length of stay (wmd 1.18 days, 95 % ci −0.48 to 2.84) or time to clinical stability (wmd 0.17 days, 95 % ci −0.32 to 0.67).conclusionin hospitalized patients with hcap, gcat did not show survival benefit compared to non-gcat. however, our results are limited by the cohort design of the selected studies and the degree of heterogeneity among them. future trials are needed to identify risk factors for multidrug-resistant pathogens in hcap patients who may benefit from broad-spectrum antimicrobial regimens. objective because of the pressure for timely, informed decisions in public health and clinical practice and the explosion of information in the scientific literature, research results must be synthesized. meta-analyses are increasingly used to address this problem, and they often evaluate observational studies. a workshop was held in atlanta, ga, in april 1997, to examine the reporting of meta-analyses of observational studies and to make recommendations to aid authors, reviewers, editors, and readers.   participants twenty-seven participants were selected by a steering committee, based on expertise in clinical practice, trials, statistics, epidemiology, social sciences, and biomedical editing. deliberations of the workshop were open to other interested scientists. funding for this activity was provided by the centers for disease control and prevention.   evidence we conducted a systematic review of the published literature on the conduct and reporting of meta-analyses in observational studies using medline, educational research information center (eric), psyclit, and the current index to statistics. we also examined reference lists of the 32 studies retrieved and contacted experts in the field. participants were assigned to small-group discussions on the subjects of bias, searching and abstracting, heterogeneity, study categorization, and statistical methods.   consensus process from the material presented at the workshop, the authors developed a checklist summarizing recommendations for reporting meta-analyses of observational studies. the checklist and supporting evidence were circulated to all conference attendees and additional experts. all suggestions for revisions were addressed.   conclusions the proposed checklist contains specifications for reporting of meta-analyses of observational studies in epidemiology, including background, search strategy, methods, results, discussion, and conclusion. use of the checklist should improve the usefulness of meta-analyses for authors, reviewers, editors, readers, and decision makers. an evaluation plan is suggested and research areas are explored.
background pectus excavatum (pex) is a depression of the sternum in relation to the costal cartilages. clinical and objective measures for classifying the defect are rare and difficult to apply. the present study aimed to create an anthropometric index (ai) for pex as a method for diagnosis and for preoperative and postoperative assessment by comparing it to the haller index (hi) and to the lower vertebral index (lvi).   methods from december 2001 to february 2004, 2 groups of patients were studied at our institution: a) 30 patients with normal configuration of the thoracic cage, upon physical examination; b) 20 patients with pex. the latter underwent surgery according to the ravitch technique modified by robicsek, and they were evaluated in the postoperative period. all patients were assessed by means of the ai (clinical), hi (tomographic), and lvi (radiographic) measures at the level of deepest deformity in the case of the pex patients, and in the distal third of the sternum in the normal patients. the patients who had undergone surgery were once again measured between the 60th and the 80th postoperative days.   results there was a high correlation between the ai and the hi (80% p < .001) and between the ai and the lvi (79% p < .001). the accuracy of the 3 indices was similar, in that the following cut points were established: ai = 0.12, hi = 3.10, and lvi = 0.25. upon analyzing the preoperative results, we verified that for the 3 indices, over 75% of the patients with pectus excavatum were above the cut points and were confirmed as having the defect. in the postoperative results, the value of the indices found below the cut point was considered within the normal standard, and this occurred in 100% for the ai, in over 50% for the hi, and in 50% for the lvi.   conclusions the ai allowed adequate measurement of the defect, maintaining a) a high correlation with the hi and the lvi and a high accuracy, similar to the already acknowledged and published indices and b) an efficient comparison between the preoperative measurement and the postoperative results. this paper contains an analysis of the long-term results in 85 patients who had pectus excavatum or carinatum deformities repaired at the north middlesex hospital between 1951 and 1977. seventy-seven patients had operations for correction of pectus excavatum and eight for pectus carinatum. a variety of surgical techniques was used. in the excavatum deformities the best results were obtained by the extensive resection of all deformed cartilages, the correction of the sternal deformity by a simple transverse wedge osteotomy, and by stabilising the chest with a stainless steel plate. for pectus carinatum, the involved cartilages were resected and an osteotomy of the sternum was performed. we preferred in most cases to stabilise the chest wall with a metal strut in this deformity as well. the best cosmetic results were achieved by the use of a stainless steel plate passed beneath the sternum and left for not more than six months.
our laboratory has suggested that central command provides selective inhibition of the cardiomotor component of aortic baroreflex at the start of exercise, preserving carotid sinus baroreflex. it is postulated that central command may modify the signal transduction of aortic baroreceptors, so as to decrease aortic baroreceptor input to the cardiovascular centers, and, thereby, can cause the selective inhibition of aortic baroreflex. to test the hypothesis, we directly analyzed the responses in multifiber aortic nerve activity (aona) and carotid sinus nerve activity (csna) during spontaneous motor activity in decerebrate, paralyzed cats. the increases of 62-104% in mean aona and csna were found during spontaneous motor activity, in proportion to a rise of 35 ± 3 mmhg (means ± se) in mean arterial blood pressure (map), and had an attenuating tendency by restraining heart rate (hr) at the lower intrinsic frequency of 154 ± 6 beats/min. brief occlusion of the abdominal aorta was conducted before and during spontaneous motor activity to produce a mechanically evoked increase in map and, thereby, to examine the stimulus-response relationship of arterial baroreceptors. although the sensitivity of the map-hr baroreflex curve was markedly blunted during spontaneous motor activity, the stimulus-response relationships of aona and csna were not influenced by spontaneous motor activity, irrespective of the absence or presence of the hr restraint. thus, it is concluded that aortic and carotid sinus baroreceptors can code beat-by-beat blood pressure during spontaneous motor activity in decerebrate cats and that central command is unlikely to modulate the signal transduction of arterial baroreceptors. animals decerebrated at the precollicular-premammillary body level exhibit spontaneous locomotion without any artificial stimulation. our laboratory reported that the cardiovascular and autonomic responses at the onset of spontaneous locomotor events are evoked by central command, generated from the caudal diencephalon and the brain stem (matsukawa k, murata j, and wada t. am j physiol heart circ physiol 275: h1115-h1121, 1998). in this study, we examined whether central command and/or a reflex resulting from muscle afferents modulates arterial baroreflex function using a decerebrate cat model. the baroreflex was evoked by stimulating the aortic depressor nerve (adn) at the onset of spontaneous muscle contraction (to test the possible influence of central command) and during electrically evoked contraction or passive stretch (to test the possible influence of the muscle reflex). when the adn was stimulated at rest, heart rate and arterial blood pressure decreased by 40 +/- 2 beats/min and 11 +/- 1 mmhg, respectively. the baroreflex bradycardia was attenuated to 55 +/- 4% at the onset of spontaneous contraction. the attenuating effect on the baroreflex bradycardia was not observed at the onset and middle of electrically evoked contraction or passive stretch. the depressor response to adn stimulation was identical among resting and any muscle interventions. the inhibition of the baroreflex bradycardia during spontaneous contraction was seen after beta-adrenergic blockade but abolished by muscarinic blockade, suggesting that the bradycardia is mainly evoked through cardiac vagal outflow. we conclude that central command, produced within the caudal diencephalon and the brain stem, selectively inhibits the cardiac component, but not the vasomotor component, of the aortic baroreflex at the onset of spontaneous exercise.
this paper addresses the integration of xml tags into a term-weighting function for focused xml information retrieval (ir). our model allows us to consider a certain kind of structural information: tags that represent a logical structure (e.g., title, section, paragraph, etc.) as well as other tags (e.g., bold, italic, center, etc.). we take into account the influence of a tag by estimating the probability for this tag to distinguish relevant terms from the others. then, these weights are integrated in a term-weighting function. experiments on a large collection from the inex 2008 xml ir evaluation campaign showed improvements on focused xml retrieval. wikipedia is a well known free content, multilingual encyclopedia written collaboratively by contributors around the world. anybody can edit an article using a wiki markup language that offers a simplified alternative to html. this encyclopedia is composed of millions of articles in different languages.
purposea repeat pap smear is sometimes necessary after a short time interval or even immediately, when patients seek for a second opinion or due to study participation. only limited information is available on the possible impact of a short interval between two pap smears. most institutions therefore practice a minimum time span of 6–8 weeks before obtaining a second smear since a short interval is commonly believed to be associated with an increase of false negative results in the second smear.methodstwo consecutive pap smears were obtained from 81 women. 41 smears were processed using the conventional technique, whereas liquid-based cytology was used in the remaining 40 women. smears were independently evaluated by four different cytopathologists. we analyzed the effect of time interval, both processing techniques and inter-observer variance in cytological evaluation.resultswhile the result of the second smear shows a tendency towards a more benign outcome (odds ratio (or) 1.436, 95% ci 0.972–2.121), this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.07). no significant differences were observed between conservative and liquid-based cytology (or 1.554, 95% ci 0.659–3.667, p = 0.31). there was considerable inter-observer variability, and the observer was a strong predictor of the cytological result (or 0.632–5.083, 95% ci 0.355–8.975, p < 0.01).conclusionswe document a tendency towards a more benign outcome without statistical significance in the second smear. inter-observer variability of different cytopathologists is high and should be kept in mind when evaluating cytology results. meta-analysis involves combining summary information from related but independent studies. the objectives of a meta-analysis include increasing power to detect an overall treatment effect, estimation of the degree of benefit associated with a particular study treatment, assessment of the amount of variability between studies, or identification of study characteristics associated with particularly effective treatments. this article presents a tutorial on meta-analysis intended for anyone with a mathematical statistics background. search strategies and review methods of the literature are discussed. emphasis is focused on analytic methods for estimation of the parameters of interest. three modes of inference are discussed: maximum likelihood; restricted maximum likelihood, and bayesian. finally, software for performing inference using restricted maximum likelihood and fully bayesian methods are demonstrated. methods are illustrated using two examples: an evaluation of mortality from prophylactic use of lidocaine after a heart attack, and a comparison of length of hospital stay for stroke patients under two different management protocols.
healthcare data are naturally sparse, high dimensional, and require frequent schema change during storage. to overcome the above challenges, both simple and multi-data-type entity-attribute-value (eav) data storage models are often used in place of the traditional horizontal data model. however, representing data in either of the formats generally result into queries that are both inefficient and rather complex. in this paper we present an enhanced data model for representing this class of data which dramatically improves the efficiency and reduces the complexity of the queries thereof. this is achieved by finding a compromise between the conventional horizontal data model and the eav data models. to attest the validity of the new crossbreed model, enhanced entity-attribute-value (eeav), its performance is evaluated against that of conventional horizontal data model, simple eav data model and multi-data-type eav data model with regard to querying of data sets of varying sizes. abstract objective to determine the effects of a policy of “use acupuncture” on headache, health status, days off sick, and use of resources in patients with chronic headache compared with a policy of “avoid acupuncture.” design randomised, controlled trial. setting general practices in england and wales. participants 401 patients with chronic headache, predominantly migraine. interventions patients were randomly allocated to receive up to 12 acupuncture treatments over three months or to a control intervention offering usual care. main outcome measures headache score, sf-36 health status, and use of medication were assessed at baseline, three, and 12 months. use of resources was assessed every three months. results headache score at 12 months, the primary end point, was lower in the acupuncture group (16.2, sd 13.7, n = 161, 34% reduction from baseline) than in controls (22.3, sd 17.0, n = 140, 16% reduction from baseline). the adjusted difference between means is 4.6 (95% confidence interval 2.2 to 7.0; p = 0.0002). this result is robust to sensitivity analysis incorporating imputation for missing data. patients in the acupuncture group experienced the equivalent of 22 fewer days of headache per year (8 to 38). sf-36 data favoured acupuncture, although differences reached significance only for physical role functioning, energy, and change in health. compared with controls, patients randomised to acupuncture used 15% less medication (p = 0.02), made 25% fewer visits to general practitioners (p = 0.10), and took 15% fewer days off sick (p = 0.2). conclusions acupuncture leads to persisting, clinically relevant benefits for primary care patients with chronic headache, particularly migraine. expansion of nhs acupuncture services should be considered.
the present study explored the possible preventive effects of blue light emitting diodes (leds) on cadmium (cd)-induced oxidative stress and immunotoxicity in zebrafish. to this end, zebrafish were exposed to a white fluorescent bulb or blue leds (ldb, peak at 450nm, at an irradiance of 0.9w/m2), and 0 or 30µgl-1 waterborne cd for 5 weeks. growth performance, survival rate, and hepatic histology, ultrastructure, antioxidant and innate immune responses were determined in zebrafish. cd exposure alone reduced growth and survival rate, and induced oxidative damage and changes in histology and ultrastructure. however, cd exposure in combination with ldb apparently relieved these negative effects. the alleviation of adverse effects might result from the up-regulation of antioxidant and innate immune genes at transcriptional, translational, or post-translational levels. cd exposure alone dramatically enhanced mrna levels of nuclear transcription factor κb (nf-κb) and e2-related factor (nrf2). however, compared to cd exposure alone, cd exposure in combination with ldb apparently down-regulated both genes. taken together, our results suggest that chronic cd exposure induced a negative effect on zebrafish, possibly involved in nf-κb-induced immunotoxicity and nrf2-induced oxidative stress. finally, for the first time, our data demonstrated that ldb could protect fish against cd toxicity. cadmium (cd) is an environmental contaminant that poses serious risks to aquatic organisms and their associated ecosystem. the mechanisms underlying cd-induced oxidative stress and immunotoxicity in fish remain largely unknown. in this study, adult female zebrafish were exposed to 0 (control), 1mgl-1 cd for 24h and 96h, and the oxidative stress and inflammatory responses induced by cd were evaluated in the brain, liver and ovary. reactive oxygen species (ros), nitric oxide (no), and malondialdehyde (mda) increased in a time-dependent manner after treatment with cd in the brain and liver. the increase may result from the disturbance of genes including copper and zinc superoxide dismutase (cu/zn-sod), catalase (cat), inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos), and ciclooxigenase-2 (cox-2) at mrna, protein and activity levels. although ros, no and mda were not significantly affected by cd in the ovary, the up-regulation of cu/zn-sod, cat, inos, and cox-2 was observed. exposure to cd induced a sharp increase in the protein levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-α) in the brain, liver and ovary, possibly contributing to activate inflammatory responses. furthermore, we also found a dramatic increase in mrna levels of nf-e2-related factor 2 (nrf2) and nuclear transcription factor κb (nf-κb) at 24h in the liver and ovary. the corresponding changes in the mrna levels of kelch-like-ech-associated protein 1 (keap1a and keap1b) and the inhibitor of κbα (iκbαa and iκbαb) may contribute to regulate the transcriptional activity of nrf2 and nf-κb, respectively. contrarily, mrna levels of nrf2, nf-κb, keap1, keap1b, iκbαa and iκbαb remained stable at 24 and 96h in the brain. taken together, we demonstrated cd-induced oxidative stress and immunotoxicity in fish, possibly through transcriptional regulation of nrf2 and nf-κb and gene modifications at transcriptional, translational, post-translational levels, which would greatly extend our understanding on the cd toxicity.
previous work from this laboratory has shown that expression of human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) immediate-early (ie) genes from the major immediate-early promoter (miep) is likely to be regulated by chromatin remodelling around the promoter affecting the acetylation state of core histone tails. the hcmv miep contains sequences that bind cellular transcription factors responsible for its negative regulation in undifferentiated, non-permissive cells. ets-2 repressor factor (erf) is one such factor that binds to such sequences and represses ie gene expression. although it is not known how cellular transcription factors such as erf mediate transcriptional repression of the miep, it is likely to involve differentiation-specific co-factors. in this study, the mechanism by which erf represses hcmv ie gene expression was analysed. erf physically interacts with the histone deacetylase, hdac1, both in vitro and in vivo and this physical interaction between erf and hdac1 mediates repression of the miep. this suggests that silencing of viral ie gene expression, associated with histone deacetylation events around the miep, is mediated by differentiation-dependent cellular factors such as erf, which specifically recruit chromatin remodellers to the miep in non-permissive cells. the 86k immediate early (ie) 2 protein of human cytomegalovirus trans-activates a number of homologous and heterologous promoters, including the cellular promoter for the 70k heat-shock protein (hsp70), and the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat. we have previously shown that ie2 trans-activates these two promoters in a tata-dependent manner, and that ie2 is able to form a direct contact with tata-box binding protein (tbp) in vitro. we now show that ie2 binds to the basic repeat region of tbp. in addition ie2 can contact a second general transcription factor, tfiib. we have mapped the tbp- and tfiib-binding regions within ie2 and show that these regions overlap, and also lie within parts of the protein previously identified as being required for the trans-activation and autoregulation functions of ie2.
life-long regular endurance exercise is known to counteract the deterioration of cardiovascular and metabolic function and overall mortality. yet it remains unknown if life-long regular endurance exercise can influence the connective tissue accumulation of advanced glycation endproducts (ages) that is associated with aging and lifestyle-related diseases. we therefore examined two groups of healthy elderly men: 15 master athletes (64 ± 4 years) who had been engaged in life-long endurance running and 12 old untrained (66 ± 4 years) together with two groups of healthy young men; ten young athletes matched for running distance (26 ± 4 years), and 12 young untrained (24 ± 3 years). age cross-links (pentosidine) of the patellar tendon were measured biochemically, and in the skin, it was assessed by a fluorometric method. in addition, we determined mechanical properties and microstructure of the patellar tendon. life-long regular endurance runners (master athletes) had a 21 % lower age cross-link density compared to old untrained. furthermore, both master athletes and young athletes displayed a thicker patellar tendon. these cross-sectional data suggest that life-long regular endurance running can partly counteract the aging process in connective tissue by reducing age-related accumulation of ages. this may not only benefit skin and tendon but also other long-lived protein tissues in the body. furthermore, it appears that endurance running yields tendon tissue hypertrophy that may serve to lower the stress on the tendon and thereby reduce the risk of injury. the present study examined the hypothesis that collagen fibril diameter and crimp angle in ruptured human achilles tendons differed from that of intact ones. tissue samples were obtained from the central core (distal core) and the posterior periphery (distal superficial) at the rupture site, and the proximally intact (proximal superficial) part of the tendon in 10 subjects (38+/-8 years) with a complete tendon rupture. for comparisons corresponding tissue samples were procured from age (38+/-7 years) and gender matched intact achilles tendons during routine forensic autopsy. the cross-sectional area density and diameter distribution of fibrils were analyzed using stereological techniques of digitized electron microscopy biopsy cross-sections, while crimp angle was measured by the changing banding pattern of collagen fibers when rotated between crossed polars. nine of 10 persons with tendon ruptures reported that the injury did not occur during exceedingly large forces, and none experienced any symptoms in the days or months prior to the injury. fibril diameter distribution showed no region-specific differences in either the ruptured or intact tendons for either group. however, in the distal core there were fewer fibrils in the ruptured compared to the intact tendons in 60-150 nm range, p<0.01. similarly, in the distal superficial portion there were fewer fibrils in the ruptured compared to the intact tendons in the 90-120 nm range, 2p<0.05, while there were no differences in the proximal superficial tendons. crimp angle did not display any region-specific differences, or any difference between the rupture and intact tendons. in conclusion, these data suggest that although crimp morphology is unchanged there appears to be a site-specific loss of larger fibrils in the core and periphery of the achilles tendon rupture site. moreover, the lack of symptoms prior to the rupture suggests that clinical tendinopathy is not an etiological factor in complete tendon ruptures.
database clusters based on share-nothing replication techniques are currently widely accepted as a practical solution to scalability and availability of the data tier. a key issue when planning such systems is the ability to meet service level agreements when load spikes occur or cluster nodes fail. this translates into the ability to provision and deploy additional nodes. many current research efforts focus on designing autonomic controllers to perform such reconfiguration, tuned to quickly react to system changes and spawn new replicas based on resource usage and performance measurements. in contrast, we are concerned about the inherent impact of deploying an additional node to an online cluster, considering both the time required to finish such an action as well as the impact on resource usage and performance of the cluster as a whole. if noticeable, such impact hinders the practicability of self-management techniques, since it adds an additional dimension that has to be accounted for. our approach is to systematically benchmark a number of different reconfiguration scenarios to assess the cost of bringing a new replica online. we consider factors such as: workload characteristics, incremental and parallel recovery, flow control and outdatedness of the recovering replica. as a result, we show that research should be refocused from optimizing the capture and transmition of changes to applying them, which in a realistic setting dominates the cost of the recovery operation. many cluster based replication solutions have been proposed providing scalability and fault-tolerance. many of these solutions perform replica control in a middleware on top of the database replicas. in such a setting concurrency control is a challenge and is often performed on a table basis. additionally, some systems put severe requirements on transaction programs (e.g., to declare all objects to be accessed in advance). this paper addresses these issues and presents a middleware-based replication scheme which provides the popular snapshot isolation level at the same tuple-level granularity as database systems like postgresql and oracle, without any need to declare transaction properties in advance. both read-only and update transactions can be executed at any replica while providing data consistency at all times. our approach provides what we call "1-copy-snapshot-isolation" as long as the underlying database replicas provide snapshot isolation. we have implemented our approach as a replicated middleware on top of postgresql replicas. by providing a standard jdbc interface, the middleware is completely transparent to the client program. fault-tolerance is provided by automatically reconnecting clients in case of crashes. our middleware shows good performance in terms of response times and scalability.
dizziness is a common and often disabling disorder. in some people the cause of their dizziness is pathology or dysfunction of upper cervical vertebral segments that can be treated with manual therapy. the aim of the present study was to systematically review the literature on the manual therapy treatment of patients with cervicogenic dizziness, by identifying and evaluating both randomized controlled trials (rcts) and non-rcts (controlled clinical trials and non-controlled studies). seven electronic databases were searched up to july 2003, article reference lists were screened and an expert panel elicited to obtain relevant trials. nine studies met the inclusion criteria and key data was extracted. two reviewers assessed the validity of the studies using the cochrane format and found that all studies had low methodological quality. however, a consistent finding was that all studies had a positive result with significant improvement in symptoms and signs of dizziness after manual therapy treatment. therefore, level 3 evidence for manual therapy treatment of cervicogenic dizziness was obtained indicating it should be considered in the management of patients with this disorder provided there is evidence of improvement. this review has identified the need for further rcts of acceptable methodological quality. background although low back pain is usually a self-limiting and benign disease that tends to improve spontaneously over time, a large variety of therapeutic interventions are available for the treatment of low back pain.   objectives the objective of this review was to assess the effects of acupuncture for the treatment of non-specific low back pain.   search strategy we searched the cochrane complementary medicine field trials register, the cochrane controlled trials register (1997, issue 1), medline (1966 - 1996), embase (1988 - 1996), science citation index and reference lists of articles.   selection criteria randomised trials of all types of acupuncture treatment that involves needling for subjects with non-specific low back pain.   data collection and analysis two reviewers blinded with respect to authors, institution and journal independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.   main results eleven trials were included. the methodological quality was low. only two trials were of high quality. three trials compared acupuncture to no treatment, which were of low methodological quality and provide conflicting evidence. there was moderate evidence from two trials that acupuncture is not more effective than trigger point injection or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (tens). there was limited evidence from eight trials that acupuncture is not more effective than placebo or sham acupuncture for the treatment of chronic low back pain.   reviewer's conclusions the evidence summarised in this systematic review does not indicate that acupuncture is effective for the treatment of back pain.
summaryit has been suggested that some patients undergoing prolonged treatment for osteoporosis with anti-resorptive agents may benefit from discontinuing treatment. here we use a computer simulation of bone cell activity to estimate changes in bone mineral density (bmd) and tissue age when treatment is discontinued.introductionalthough anti-resorptive agents are effective at reducing fracture risk, questions remain regarding how long patients should continue treatment and how long treatment should be discontinued. suspending treatment as part of a drug holiday may reduce the risk of adverse effects, but may also lead to reduced bmd.methodswe use a computer simulation of the bone remodeling process to estimate how bmd and mean tissue age are changed after treatment is suspended. mean tissue age is studied because increased tissue age has been associated with impaired bone quality and has been linked to the risk of adverse effects.resultsour simulations suggest that bmd gains from anti-resorptive therapy can be lost over time, especially with anti-resorptive agents that have little residual effects. with regard to mean tissue age, the simulations suggest that increases in tissue age from anti-resorptive treatment are long lasting; increases in mean tissue age caused by treatment may remain for as long as 15 years after treatment is suspended. after stopping treatment, reductions in bmd are expected to occur long before mean tissue age returns to normal.conclusionsour simulations suggest that, when using a long-lasting anti-resorptive agent, 1- to 5-year drug holidays may have little effect on bmd in most patients but that drug holiday intervals that maintain bmd are unlikely to reverse alterations in tissue age caused by treatment. our analysis echoes recent reviews suggesting patient selection and monitoring when anti-resorptive treatment is discontinued. context the optimal duration of treatment of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis is uncertain.   objective to compare the effects of discontinuing alendronate treatment after 5 years vs continuing for 10 years.   design and setting randomized, double-blind trial conducted at 10 us clinical centers that participated in the fracture intervention trial (fit).   participants one thousand ninety-nine postmenopausal women who had been randomized to alendronate in fit, with a mean of 5 years of prior alendronate treatment.   intervention randomization to alendronate, 5 mg/d (n = 329) or 10 mg/d (n = 333), or placebo (n = 437) for 5 years (1998-2003).   main outcome measures the primary outcome measure was total hip bone mineral density (bmd); secondary measures were bmd at other sites and biochemical markers of bone remodeling. an exploratory outcome measure was fracture incidence.   results compared with continuing alendronate, switching to placebo for 5 years resulted in declines in bmd at the total hip (-2.4%; 95% confidence interval [ci], -2.9% to -1.8%; p<.001) and spine (-3.7%; 95% ci, -4.5% to -3.0%; p<.001), but mean levels remained at or above pretreatment levels 10 years earlier. similarly, those discontinuing alendronate had increased serum markers of bone turnover compared with continuing alendronate: 55.6% (p<.001) for c-telopeptide of type 1 collagen, 59.5% (p < .001) for serum n = propeptide of type 1 collagen, and 28.1% (p<.001) for bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, but after 5 years without therapy, bone marker levels remained somewhat below pretreatment levels 10 years earlier. after 5 years, the cumulative risk of nonvertebral fractures (rr, 1.00; 95% ci, 0.76-1.32) was not significantly different between those continuing (19%) and discontinuing (18.9%) alendronate. among those who continued, there was a significantly lower risk of clinically recognized vertebral fractures (5.3% for placebo and 2.4% for alendronate; rr, 0.45; 95% ci, 0.24-0.85) but no significant reduction in morphometric vertebral fractures (11.3% for placebo and 9.8% for alendronate; rr, 0.86; 95% ci, 0.60-1.22). a small sample of 18 transilial bone biopsies did not show any qualitative abnormalities, with bone turnover (double labeling) seen in all specimens.   conclusions women who discontinued alendronate after 5 years showed a moderate decline in bmd and a gradual rise in biochemical markers but no higher fracture risk other than for clinical vertebral fractures compared with those who continued alendronate. these results suggest that for many women, discontinuation of alendronate for up to 5 years does not appear to significantly increase fracture risk. however, women at very high risk of clinical vertebral fractures may benefit by continuing beyond 5 years.   trial registration clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct 00398931.
the paper proposes a novel view based consistency model for distributed shared memory. a view is a set of ordinary, data objects that a processor has the right to access in a data-race-free program. the view based consistency model only requires that the data objects of a view are updated before a processor accesses them. compared with other memory consistency models, the view based consistency model can achieve data selection without user annotation and can reduce much false-sharing effect. this model has been implemented based on treadmarks. performance results have shown that for all our applications, the view based consistency model outperforms the lazy release consistency model. shared memory facilitates the transition from sequential to parallel processing. since most data structures can be retained, simply adding synchronization achieves correct, efficient programs for many applications. we discuss our experience with parallel computing on networks of workstations using the treadmarks distributed shared memory system. dsm allows processes to assume a globally shared virtual memory even though they execute on nodes that do not physically share memory. we illustrate a dsm system consisting of n networked workstations, each with its own memory. the dsm software provides the abstraction of a globally shared memory, in which each processor can access any data item without the programmer having to worry about where the data is or how to obtain its value.
cholesterol-oximes tro19622 and tro40303 target outer mitochondrial membrane proteins and have beneficial effects in preclinical models of neurodegenerative diseases leading to their advancement to clinical trials. dopaminergic neurons degenerate in parkinson's disease (pd) and are prone to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. in order to provide insights into the neuroprotective potential of tro19622 and tro40303 for dopaminergic neurons in vivo, we assessed their effects on gene expression in laser captured nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons of wildtype mice and of mice that over-express alpha-synuclein, a protein involved in both familial and sporadic forms of pd (thy1-asyn mice). young mice were fed the drugs in food pellets or a control diet from 1 to 4months of age, approximately 10months before the appearance of striatal dopamine loss in this model. unbiased weighted gene co-expression network analysis (wgcna) of transcriptional changes revealed effects of cholesterol oximes on transcripts related to mitochondria, cytoprotection and anti-oxidant response in wild-type and transgenic mice, including increased transcription of stress defense (e.g. prdx1, prdx2, glrx2, hspa9, pink1, drp1, trak1) and dopamine-related (th, ddc, gch1, dat, vmat2, drd2, chnr6a) genes. even at this young age transgenic mice showed alterations in transcripts implicated in mitochondrial function and oxidative stress (e.g. bcl-2, bax, casp3, nos2), and both drugs normalized about 20% of these alterations. young thy1-asyn mice exhibit motor deficits that differ from parkinsonism and are established before the onset of treatment; these deficits were not improved by cholesterol oximes. however, high doses of tro40303 improved olfaction and produced the same effects as dopamine agonists on a challenging beam test, specifically an increase in footslips, an observation congruent with its effects on transcripts involved in dopamine synthesis. high doses of tro19622 increased alpha-synuclein aggregates in the substantia nigra; this effect, not seen with tro40303 was inconsistent and may represent a protective mechanism as in other neurodegenerative diseases. overall, the results suggest that cholesterol oximes, while not improving early effects of alpha-synuclein overexpression on motor behavior or pathology, may ameliorate the function and resilience of dopaminergic neurons in vivo and support further studies of neuroprotection in models with dopaminergic cell loss. microarray-based assays have significantly expanded their scope and range of applications over the last 10 years, and--at least for gene expression--can be considered mainstream applications. high-throughput, microarray-based gene expression studies have proven particularly useful in the study of neurodegenerative diseases, for which they have provided key insights in understanding disease pathogenesis, regional and cellular specificity, and identification of therapeutic targets. even though many experimental steps are currently performed in specialized core facilities, the key steps of a microarray study--experimental design, and data analysis and interpretation--are performed by the primary investigator. knowledge of the issues related to these key steps is essential to properly perform and interpret a microarray experiment and constitutes the main focus of the present chapter. the basic analytical steps are covered, and annotated r code for the analysis of a published dataset is provided.
rationalecytochrome p450 enzymes are important in the metabolism of antidepressants. the highly polymorphic nature of these enzymes has been linked to variability in antidepressant metabolism rates, leading to hope regarding the use of p450 genotyping to guide treatment. however, evidence that p450 genotypic differences underlie the variation in treatment outcomes is inconclusive.objectiveswe explored the links between both p450 genotype and serum concentrations of antidepressant with antidepressant side effects, using data from the genome-based therapeutic drugs for depression project (gendep), which is a large (n = 868), pharmacogenetic study of depressed individuals treated with escitalopram or nortriptyline.methodspatients were genotyped for the enzymes cyp2c19 and cyp2d6, and serum concentrations of both antidepressant and primary metabolite were measured after 8 weeks of treatment. side effects were assessed weekly. we investigated associations between p450 genotypes, serum concentrations of antidepressants and side effects, as well as the relationship between p450 genotype and study discontinuation.resultsp450 genotype did not predict total side effect burden (nortriptyline: n = 251, p = 0.5638, β = −0.133, standard error (se) = 0.229; escitalopram: n = 340, p = 0.9627, β = −0.004, se = 0.085), study discontinuation (nortriptyline n = 284, hazard ratio (hr) = 1.300, p = 0.174; escitalopram n = 376, hr = 0.870, p = 0.118) or specific side effects. serum concentrations of antidepressant were only related to a minority of the specific side effects measured: dry mouth, dizziness and diarrhoea.conclusionsin this sample where antidepressant dosage is titrated using clinical judgement, p450 genotypes do not explain differences between patients in side effects with antidepressants. serum drug concentrations appear to only explain variability in the occurrence of a minority of specific side effects. the construction of a depression rating scale designed to be particularly sensitive to treatment effects is described. ratings of 54 english and 52 swedish patients on a 65 item comprehensive psychopathology scale were used to identify the 17 most commonly occurring symptoms in primary depressive illness in the combined sample. ratings on these 17 items for 64 patients participating in studies of four different antidepressant drugs were used to create a depression scale consisting of the 10 items which showed the largest changes with treatment and the highest correlation to overall change. the inner-rater reliability of the new depression scale was high. scores on the scale correlated significantly with scores on a standard rating scale for depression, the hamilton rating scale (hrs), indicating its validity as a general severity estimate. its capacity to differentiate between responders and non-responders to antidepressant treatment was better than the hrs, indicating greater sensitivity to change. the practical and ethical implications in terms of smaller sample sizes in clinical trials are discussed.
to investigate the independent and interactive effects of opiate addiction and hiv on neuroinflammation, we measured microglial/macrophage activation and astrogliosis in multiple regions of human brain. samples of thalamus, frontal gray matter, and frontal white matter were obtained from 46 individuals categorized as: hiv negatives, hiv-negative opiate addicts, hiv positives, hiv-positive opiate addicts, hiv encephalitis (hive), and hive opiate addicts. activated brain microglia/macrophages and astrocytosis were quantified by morphometric analysis of immunohistochemical stains for cd68, hla-d, cd163, and gfap. the effects of hiv grouping, opiate addiction, and their interaction on expression of the markers were examined in a series of two-way anovas. in opiate addicts, there was generally higher baseline expression of cd68 and hla-d in hiv negatives, and lower expression in hiv and hive, compared to individuals without opiate abuse. thus, for these markers, and for gfap in frontal gray, opiates were associated with attenuated hiv effect. in contrast, for cd163, opiates did not significantly alter responses to hiv, and hiv effects were variably absent in individuals without opiate abuse. the divergent impact that opiate addiction displays on these markers may suggest a generally immunosuppressive role in the cns, with decreased hiv-associated activation of markers cd68 and hla-d that potentially reflect neurotoxic pathways, and preservation of cd163, thought to be an indicator of neuroprotective scavenger systems. these results suggest a complex impact of opiates on neuroinflammation in baseline and virally stimulated states. the national neuroaids tissue consortium (nntc) was founded in 1998, in response to the scientific need for well‐characterized central nervous system (cns) and peripheral nervous system (pns) tissues and fluids from hiv‐infected individuals. in addition to performing the routine functions of non‐transplant anatomic tissue banks, the consortium offers a unique model for the integration of independent research entities in order to provide well‐characterized tissues and fluids for the international research community. herein, we describe the structure of the consortium, pointing out the inherent strengths of linking together multiple independent sites for the purpose of banking hiv‐infected nervous system tissues. we describe the neuropathology protocol that was adopted and successfully implemented at the four participating banks of the consortium.
inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) mrna is up-regulated in vivo by dibutyryl-camp (db-camp), the purine-2y receptor agonist 2-methylthio-atp and escherichia coli endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (lps). ethanol and diethyldithiocarbamate inhibit lps-stimulated inos mrna. their effects on db-camp- and 2-methylthio-atp-stimulated inos mrna remain undefined. we examined the effect of ethanol (4.5 g/kg intraperitoneal) and intratracheal diethyldithiocarbamate (5 mg/kg) on intratracheal lps (0.6 mg/kg), db-camp (0.1 and 1 mg/kg) or 2-methylthio-atp (5 mg/kg)-stimulated rat alveolar macrophage (am) inos mrna and protein, reactive nitrogen intermediates nitrite and nitrate anion (rni) and nuclear transcription factor-kappab (nf-kappab) in vivo. lps and the autacoids increased inos mrna and protein in rat am and rni in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and in ex vivo incubates of am compared with these parameters in control rats (n = 6-21/group). only lps up-regulated tnf-alpha mrna and release of tnf-alpha in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and am. ethanol inhibited lps stimulation of the inos cascade at the level of transcription but inhibited only autacoid-stimulated inos protein and rni. diethyldithiocarbamate selectively inhibited the lps-stimulated inos cascade at the level of transcription. coadministration of ethanol and diethyldithiocarbamate inhibited lps-stimulated inos mrna, protein and rni more than either inhibitor alone but did not differ from ethanol alone on autacoid-stimulated inos protein or rni. lps increased and db-camp did not affect nf-kappab in am. ethanol inhibited lps-stimulated nf-kappab. thus, two distinct pathways exist for induction of inos mrna in rat am in vivo: an nf-kappab pathway for lps and cytokines inhibitable by ethanol and diethyldithiocarbamate and an nf-kappab-independent pathway, refractory to inhibition by ethanol and diethyldithiocarbamate for db-camp and 2-mes-atp. finally, ethanol inhibits inos at the level of transcription and at the level of the enzyme. research over the past 5 years has demonstrated that immunologic activation of mouse macrophages induces the activity of nitric oxide synthase, which oxidizes a guanidino nitrogen of l-arginine, yielding citrulline and the reactive radical, nitric oxide. a review of the biochemistry and immunologic regulation of this pathway in macrophages provides a backdrop against which to evaluate its effector functions. reports published in the past 2 years suggest that synthesis of no mediates much of the antimicrobial activity of mouse macrophages against some fungal, helminthic, protozoal and bacterial pathogens.
to obtain a systems-level perspective on the topological and functional relationships among proteins contributing to nucleotide excision repair (ner) in saccharomyces cerevisiae, we built two models to analyze protein–protein physical interactions. a recursive computational model based on set theory systematically computed overlaps among protein interaction neighborhoods. a statistical model scored computation results to detect significant overlaps which exposed protein modules and hubs concurrently. we used these protein entities to guide the construction of a multi-resolution landscape which showed relationships among ner, transcription, dna replication, chromatin remodeling, and cell cycle regulation. literature curation was used to support the biological significance of identified modules and hubs. the ner landscape revealed a hierarchical topology and a recurrent pattern of kernel modules coupling a variety of proteins in structures that provide diverse functions. our analysis offers a computational framework that can be applied to construct landscapes for other biological processes. the blast programs are widely used tools for searching protein and dna databases for sequence similarities. for protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the blast programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. a new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped blast program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. in addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by blast into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. the resulting position-specific iterated blast (psi-blast) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped blast, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. psi-blast is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the brct superfamily.
high-dose intravenous immunoglobulins alter the disease activity of adult-onset still's disease (aosd). because activation status of fcgammar is possibly dependent on their genetic polymorphisms, we investigated whether the polymorphisms of fcgammar iia and iiia are risk factors, and affect the clinical features of aosd. genomic dna was extracted from 36 patients and from 197 healthy controls. polymerase chain reaction for fcgammar iia and iiia using the allele-specific primers and direct sequencing of fcgammar iiia polymorphic site were performed. the frequencies of fcgammar iia/iiia genotype between patients with aosd and controls were not different. the allelic frequencies of fcgammar iia/iiia between patients with aosd and controls were not different, either. however, the fcgammar iia-r/r131 genotype was associated with a higher concentration of hemoglobin (p=0.04) and stable liver function (p=0.009) than the other genotypes. the fcgammar iiia-f/f176 genotype was associated with significantly lower titers of serum ferritin (p=0.025), and higher serum albumin (p=0.037) and cholesterol (p=0.014) concentrations than the other genotypes. this study suggest that the fcgammar iia and iiia polymorphisms might not be genetic risk factors for aosd in korean, but contribute to the activity of disease. fcgammar iia-r/r131 and iiia-f/f176 genotypes, low-binding genotypes for igg2a and g1, may have more protective effects in acute stage of the disease than the other genotypes. stimulation of primary human monocytes from several donors by cross‐linking of fcγ receptor type i (fcγri) and fcγrii gave rise to calcium mobilization and protein tyrosine phosphorylation. these early events were not observed without cross‐linking. cd45, a transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase, when co‐cross‐linked with either fcγri or fcγrii, could prevent fcγri and fcγrii‐mediated calcium mobilization and protein tyrosine phosphorylation. when interleukin (il)‐6 production was measured, we noted a strong il‐6 production after activation of primary human monocytes by cross‐linking of fcγri or fcγrii. in contrast to calcium mobilization and tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins, il‐6 production was not affected by co‐cross‐linking of cd45 with either fcγri or fcγrii. interestingly, cross‐linking of the cd45 itself was sufficient to induce il‐6 production. our results show that the cd45 molecule is important in modulating early events following stimulation of primary human monocytes by cross‐linking of fcγri or fcγrii. however, triggering of cd45 alone can also induce il‐6 production, indicating that cd45 ligation itself can give signals and may have an important role in cytokine induction pathways.
obtaining models that capture imaging markers relevant for disease progression and treatment monitoring is challenging. models are typically based on large amounts of data with annotated examples of known markers aiming at automating detection. high annotation effort and the limitation to a vocabulary of known markers limit the power of such approaches. here, we perform unsupervised learning to identify anomalies in imaging data as candidates for markers. we propose anogan, a deep convolutional generative adversarial network to learn a manifold of normal anatomical variability, accompanying a novel anomaly scoring scheme based on the mapping from image space to a latent space. applied to new data, the model labels anomalies, and scores image patches indicating their fit into the learned distribution. results on optical coherence tomography images of the retina demonstrate that the approach correctly identifies anomalous images, such as images containing retinal fluid or hyperreflective foci. in recent years, supervised learning with convolutional networks (cnns) has seen huge adoption in computer vision applications. comparatively, unsupervised learning with cnns has received less attention. in this work we hope to help bridge the gap between the success of cnns for supervised learning and unsupervised learning. we introduce a class of cnns called deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (dcgans), that have certain architectural constraints, and demonstrate that they are a strong candidate for unsupervised learning. training on various image datasets, we show convincing evidence that our deep convolutional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations from object parts to scenes in both the generator and discriminator. additionally, we use the learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating their applicability as general image representations.
broad amplitude variability and skewed distributions are characteristic features of quantal synaptic currents (minis) at central synapses. the relative contributions of the various underlying sources are still debated. through computational models of thalamocortical neurons, we separated intra- from extra-synaptic sources. our simulations indicate that the external factors of local input resistance and dendritic filtering generate equally small amounts of negatively skewed synaptic variability. the ability of these two factors to reduce positive skew increased as their contribution to variability increased, which in control trials for morphological, biophysical, and experimental parameters never exceeded 10% of the range. with these dendritic factors ruled out, we tested multiple release models, which led to distributions with clearly non-physiological multiple peaks. we conclude that intra-synaptic organization is the primary determinant of synaptic variability in thalamocortical neurons and, due to extra-synaptic mechanisms, is more potent than the data suggested. thalamortical neurons, especially in rodents, constitute a remarkably favorable system for molecular genetic studies of synaptic variability and its functional consequence. techniques of in vitro whole-cell recording and compartmental modeling were combined to investigate dendritic structure and calcium currents in individual thalamocortical neurons. voltage-clamp recordings of i t obtained in intact and dissociated ventrobasal neurons were used to constrain i t conductances and passive parameters incorporated in morphorealistic models. high dendritic i t densities were found necessary to establish congruent model behavior. several methodologies based on axial resistance conservation were developed to algorithmically reduce thalamocortical morphology into a behaviorally congruent low-order compartmental model. this type of simplified model is suitable for investigating the functional role played by distal t- current localization at the network level in sleep oscillations and epilepsy.
it is widely expected that the quality of offspring will vary with the age of their parents and that this variation should influence animals’ choice of mates. however, theoretical predictions for age effects are contradictory and, to our knowledge, we do not know for any wild animal how the quality of offspring is affected by both parents’ ages across their lifespans, or whether mothers’ and fathers’ ages interact. we tackled this question using long-term data on a highly philopatric, insular population of the blue-footed booby (sula nebouxii). in this species extra-pair paternity is most common in pairs of two young parents or two old parents, implying that these age combinations might prejudice offspring quality. analysis of the viability of 3,361 offspring of parents up to 21 years old revealed that fledglings with two young parents or two old parents were least likely to become breeders, whereas fledglings with one young parent and one old parent were most likely to do so. for young parents of either sex, offspring viability increased with age of the other parent; for very old parents, it decreased. these effects could be mediated by parents flexibly modifying their investment in offspring in response to their own and their partners´ ages, but evidence for this was lacking. in 5,343 breeding attempts, although mothers’ and fathers’ ages independently affected four heavily care-dependent breeding traits at the clutch and nestling stages, their interaction did not affect any trait. the effects of parental age combinations on viability could also be mediated by genes: fledglings with one young parent and one old parent could benefit from greater heterozygosity or better genes. summary this paper describes and discusses graphical techniques, based on the primitive empirical cumulative distribution function and on quantile (q-q) plots, percent (p-p) plots and hybrids of these, which are useful in assessing a one-dimensional sample, either from original data or resulting from analysis. areas of application include: the comparison of samples; the comparison of distributions; the presentation of results on sensitivities of statistical methods; the analysis of collections of contrasts and of collections of sample variances; the assessment of multivariate contrasts;_ and the structuring of analysis of variance mean squares. many of the objectives and techniques are illustrated by examples. this paper reviews a variety of old and new statistical techniques based on the cumulative distribution function and its ramifications. included in the coverage are applications, for various situations and purposes, of quantile probability plots (q-q plots), percentage probability plots (p-p plots) and extensions and hybrids of these. the general viewpoint is that of analysis of data by statistical methods that are suggestive and constructive rather than formal procedures to be applied in the light of a tightly specified mathematical model. the technological background is taken to be current capacities in data collection and highspeed computing systems, including graphical display facilities. it is very often useful in statistical data analysis to examine and to present a body of data as though it may have originated as a one-dimensional sample, i.e. data which one wishes to treat for purposes of analysis, as an unstructured array. sometimes this is applicable to ' original' data; even more often such a viewpoint is useful with 'derived' data, e.g. residuals from a model fitted to the data. the empirical cumulative distribution function and probability plotting methods have a key role in the statistical treatment of one-dimensional samples, being of relevance for summarization and palatable description as well as for exposure and inference.
information status plays an important role in discourse processing. according to the hearer’s common sense knowledge and his comprehension of the preceding text, a discourse entity could be old, mediated or new. in this paper, we propose an attention-based lstm model to address the problem of fine-grained information status classification in an incremental manner. our approach resembles how human beings process the task, i.e., decide the information status of the current discourse entity based on its preceding context. experimental results on the isnotes corpus (markert et al., 2012) reveal that (1) despite its moderate result, our model with only word embedding features captures the necessary semantic knowledge needed for the task by a large extent; and (2) when incorporating with additional several simple features, our model achieves the competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art approach (hou et al., 2013) which heavily depends on lots of hand-crafted semantic features. recognizing bridging anaphora is difficult due to the wide variation within the phenomenon, the resulting lack of easily identifiable surface markers and their relative rarity. we develop linguistically motivated discourse structure, lexico-semantic and genericity detection features and integrate these into a cascaded minority preference algorithm that models bridging recognition as a subtask of learning finegrained information status (is). we substantially improve bridging recognition without impairing performance on other is classes.
recent studies show that motor responses similar to those present in one's own pain (freezing effect) occur as a result of observation of pain in others. this finding has been interpreted as the physiological basis of empathy. alternatively, it can represent the physiological counterpart of an embodiment phenomenon related to the sense of body ownership. we compared the empathy and the ownership hypotheses by manipulating the perspective of the observed hand model receiving pain so that it could be a first-person perspective, the one in which embodiment occurs, or a third-person perspective, the one in which we usually perceive the others. motor-evoked potentials (meps) by tms over m1 were recorded from first dorsal interosseous muscle, whereas participants observed video clips showing (a) a needle penetrating or (b) a q-tip touching a hand model, presented either in first-person or in third-person perspective. we found that a pain-specific inhibition of mep amplitude (a significantly greater mep reduction in the “pain” compared with the “touch” conditions) only pertains to the first-person perspective, and it is related to the strength of the self-reported embodiment. we interpreted this corticospinal modulation according to an “affective” conception of body ownership, suggesting that the body i feel as my own is the body i care more about. when we look at our hands, we immediately know that they are part of our own body. this feeling of ownership of our limbs is a fundamental aspect of self-consciousness. we have studied the neuronal counterparts of this experience. a perceptual illusion was used to manipulate feelings of ownership of a rubber hand presented in front of healthy subjects while brain activity was measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. the neural activity in the premotor cortex reflected the feeling of ownership of the hand. this suggests that multisensory integration in the premotor cortex provides a mechanism for bodily self-attribution.
objective: antibodies to eye muscle tissue are demonstrated in hyperthyroid graves’ disease but their pathognomonic roles have not been clarified yet. we suggest that type 2 deiodinase (dio2) enzyme can be a target between orbital and thyroid diseases in hyperthyroid graves’ ophthalmopathy. in this study, the relationship between anti-eye muscle membrane (eyem) and cytosol (eyec) igg, iga and igm antibodies and eye muscle dio2 activity was investigated in hyperthyroid graves’ disease. methods: thirty-two patients with hyperthyroid graves’ disease (20 had ophthalmopathy), mean age 36 ± 13 years, 27 females and 5 males formed the patient group. thyroid hormone levels were measured with chemiluminescence immunoassay, antithyroid antibody and anti-eye muscle antibody levels with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, but tsh receptor antibodies with radioimmunoassay. eye muscle dio2 activity was measured using 125i-t4. results: eyem and eyec igg antibodies were associated with increased eye muscle dio2 activity compared to those who were negative for these antibodies (2.79 ± 2.53 vs 17.88 ± 20.06 pmol/mg/min, p<0.015 for eyem-igg and 6.88 ± 9.62 vs 26.76 ± 23.86 pmol/mg/min, p<0.008 for eyec-igg). the difference in eyec-igm antibodies was significant between patients with and without ophthalmopathy (10.1 ± 4.73 vs 3.46 ± 3.18 pmol/mg/min, p<0.023). the presence of eyem-igm antibodies was associated with lower eye muscle dio2 activities with significantly decreased eye muscle thicknesses (8.51 ± 15.38 vs 2.6 ± 0.1 pmol/mg/min and 4.71 ± 1.23 vs 3.9 ± 0.14 mm, p<0.04). conclusion: anti-eye muscle antibodies were associated with increased or decreased eye muscle dio2 activities affecting eye muscle thicknesses in hyperthyroid graves’ ophthalmopathy. dio2 enzyme can be a new target between orbital and thyroid diseases in hyperthyroid graves’ ophthalmopathy. circulating igg and iga anti-thyroid and anti-eye muscle antibodies were investigated in 87 patients with graves' disease (60 cases with ophthalmopathy). the elisa method was used. both igg and iga antibodies were demonstrated against human thyroid and eye-muscle membrane or cytosol antigens. anti-eye-muscle antibodies of the iga type were observed more frequently than those of the igg type (25 cases vs. 18 were demonstrated with membrane antigens and 37 cases vs. 23 with cytosol antigens). the respective distributions for thyroid antigens the cytosol fraction were 55 cases vs. 13 and 18 cases vs. 36. a significant difference was observed in the anti-thyroid igg levels and the anti-eye-muscle membrane or cytosol levels between the patients with graves' disease and those in control group (p less than 0.001). the difference in the iga antibody to thyroid and eye-muscle antigens was significant between the patients with and without ophthalmopathy (p less than 0.002). the strong correlation between the levels of iga antibodies to thyroid and those to the eye-muscle cytosol fractions might be connected with the theory of the common aetiology of the thyroid and eye diseases in graves' ophthalmopathy (p less than 0.001). circulating iga anti-human thyroid and eye-muscle antibodies seemed to have a diagnostic relevance in the development of ophthalmopathy in graves' ophthalmopathy.
in search of a primer set that could be used to study planctomycetes dynamics in lakes and especially via fingerprinting methods, e.g. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), three existing specific primer sets, developed for marine and soil systems, have been tested on water samples from four freshwater ecosystems. the first primer set (pla46f/pla886r) allowed pcr amplification of planctomycetes sequences in only one of the four ecosystems, whereas the second primer set (pla40f/p518r) amplified planctomycetes sequences in all the studied ecosystems but with a low specificity, since sequences belonging to verrucomicrobiales and chlamydiales clades were also amplified. finally, the third primer set (pla352f/pla920r) allowed amplification of planctomycetes sequences in the four ecosystems with a very high specificity. it amplified all known planctomycetes genera and yielded the highest operational taxonomic unit (otu) richness and diversity estimates. in silico analyses supported these results. further experiments comparing pla352f/pla920r to pla46f/p1390r (a primer set generating a longer pcr fragment, also used to study planctomycetes) yielded very similar results. our findings suggest that the primer set pla352f/pla920r provides good estimates of planctomycetes richness and diversity compared with other, and can thus be used to study planctomycetes dynamics in lentic freshwater ecosystems. the ribosomal database project-ii (rdp-ii) pro-vides data, tools and services related to ribosomal rna sequences to the research community. through its website (http://rdp.cme.msu.edu), rdp-ii offers aligned and annotated rrna sequence data, analysis services, and phylogenetic inferences (trees) derived from these data. rdp-ii release 8.1 contains 16 277 prokaryotic, 5201 eukaryotic, and 1503 mitochondrial small subunit rrna sequences in aligned and annotated format. the current public beta release of 9.0 debuts a new regularly updated alignment of over 50 000 annotated (eu)bacterial sequences. new analysis services include a sequence search and selection tool (hierarchy browser) and a phylogenetic tree building and visualization tool (phylip interface). a new interactive tutorial guides users through the basics of rrna sequence analysis. other services include probe checking, phylogenetic placement of user sequences, screening of users' sequences for chimeric rrna sequences, automated alignment, production of similarity matrices, and services to plan and analyze terminal restriction fragment polymorphism (t-rflp) experiments. the rdp-ii email address for questions or comments is rdpstaff@msu.edu.
quantifying the dynamics of intrahost hiv-1 sequence evolution is one means of uncovering information about the interaction between hiv-1 and the host immune system. in the chronic phase of infection, common dynamics of sequence divergence and diversity have been reported. we developed an hiv-1 sequence evolution model that simulated the effects of mutation and fitness of sequence variants. the amount of evolution was described by the distance from the founder strain, and fitness was described by the number of offspring a parent sequence produces. analysis of the model suggested that the previously observed saturation of divergence and decrease of diversity in later stages of infection can be explained by a decrease in the proportion of offspring that are mutants as the distance from the founder strain increases rather than due to an increase of viral fitness. the prediction of the model was examined by performing phylogenetic analysis to estimate the change in the rate of evolution during infection. in agreement with our modeling, in 13 out of 15 patients (followed for 3–12 years) we found that the rate of intrahost hiv-1 evolution was not constant but rather slowed down at a rate correlated with the rate of cd4+ t-cell decline. the correlation between the dynamics of the evolutionary rate and the rate of cd4+ t-cell decline, coupled with our hiv-1 sequence evolution model, explains previously conflicting observations of the relationships between the rate of hiv-1 quasispecies evolution and disease progression. abstract to understand the high variability of the asymptomatic interval between primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) infection and the development of aids, we studied the evolution of the c2-v5 region of the hiv-1 env gene and of t-cell subsets in nine men with a moderate or slow rate of disease progression. they were monitored from the time of seroconversion for a period of 6 to 12 years until the development of advanced disease in seven men. based on the analysis of viral divergence from the founder strain, viral population diversity within sequential time points, and the outgrowth of viruses capable of utilizing the cxcr4 receptor (x4 viruses), the existence of three distinct phases within the asymptomatic interval is suggested: an early phase of variable duration during which linear increases (∼1% per year) in both divergence and diversity were observed; an intermediate phase lasting an average of 1.8 years, characterized by a continued increase in divergence but with stabilization or decline in diversity; and a late phase characterized by a slowdown or stabilization of divergence and continued stability or decline in diversity. x4 variants emerged around the time of the early- to intermediate-phase transition and then achieved peak representation and began a decline around the transition between the intermediate and late phases. the late-phase transition was also associated with failure of t-cell homeostasis (defined by a downward inflection in cd3+ t cells) and decline of cd4+ t cells to ≤200 cells/μl. the strength of these temporal associations between viral divergence and diversity, viral coreceptor specificity, and t-cell homeostasis and subset composition supports the concept that the phases described represent a consistent pattern of viral evolution during the course of hiv-1 infection in moderate progressors. recognition of this pattern may help explain previous conflicting data on the relationship between viral evolution and disease progression and may provide a useful framework for evaluating immune damage and recovery in untreated and treated hiv-1 infections.
backgroundthe genetic cascades underpinning vertebrate early eye morphogenesis are poorly understood. one gene family essential for eye morphogenesis encodes the retinal homeobox (rx) transcription factors. mutations in the human retinal homeobox gene (rax) can lead to gross morphological phenotypes ranging from microphthalmia to anophthalmia. zebrafish rx3 null mutants produce a similar striking eyeless phenotype with an associated expanded forebrain. thus, we used zebrafish rx3-/- mutants as a model to uncover an rx3-regulated gene network during early eye morphogenesis.resultsrx3-regulated genes were identified using whole transcriptomic sequencing (rna-seq) of rx3-/- mutants and morphologically wild-type siblings during optic vesicle morphogenesis. a gene co-expression network was then constructed for the rx3-regulated genes, identifying gene cross-talk during early eye development. genes highly connected in the network are hub genes, which tend to exhibit higher expression changes between rx3-/- mutants and normal phenotype siblings. hub genes down-regulated in rx3-/- mutants encompass homeodomain transcription factors and mediators of retinoid-signaling, both associated with eye development and known human eye disorders. in contrast, genes up-regulated in rx3-/- mutants are centered on wnt signaling pathways, associated with brain development and disorders. the temporal expression pattern of rx3-regulated genes was further profiled during early development from maternal stage until visual function is fully mature. rx3-regulated genes exhibited synchronized expression patterns, and a transition of gene expression during the early segmentation stage when rx3 was highly expressed. furthermore, most of these deregulated genes are enriched with multiple rax-binding motif sequences on the gene promoter.conclusionshere, we assembled a comprehensive model of rx3-regulated genes during early eye morphogenesis. rx3 promotes optic vesicle morphogenesis and represses brain development through a highly correlated and modulated network, exhibiting repression of genes mediating wnt signaling and concomitant enhanced expression of homeodomain transcription factors and retinoid-signaling genes. summary: high-throughput rna sequencing (rna-seq) is rapidly emerging as a major quantitative transcriptome profiling platform. here, we present degseq, an r package to identify differentially expressed genes or isoforms for rna-seq data from different samples. in this package, we integrated three existing methods, and introduced two novel methods based on ma-plot to detect and visualize gene expression difference. availability: the r package and a quick-start vignette is available at http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/software/degseq contact: xwwang@tsinghua.edu.cn; zhangxg@tsinghua.edu.cn supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.
the genomes of armillaria fuscipes, ceratocystiopsis minuta, ceratocystis adiposa, endoconidiophora laricicola, e. polonica, and penicillium freii daomc 242723 are presented in this genome announcement. these six genomes are from plant pathogens and otherwise economically important fungal species. the genome sizes range from 21 mb in the case of ceratocystiopsis minuta to 58 mb for the basidiomycete armillaria fuscipes. these genomes include the first reports of genomes for the genus endoconidiophora. the availability of these genome data will provide opportunities to resolve longstanding questions regarding the taxonomy of species in these genera. in addition these genome sequences through comparative studies with closely related organisms will increase our understanding of how these pathogens cause disease. motivation: although many next-generation sequencing (ngs) read preprocessing tools already existed, we could not find any tool or combination of tools that met our requirements in terms of flexibility, correct handling of paired-end data and high performance. we have developed trimmomatic as a more flexible and efficient preprocessing tool, which could correctly handle paired-end data. results: the value of ngs read preprocessing is demonstrated for both reference-based and reference-free tasks. trimmomatic is shown to produce output that is at least competitive with, and in many cases superior to, that produced by other tools, in all scenarios tested. availability and implementation: trimmomatic is licensed under gpl v3. it is cross-platform (java 1.5+ required) and available at http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=trimmomatic contact: usadel@bio1.rwth-aachen.de supplementary information: supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online.
we effortlessly perform reach movements to objects in different directions and depths. however, how networks of cortical neurons compute reach depth from binocular visual inputs remains largely unknown. to bridge the gap between behavior and neurophysiology, we trained a feed-forward artificial neural network to uncover potential mechanisms that might underlie the 3d transformation of reach depth. our physiologically-inspired 4-layer network receives distributed 3d visual inputs (1st layer) along with eye, head and vergence signals. the desired motor plan was coded in a population (3rd layer) that we read out (4th layer) using an optimal linear estimator. after training, our network was able to reproduce all known single-unit recording evidence on depth coding in the parietal cortex. network analyses predict the presence of eye/head and vergence changes of depth tuning, pointing towards a gain-modulation mechanism of depth transformation. in addition, reach depth was computed directly from eye-centered (relative) visual distances, without explicit absolute depth coding. we suggest that these effects should be observable in parietal and pre-motor areas. human saccades require a nonlinear, eye orientation-dependent reference frame transformation to transform visual codes to the motor commands for eye muscles. primate neurophysiology suggests that this transformation is performed between the superior colliculus and brain stem burst neurons, but provides little clues as to how this is done. to understand how the brain might accomplish this, we trained a 3-layer neural net to generate accurate commands for kinematically correct 3-d saccades. the inputs to the network were a 2-d, eye-centered, topographic map of gaussian visual receptive fields and an efference copy of eye position in 6-dimensional, push-pull "neural integrator" coordinates. the output was an eye orientation displacement command in similar coordinates appropriate to drive brain stem burst neurons. the network learned to generate accurate, kinematically correct saccades, including the eye orientation-dependent tilts in saccade motor error commands required to match saccade trajectories to their visual input. our analysis showed that the hidden units developed complex, eye-centered visual receptive fields, widely distributed fixed-vector motor commands, and "gain field"-like eye position sensitivities. the latter evoked subtle adjustments in the relative motor contributions of each hidden unit, thereby rotating the population motor vector into the correct correspondence with the visual target input for each eye orientation: a distributed population mechanism for the visuomotor reference frame transformation. these findings were robust; there was little variation across networks with between 9 and 49 hidden units. because essentially the same observations have been reported in the visuomotor transformations of the real oculomotor system, as well as other visuomotor systems (although interpreted elsewhere in terms of other models) we suggest that the mechanism for visuomotor reference frame transformations identified here is the same solution used in the real brain.
the microfibrillar protein fibrillin-1 is expressed abundantly in the vasculature and the glomerulus of the kidney. mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene lead to marfan syndrome. the most common complication of this disease is aortic dilatation due to elastic deficiencies of the vascular wall. several case reports describe glomerular disease in patients with marfan syndrome, and fibrillin-1 has been implicated in nephrogenesis. to study the role of fibrillin-1 in renal development and function, we characterized the renal phenotype of fibrillin-1-underexpressing mice. kidney histology was evaluated by means of morphometry and stereology. relative kidney weights, daily urine excretion, urinary albumin excretion, serum and urinary creatinine, as well as serum urea were not different than wild-type mice. glomerular number and renal capillarization were normal. the size of the renal filtration surface was comparable in wild-type and fibrillin-1-underexpressing mice. there was no indication for glomerular, renal vascular, or tubulointerstitial injury. however, glomerular volume and mesangial area were reduced. no changes in glomerular cell numbers were detected, but the cellular volume of mesangial cells was significantly lower in glomeruli of fibrillin-1-underexpressing mice. thus, despite the high abundance of fibrillin-1 in glomeruli of wild-type animals, underexpression of fibrillin-1 did not lead to functional deficiencies of the glomerulus. alterations in renal histology were only subtle with a reduced glomerular volume and mesangial area likely due to a reduced mesangial cell volume. in the past, there has been considerable concern that treatment with active vitamin d might accelerate progression independent of hypercalcemia and hypercalcuria. nevertheless, 1,25(oh)2d3 has known antiproliferative properties and has also been shown to inhibit renal growth. since glomerular growth is a permissive factor for the development of glomerulosclerosis, we reasoned that 1,25(oh)2d3 might even attenuate progression. to test this working hypothesis we performed two experiments of 8 and 16 weeks duration, respectively, to compare subtotally nephrectomized (snx) rats treated with ethanol and snx treated with 1,25(oh)2d3. control animals were sham operated and pair-fed with snx animals. 1,25(oh)2d3 (3 ng/100 g body wt/day) was administered by osmotic minipump. 1,25(oh)2d3 had no significant effect on systolic blood pressure and only a transient effect on weight gain. snx reduced the number of glomeruli (left kidney) from an average of 3.3 x 10(4) to 1.2 x 10(4) per kidney. mean glomerular volume was 3.87 +/- 0.71 x 10(6) microns 3 in sham operated animals and significantly (p < 0.05) higher (10.1 +/- 1.75 x 10(6) microns 3) in untreated animals 16 weeks after snx. glomerular volume was significantly (p < 0.05) less in 1,25(oh)2d3 treated snx [10.1 +/- 1.75 in ethanol vs. 7.04 +/- 1.78 in 1,25(oh)2d3 treated snx]. in parallel, there was significantly (p < 0.01) less glomerulosclerosis [glomerulosclerosis index 1.16 +/- 0.14 in the ethanol treated snx vs. 0.80 +/- 0.16 in snx treated with 1,25(oh)2d3] in the eight week experiment. albuminuria was significantly (p < 0.01) lower in 1,25(oh)2d3 treated than in ethanol treated snx (mean 0.785 mg/24 hr, range 0.43 to 1.80, vs. 3.75 mg/24 hr, 1.29 to 14.2). the morphological data were directionally analogous in a second 16 week experiment. only slight changes of the vascular sclerosis index and tubulointerstitial index were seen in snx and were not affected by 1,25(oh)2d3 further. to prove that the effect of 1,25(oh)2d3 was independent of pth, parathyreoidectomized snx rats without or with 1,25(oh)2d3 treatment were examined seven days post-snx. pcna staining showed suppression of cell proliferation. furthermore, in situ hybridization for transforming growth factor-b (tgf-beta) showed less vascular and tubular expression in 1,25(oh)2d3 treated rats. we conclude that 1,25(oh)2d3 has antiproliferative actions during the compensatory growth of nephrons in response to subtotal nephrectomy. these effects are independent of pth. the data document that 1,25(oh)2d3 reduces renal cell proliferation and glomerular growth as well as glomerulosclerosis and albuminuria as indicators of progressive glomerular damage.
backgroundclinical education is an important component of many health professional training programs. there is a range of questionnaires to assess the quality of the clinical educator however none are in student-led clinic environments. the present study developed a questionnaire to assess the quality of the clinical educators in the osteopathy program at victoria university.methodsa systematic search of the literature was used to identify questionnaires that evaluated the quality of clinical teaching. eighty-three items were extracted and reviewed for their appropriateness to include in a questionnaire by students, clinical educators and academics. a fifty-six item questionnaire was then trialled with osteopathy students. a variety of statistics were used to determine the number of factors to extract. exploratory factor analysis (efa) was used to investigate the factor structure.resultsthe number of factors to extract was calculated to be between 3 and 6. review of the factor structures suggested the most appropriate fit was four and five factors. the efa of the four-factor solution collapsed into three factors. the five-factor solution demonstrated the most stable structure. internal consistency of the five-factor solution was greater than 0.70.conclusionsthe five factors were labelled learning environment (factor 1), reflective practice (factor 2), feedback (factor 3) and patient management (factor 4) and modelling (factor 5). further research is now required to continue investigating the construct validity and reliability of the questionnaire. previous research evaluating the performance of horn's parallel analysis (pa) factor retention method with ordinal variables has produced unexpected findings. specifically, pa with pearson correlations has performed as well as or better than pa with the more theoretically appropriate polychoric correlations. seeking to clarify these findings, the current study employed a more comprehensive simulation study that included the systematic manipulation of 7 factors related to the data (sample size, factor loading, number of variables per factor, number of factors, factor correlation, number of response categories, and skewness) as well as 3 factors related to the pa method (type of correlation matrix, extraction method, and eigenvalue percentile). the results from the simulation study show that pa with either pearson or polychoric correlations is particularly sensitive to the sample size, factor loadings, number of variables per factor, and factor correlations. however, whereas pa with polychorics is relatively robust to the skewness of the ordinal variables, pa with pearson correlations frequently retains difficulty factors and is generally inaccurate with large levels of skewness. in light of these findings, we recommend the use of pa with polychoric correlations for the dimensionality assessment of ordinal-level data.
purpose. to evaluate induced changes in pupil and accommodative response for different accommodative stimuli with three different multifocal contact lenses (cls). methods. accommodative and pupil responses with three aspheric multifocal cls of simultaneous focus center near (purevision low add, purevision high add and focus progressives) for two accommodative stimuli of −2.5 and −4.00 d were recorded in 10 young subjects. accommodative response, peak velocity, and time constant of accommodation and pupil constriction were assessed. the measurements were evaluated in all the participants with distance-single vision cls and with the three multifocal cls. the monocular measurements were performed in a random sequence for each participant. all parameters were measured with a hartmann-shack aberrometer (irx-3; imagine eyes, orsay, france). results. differences were not found in accommodation response for both accommodative stimuli studied between the single vision lens and the three different multifocal cls (p > 0.05 for both stimuli). for the 2.5 d stimulus, significant differences were not found in peak velocity and time constant between the single vision lens and the three different multifocal cls (p > 0.05 for all situations); in amplitude of pupil constriction, differences were only found for the situation with purevision high add, where the value was lower than the single vision lens (p = 0.015). for the 4.00 d stimulus, differences with single vision lens in peak of velocity and time constant were only found with purevision low add, where the peak velocity value was higher and the time constant was lower (p = 0.024 and p = 0.032 for peak of velocity and time constant, respectively); for amplitude of pupil constriction differences were not found (p > 0.05). conclusions. data obtained in this pilot study suggest that in young observers, the multifocal cls studied do not induce large changes in accommodative system compared with the single vision lens. dynamics of accommodation (far-to-near focus) and disaccommodation (near-to-far focus) are described as a function of response amplitude. accommodative responses to step stimuli of various amplitudes presented in real space were measured in eight 20-30 year old subjects. responses were fitted with exponential functions to determine amplitude, time constant and peak velocity. despite the intersubject variability, the results show that time constants of accommodation and peak velocity of disaccommodation increase with amplitude in all subjects. the dynamics of accommodation and disaccommodation are dependent on amplitude, but have different properties in each case.
the reasons why it is effective to estimate the chlorophyll-a concentration with the ratio of spectral radiance reflectance at the red light region and near infrared regions were shown in theory using a two-flow model. it was found that all of the backscattering coefficients can consequently be ignored by using the ratio of spectral radiance reflectance, which is the ratio of the upward radiance to the downward irradiance, at the red light and near infrared regions. in other words, the ratio can be expressed by using only absorption coefficients, which are more stable for measurement than backscattering coefficients. in addition, the band selection is crucial for producing the band ratio when the chlorophyll-a concentration is estimated without the effects of backscattering. i conclude that the two wavelengths selected must be close, but one must be within the absorption range of chlorophyll-a, and the other must be outside of the absorption range of chlorophyll-a, in order to accurately estimate the chlorophyll-a concentration. a new uv submersible spectroradiometer has been employed to determine the diffuse attenuation coefficient for irradiance in the clearest natural waters [k(w)(lambda)] with emphasis on the spectral region from 300 to 400 nm. k(w)(lambda) can be related to the inherent optical properties of pure water, in particular the total absorption coefficient a(w)(lambda) and the molecular scattering coefficient b(m)(lambda), by means of equations derived from radiative transfer theory. we present an analysis showing that limiting values of k(w)(lambda) can be estimated from a(w)(lambda) and vice versa. published a(w)(lambda) data, which show discrepancies much larger than their estimated accuracies, are briefly reviewed and then compared, via our analysis, with k(w)(lambda) data (our own new and previously published data as well as relevant data of others). this comparative analysis and new data allow a consistent and accurate set of optical properties for the clearest natural waters and for pure fresh water and saltwater to be estimated from 300 to 800 nm.
purpose. this work introduces a distinct sonographic classification of achilles tendon ruptures which has proven itself to be a reliable instrument for an individualized and differentiated therapy selection for patients who have suffered an achilles tendon rupture. materials and methods. from january 1, 2000 to december 31, 2005, 273 patients who suffered from a complete subcutaneous rupture of the achilles tendon (asr) were clinically and sonographically evaluated. the sonographic classification was organized according to the location of the rupture, the contact of the tendon ends, and the structure of the interposition between the tendon ends. results. in 266 of 273 (97.4%) patients the sonographic classification of the rupture of the achilles tendon was recorded. type 1 was detected in 54 patients (19.8%), type 2a in 68 (24.9%), type 2b in 33 (12.1%), type 3a in 20 (7.3%), type 3b in 61 (22.3%), type 4 in 20 (7.3%), and type 5 in 10 (3.7%). of the patients with type 1 and fresh asr, 96% (n = 47) were treated nonoperative-functionally, and 4% (n = 2) were treated by percutaneous suture with the dresden instrument (pdi suture). of the patients classified as type 2a with fresh asr, 31 patients (48%) were treated nonoperatively-functionally and 33 patients (52%) with percutaneous suture with the dresden instrument (pdi suture). of the patients with type 3b and fresh asr, 94% (n = 34) were treated by pdi suture and 6% (n = 2) by open suture according to kirchmayr and kessler. conclusion. unlike the clinical classification of the achilles tendon rupture, the sonographic classification is a guide for deriving a graded and differentiated therapy from a broad spectrum of treatments. objective minimally invasive suture of the torn achilles tendon without opening the rupture site, reduction in the risk of a sural nerve lesion, and optimization of stump apposition.   indications fresh achilles tendon rupture.   contraindications chronic achillodynia, local corticoid injections, immunosuppressive therapy, old achilles tendon ruptures, rerupture.   surgical technique suture of the achilles tendon with a special instrument via a skin incision proximal to the rupture, without opening the peritenon or the rupture site, whereby the suture in the area of the proximal achilles tendon is placed in the layer between the lower-leg fascia and the peritenon with the threads running in a paratendinous direction.   results from january 1, 2000 to december 31, 2003, 61 patients with 62 achilles tendon ruptures were sutured using the percutaneous technique with the dresden instrument. no sural nerve lesions and only two reruptures (3.2%) were observed. in one patient (1.6%) a superficial late infection occurred after 8 weeks, when the tendon was already healed. of 47 patients with a follow-up time of at least 1 year, 39 with 40 achilles tendon ruptures were followed up (83%). according to the criteria of trillat & mounier-kuhn, the result was very good in 62% and good in 30%. on the aofas score, an average of 96 points (78-100 points) was achieved. 78% of the patients assessed the result of the treatment as very good and 20% as good.
purposethree-column osteotomy (3co), including pedicle subtraction osteotomy (pso) and vertebral column resection (vcr), can provide powerful alignment correction for adult cervical deformity (acd). our objective was to assess alignment changes and early complications associated with 3co for acd.methodsacd patients treated with 3co with minimum 90-day follow-up were identified from a prospectively collected multicenter acd database. complications within 90-days of surgery and pre- and postoperative radiographs were collected.resultsall 23 acd patients treated with 3co (14 pso/9 vcr) had minimum 90-day follow-up (mean age 62.3 years, previous cervical/cervicothoracic instrumentation in 52.2% and thoracic/thoracolumbar instrumentation in 47.8%). the primary diagnosis was kyphosis in 91.3% and coronal deformity in 8.7%. the mean number of fusion levels was 12 (range 6–18). the most common 3co levels were t1 (39.1%), t2 (30.4%) and t3 (21.7%). eighteen (12 major/6 minor) complications affected 13 (56.5%) patients. the most common complications were neurologic deficit (17.4%), wound infection (8.7%), distal junctional kyphosis (djk 8.7%), and cardiorespiratory failure (8.7%). three (13.0%) patients required re-operation within 90-days (1 each for nerve root motor deficit, djk, and implant pain/prominence). cervical alignment improved significantly following 3co, including cervical lordosis (−2.8° to −12.9°, p = 0.036), c2-7 sagittal vertical axis (64.6–42.3 mm, p < 0.001), and t1 slope minus cervical lordosis (46.4°–27.0°, p < 0.001).conclusionsamong 23 acd patients treated with 3co, cervical alignment improved significantly following surgery. thirteen (56.5%) patients had at least one complication. the most common complications were neurologic deficit, infection, djk, and cardiorespiratory failure. sagittal spinal misalignment (ssm) is an established cause of pain and disability. treating physicians must be familiar with the radiographic findings consistent with ssm. additionally, the restoration or maintenance of physiological sagittal spinal alignment after reconstructive spinal procedures is imperative to achieve good clinical outcomes. the c-7 plumb line (sagittal vertical axis) has traditionally been used to evaluate sagittal spinal alignment; however, recent data indicate that the measurement of spinopelvic parameters provides a more comprehensive assessment of sagittal spinal alignment. in this review the authors describe the proper analysis of spinopelvic alignment for surgical planning. online videos supplement the text to better illustrate the key concepts.
purposeprecise needle placement is an important task during several medical procedures. ultrasound imaging is often used to guide the needle toward the target region in soft tissue. this task remains challenging due to the user’s dependence on image quality, limited field of view, moving target, and moving needle. in this paper, we present a novel dual-robot framework for robotic needle insertions under robotic ultrasound guidance.methodwe integrated force-controlled ultrasound image acquisition, registration of preoperative and intraoperative images, vision-based robot control, and target localization, in combination with a novel needle tracking algorithm. the framework allows robotic needle insertion to target a preoperatively defined region of interest while enabling real-time visualization and adaptive trajectory planning to provide safe and quick interactions. we assessed the framework by considering both static and moving targets embedded in water and tissue-mimicking gelatin.resultsthe presented dual-robot tracking algorithms allow for accurate needle placement, namely to target the region of interest with an error around 1 mm.conclusionto the best of our knowledge, we show the first use of two independent robots, one for imaging, the other for needle insertion, that are simultaneously controlled using image processing algorithms. experimental results show the feasibility and demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the process. in both photoacoustic (pa) and ultrasonic (us) imaging, overall image quality is influenced by the optical and acoustical properties of the medium. consequently, with the increased use of combined pa and us (paus) imaging in preclinical and clinical applications, the ability to provide phantoms that are capable of mimicking desired properties of soft tissues is critical. to this end, gelatin-based phantoms were constructed with various additives to provide realistic acoustic and optical properties. forty-micron, spherical silica particles were used to induce acoustic scattering, intralipid® 20% iv fat emulsion was employed to enhance optical scattering and ultrasonic attenuation, while india ink, direct red 81, and evans blue dyes were utilized to achieve optical absorption typical of soft tissues. the following parameters were then measured in each phantom formulation: speed of sound, acoustic attenuation (from 6 to 22 mhz), acoustic backscatter coefficient (from 6 to 22 mhz), optical absorption (from 400 nm to 1300 nm), and optical scattering (from 400 nm to 1300 nm). results from these measurements were then compared to similar measurements, which are offered by the literature, for various soft tissue types. based on these comparisons, it was shown that a reasonably accurate tissue-mimicking phantom could be constructed using a gelatin base with the aforementioned additives. thus, it is possible to construct a phantom that mimics specific tissue acoustical and/or optical properties for the purpose of paus imaging studies.
background pharmacological intervention of redox balance in cancer cells often results in oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis, attracting much attention for the development of a new generation of targeted therapy in cancer. however, little is known about mechanisms underlying the conversion from oxidative signaling to downstream activities leading cells to death. methodology/principal findings we here report a systematic detection of transcriptome changes in response to oxidative signals generated in leukemia cells upon fenretinide treatment, implicating the occurrence of numerous stress-responsive events during the fenretinide induced apoptosis, such as redox response, endoplasmic reticulum stress/unfolded protein response, translational repression and proteasome activation. moreover, the configuration of these relevant events is primarily orchestrated by stress responsive transcription factors, as typically highlighted by nf-e2-related factor-2 (nrf2) and heat shock factor 1 (hsf1). several lines of evidence suggest that the coordinated regulation of these transcription factors and thus their downstream genes are involved in converting oxidative signaling into downstream stress-responsive events regulating pro-apoptotic and apoptotic activities at the temporal and spatial levels, typifying oxidative stress-mediated programmed death rather than survival in cancer cells. conclusions/significance this study provides a roadmap for understanding oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells, which may be further developed into more sophisticated therapeutic protocols, as implicated by synergistic induction of cell apoptosis using proteasome inhibitors with fenretinide. background the lipid second messenger ceramide, which is generated by acidic and neutral sphingomyelinases or ceramide synthases, is a common intermediate of many apoptotic pathways. metabolism of ceramide involves several enzymes, including glucosylceramide synthase and gd3 synthase, and results in the formation of gangliosides (gm3, gd3, and gt3), which in turn promote the generation of reactive oxygen species (ros) and apoptosis. fenretinide, a retinoic acid derivative, is thought to induce apoptosis via increases in ceramide levels, but the link between ceramide and subsequent apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells is unclear.   methods sh-sy5y and htla230 neuroblastoma cells were treated with fenretinide in the presence or absence of inhibitors of enzymes important in ceramide metabolism (fumonisin b1, inhibitor of ceramide synthase; desipramine, inhibitor of acidic and neutral sphingomyelinases; and pdmp, inhibitor of glucosylceramide). small interfering rnas were used to specifically block acidic sphingomyelinase or gd3 synthase activities. apoptosis, ros, and gd3 expression were measured by flow cytometry.   results in neuroblastoma cells, ros generation and apoptosis were associated with fenretinide-induced increased levels of ceramide, glucosylceramide synthase activity, gd3 synthase activity, and gd3. fenretinide also induced increased levels of gd2, a ganglioside derived from gd3. inhibition of acidic sphingomyelinase but not of neutral sphingomyelinase or ceramide synthase, blocked fenretinide-induced increases in ceramide, ros, and apoptosis. exogenous gd3 induced ros and apoptosis in sh-sy5y cells but not in sh-sy5y cells treated with baicalein, a specific 12-lipoxygenase inhibitor. exogenous gd2 did not induce apoptosis.   conclusions a novel pathway of fenretinide-induced apoptosis is mediated by acidic sphingomyelinase, glucosylceramide synthase, and gd3 synthase, which may represent targets for future drug development. gd3 may be a key signaling intermediate leading to apoptosis via the activation of 12-lipoxygenase.

this study used the modality shift experiment, a relatively simple reaction time measure to visual and auditory stimuli, to examine attentional shifting within and across modalities in 33 children and 42 adults with high-functioning autism as compared to matched numbers of age- and ability-matched typical controls. an exaggerated “modality shift effect” relative to the td children occurred for the children with autism in conditions involving the reaction time when shifting from sound to light but not from light to sound. no exaggerated mse was found for the adults with autism; rather, their responses were characterized by a generalized slowness relative to the adults with td. these results suggest a lag in maturational development in autism in basic information processing mechanisms. the autism diagnostic observation schedule—generic (ados-g) is a semistructured, standardized assessment of social interaction, communication, play, and imaginative use of materials for individuals suspected of having autism spectrum disorders. the observational schedule consists of four 30-minute modules, each designed to be administered to different individuals according to their level of expressive language. psychometric data are presented for 223 children and adults with autistic disorder (autism), pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (pddnos) or nonspectrum diagnoses. within each module, diagnostic groups were equivalent on expressive language level. results indicate substantial interrater and test—retest reliability for individual items, excellent interrater reliability within domains and excellent internal consistency. comparisons of means indicated consistent differentiation of autism and pddnos from nonspectrum individuals, with some, but less consistent, differentiation of autism from pddnos. a priori operationalization of dsm-iv/icd-10 criteria, factor analyses, and roc curves were used to generate diagnostic algorithms with thresholds set for autism and broader autism spectrum/pdd. algorithm sensitivities and specificities for autism and pddnos relative to nonspectrum disorders were excellent, with moderate differentiation of autism from pddnos.
in this paper, we propose a support vector machine with automatic confidence (svmac) for gender classification based on facial images. namely, we explore how to incorporate confidence values introduced in each primitive training sample and compute these values automatically into machine learning. in the proposed svmac, we use both the labels of training samples and the label confidence which projected by a monotonic function as input. the main contribution of svmac is that the confidence value of each training sample is calculated by some common algorithms, such as svm, neural network and so on, for gender classification. experimental results demonstrate that svmac can improve classification accuracy dramatically. in this work, we present a novel approach to face recognition which considers both shape and texture information to represent face images. the face area is first divided into small regions from which local binary pattern (lbp) histograms are extracted and concatenated into a single, spatially enhanced feature histogram efficiently representing the face image. the recognition is performed using a nearest neighbour classifier in the computed feature space with chi square as a dissimilarity measure. extensive experiments clearly show the superiority of the proposed scheme over all considered methods (pca, bayesian intra/extrapersonal classifier and elastic bunch graph matching) on feret tests which include testing the robustness of the method against different facial expressions, lighting and aging of the subjects. in addition to its efficiency, the simplicity of the proposed method allows for very fast feature extraction.
advances in technology-enabled dietary assessment include the advent of web-based food frequency questionnaires, which may reduce costs and researcher burden but may introduce new challenges related to internet connectivity and computer literacy. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the intra- and inter-version reliability, feasibility and acceptability of the paper and web canadian diet history questionnaire ii (cdhq-ii) in a sub-sample of 648 adults (aged 39–81 years) recruited from alberta’s tomorrow project. participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: (1) paper, web, paper; or (2) web, paper, web over a six-week period. with few exceptions, no statistically significant differences in mean nutrient intake were found in the intra- and inter-version reliability analyses. the majority of participants indicated future willingness to complete the cdhq-ii online, and 59% indicated a preference for the web over the paper version. findings indicate that, in this population of adults drawn from an existing cohort, the cdhq-ii may be administered in paper or web modalities (increasing flexibility for questionnaire delivery), and the nutrient estimates obtained with either version are comparable. we recommend that other studies explore the feasibility and reliability of different modes of administration of dietary assessment instruments prior to widespread implementation. multiple-day food records or 24-hour recalls are currently used as "reference" instruments to calibrate food frequency questionnaires (ffqs) and to adjust findings from nutritional epidemiologic studies for measurement error. the common adjustment is based on the critical requirements that errors in the reference instrument be independent of those in the ffq and of true intake. when data on urinary nitrogen level, a valid reference biomarker for nitrogen intake, are used, evidence suggests that a dietary report reference instrument does not meet these requirements. in this paper, the authors introduce a new model that includes, for both the ffq and the dietary report reference instrument, group-specific biases related to true intake and correlated person-specific biases. data were obtained from a dietary assessment validation study carried out among 160 women at the dunn clinical nutrition center, cambridge, united kingdom, in 1988-1990. using the biomarker measurements and dietary report measurements from this study, the authors compare the new model with alternative measurement error models proposed in the literature and demonstrate that it provides the best fit to the data. the new model suggests that, for these data, measurement error in the ffq could lead to a 51% greater attenuation of true nutrient effect and the need for a 2.3 times larger study than would be estimated by the standard approach. the implications of the results for the ability of ffq-based epidemiologic studies to detect important diet-disease associations are discussed.
introductionduring the past decade, substantial evidence has documented that opioid receptor heterodimers form in cell lines expressing one or more opioid receptors. more recent studies have begun to investigate whether heterodimer formation also occurs in vivo.objectiveswe have used opioid receptor knockout mice to determine whether the in vivo intrathecal (i.t.) pharmacological potency of delta, kappa, and bivalent kappa/delta ligands is altered in the absence of the kor-1 and/or dor-1 genes.resultswe observe that both norbni (a kappa antagonist) and kdn-21 (a kappa/delta bivalent antagonist) specifically inhibit dpdpe but not deltorphin ii i.t potency in wild-type mice but that following mutation of kor-1, the ability of either compound to reduce dpdpe potency is lost. in contrast, knockout of kor-1 unexpectedly slightly reduces the potency of deltorphin ii (delta2) but not dpdpe (delta1). finally, two compounds with kappa agonist activity, 6′-gnti (a putative kappa/delta heterodimer selective agonist) and kdan-18 (kappa agonist/delta antagonist bivalent ligand) show reduced potency in dor-1 ko mice.conclusionsthese results show, genetically, that bivalent ligands with kappa agonist activity require delta receptors for maximal potency in vivo, which is consistent with the presence of opioid heterodimer/oligomer complexes in vivo, and also highlight the complexity of delta drug action even when complementary pharmacologic and genetic approaches are used. despite ample pharmacological evidence for the existence of multiple mu-, delta- and kappa-opioid receptor subtypes, only three genes encoding mu-(mor), delta-(dor) and kappa-(kor) opioid receptor have been cloned. the kor gene encodes kappa(1)-sites, which specifically bind arylacetamide compounds, and the possible existence of kappa-opioid receptor subtypes derived from another kappa-opioid-receptor gene, yet to be characterized, remains a very contentious issue. kappa(2)-opioid receptors are described as binding sites typically labelled by the non-selective benzomorphan ligand [3h]bremazocine in the presence of mu-, delta- and kappa(1)-opioid receptor blocking ligands. to investigate the genetic origin of kappa(2)-opioid receptors, we have carried out homogenate binding experiments with [3h]bremazocine in brains of single mor-, dor-, kor- and double mor/dor-deficient mice. scatchard analysis showed that 68+/-12% of the binding sites arise from the mor gene, 27+/-1% from the dor gene and 14.5+/-0.2% from the kor gene, indicating that the three known genes account for total [3h]bremazocine binding. experiments in the presence of mu-, delta- and kappa(1)-opioid receptor suppressor ligands further showed that non-kappa(1)-opioid receptor labelling can be accounted for by binding to both the mu- and delta-opioid receptors. finally, [3h]bremazocine binding experiments performed on brain membranes from the triple mor/dor/kor-deficient mice revealed a complete absence of binding sites, confirming definitively that no additional gene is required to explain the total population of [3h]bremazocine binding sites. altogether the data show that the putative kappa(2)-opioid receptors are in fact a mixed population of kor, dor and predominantly mor gene products.
study objective we seek to assess the performance of the β human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hcg) "discriminatory zone" when using bedside pelvic ultrasonography in the evaluation of symptomatic pregnant emergency department (ed) patients.   methods this was a cross-sectional study of bedside pelvic ultrasonography performed on consecutive pregnant patients in the first trimester who presented to the ed with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding. patients received pelvic ultrasonography, serum β-hcg testing, and blinded formal radiologic ultrasonography. all patients were followed for 8 weeks to determine outcomes. the sensitivity and specificity of a discriminatory β-hcg level of 3,000 miu/ml for the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy were calculated for patients without an intrauterine pregnancy visualized by bedside ultrasonography.   results thirty-six faculty physicians performed bedside pelvic ultrasonography on 256 patients. there were 161 cases with a confirmed visualizable intrauterine pregnancy and 29 ectopic pregnancies. bedside ultrasonography identified 115 intrauterine pregnancies. the range of β-hcg for cases of confirmed visualizable intrauterine pregnancy with a nondiagnostic bedside ultrasonography was 15 miu/ml to 123,368 miu/ml (median 6,633; interquartile range 1,551 to 32,699). for patients with nondiagnostic bedside ultrasonography, using a discriminatory β-hcg level of 3,000 miu/ml to further assess for ectopic pregnancy showed sensitivity of 35% (95% confidence interval [ci] 18% to 54%) and specificity of 58% (95% ci 48% to 67%). finally, the overall sensitivity of bedside pelvic ultrasonography for the detection of intrauterine pregnancy was 71% (95% ci 63% to 78%), and the specificity was 99% (95% ci 94% to 100%).   conclusion when bedside pelvic ultrasonography does not demonstrate an intrauterine pregnancy, serum β-hcg level is not helpful in differentiating intrauterine from ectopic pregnancy in symptomatic ed patients. the most reliable ultrasonographic criteria for diagnosing ectopic pregnancy are based on the appearance of the uterus in the presence of a positive urine pregnancy test. the absence of an intrauterine sac signifies ectopic pregnancy, whereas its presence indicates intrauterine gestation. these criteria cannot be applied when serum pregnancy tests are used unless the serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg) level at which the sac of an intrauterine pregnancy becomes visible on ultrasound is known, because these tests are far more sensitive and identify pregnancy at an earlier stage than does sonar. in this study, the hcg level that distinguishes patients with intrauterine pregnancies in whom a gestational sac can be seen from those in whom it cannot be seen was determined and designated the discriminatory hcg zone. this zone lies between 6000 and 6500 mlu/ml. the absence of an intrauterine sac in conjunction with hcg values above this level signifies ectopic pregnancy; however, the absence of an intrauterine sac has no diagnostic significance when associated with hcg values below the discriminatory zone. an intrauterine sac associated with hcg levels above the discriminatory zone reliably indicates an intrauterine pregnancy, but at hcg values below the zone, it is suggestive of an abnormal pregnancy—either a missed abortion or an ectopic gestation.
background mild therapeutic hypothermia following cardiac arrest is neuroprotective, but its effect on myocardial dysfunction that is a critical issue following resuscitation is not clear. this study sought to examine whether hypothermia and the combination of hypothermia and pharmacological postconditioning are cardioprotective in a model of cardiopulmonary resuscitation following acute myocardial ischemia. methodology/principal findings thirty pigs (28–34 kg) were subjected to cardiac arrest following left anterior descending coronary artery ischemia. after 7 minutes of ventricular fibrillation and 2 minutes of basic life support, advanced cardiac life support was started according to the current aha guidelines. after successful return of spontaneous circulation (n = 21), coronary perfusion was reestablished after 60 minutes of occlusion, and animals were randomized to either normothermia at 38°c, hypothermia at 33°c or hypothermia at 33°c combined with sevoflurane (each group n = 7) for 24 hours. the effects on cardiac damage especially on inflammation, apoptosis, and remodeling were studied using cellular and molecular approaches. five animals were sham operated. animals treated with hypothermia had lower troponin t levels (p<0.01), reduced infarct size (34±7 versus 57±12%; p<0.05) and improved left ventricular function compared to normothermia (p<0.05). hypothermia was associated with a reduction in: (i) immune cell infiltration, (ii) apoptosis, (iii) il-1β and il-6 mrna up-regulation, and (iv) il-1β protein expression (p<0.05). moreover, decreased matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity was detected in the ischemic myocardium after treatment with mild hypothermia. sevoflurane conferred additional protective effects although statistic significance was not reached. conclusions/significance hypothermia reduced myocardial damage and dysfunction after cardiopulmonary resuscitation possible via a reduced rate of apoptosis and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. volatile anesthetics exert cardioprotective properties in experimental and clinical studies. we designed this study to investigate the effects of sevoflurane on left ventricular (lv) performance during minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass grafting (midcab) without cardiopulmonary bypass. fifty-two patients scheduled for midcab surgery were randomly assigned to a propofol or a sevoflurane group. apart from the anesthetics used, there was no difference in surgical and anesthetic management. after determination of cardiac troponin t, creatine kinase, and creatine kinase mb, electrocardiographic (ecg) data and echocardiography variables (myocardial performance index and early to atrial filling velocity ratio) the left anterior descending coronary artery (lad) was clamped until anastomosis with the left internal mammary artery was completed. during lad occlusion and during reperfusion, echocardiography measurements were repeated. blood samples were obtained repeatedly for up to 72 h. after lad occlusion, myocardial performance index and early to atrial filling velocity ratio in the propofol group deteriorated significantly from 0.40 ± 0.12 and 1.29 ± 0.35 to 0.49 ± 0.10 and 1.13 ± 0.22, respectively, whereas there was no change in the sevoflurane group. in the propofol group myocardial performance index remained increased (0.47 ± 0.11) compared with baseline during reperfusion. there were no significant differences in ecg and laboratory values between groups. in conclusion, during a brief period of ischemia in patients undergoing midcab surgery, sevoflurane preserved myocardial function better than propofol.
defensins comprise a family of cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides with important roles in innate and adaptive immune defense in vertebrates. we characterized alpha and beta defensin genes in three australian marsupials: the tasmanian devil (sarcophilus harrisii), koala (phascolarctos cinereus), and tammar wallaby (macropus eugenii) and identified 48, 34, and 39 defensins, respectively. one hundred and twelve have the classical antimicrobial peptides characteristics required for pathogen membrane targeting, including cationic charge (between 1+ and 15+) and a high proportion of hydrophobic residues (>30%). phylogenetic analysis shows that gene duplication has driven unique and species-specific expansions of devil, koala, and tammar wallaby beta defensins and devil alpha defensins. defensin genes are arranged in three genomic clusters in marsupials, whereas further duplications and translocations have occurred in eutherians resulting in four and five gene clusters in mice and humans, respectively. marsupial defensins are generally under purifying selection, particularly residues essential for defensin structural stability. certain hydrophobic or positively charged sites, predominantly found in the defensin loop, are positively selected, which may have functional significance in defensin-target interaction and membrane insertion. backgroundthe thymus plays a critical role in the development and maturation of t-cells. humans have a single thoracic thymus and presence of a second thymus is considered an anomaly. however, many vertebrates have multiple thymuses. the tammar wallaby has two thymuses: a thoracic thymus (typically found in all mammals) and a dominant cervical thymus. researchers have known about the presence of the two wallaby thymuses since the 1800s, but no genome-wide research has been carried out into possible functional differences between the two thymic tissues. here, we used pyrosequencing to compare the transcriptomes of a cervical and thoracic thymus from a single 178 day old tammar wallaby.resultswe show that both the tammar thoracic and the cervical thymuses displayed gene expression profiles consistent with roles in t-cell development. both thymuses expressed genes that mediate distinct phases of t-cells differentiation, including the initial commitment of blood stem cells to the t-lineage, the generation of t-cell receptor diversity and development of thymic epithelial cells. crucial immune genes, such as chemokines were also present. comparable patterns of expression of non-coding rnas were seen. 67 genes differentially expressed between the two thymuses were detected, and the possible significance of these results are discussed.conclusionthis is the first study comparing the transcriptomes of two thymuses from a single individual. our finding supports that both thymuses are functionally equivalent and drive t-cell development. these results are an important first step in the understanding of the genetic processes that govern marsupial immunity, and also allow us to begin to trace the evolution of the mammalian immune system.
gloeobacter violaceus, the most primordial of known organisms performing oxygenic photosynthesis, evolved before the evolutionary appearance of thylakoid membranes. this study demonstrates the presence of bioenergetic domains in its cytoplasmic membrane. the formation of these membrane domains might constitute evolutionary precursors of the thylakoid membrane. the light reactions of oxygenic photosynthesis almost invariably take place in the thylakoid membranes, a highly specialized internal membrane system located in the stroma of chloroplasts and the cytoplasm of cyanobacteria. the only known exception is the primordial cyanobacterium gloeobacter violaceus, which evolved before the appearance of thylakoids and harbors the photosynthetic complexes in the plasma membrane. thus, studies on g. violaceus not only shed light on the evolutionary origin and the functional advantages of thylakoid membranes but also might include insights regarding thylakoid formation during chloroplast differentiation. based on biochemical isolation and direct in vivo characterization, we report here structural and functional domains in the cytoplasmic membrane of a cyanobacterium. although g. violaceus has no internal membranes, it does have localized domains with apparently specialized functions in its plasma membrane, in which both the photosynthetic and the respiratory complexes are concentrated. these bioenergetic domains can be visualized by confocal microscopy, and they can be isolated by a simple procedure. proteomic analysis of these domains indicates their physiological function and suggests a protein sorting mechanism via interaction with membrane-intrinsic terpenoids. based on these results, we propose specialized domains in the plasma membrane as evolutionary precursors of thylakoids. kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (kegg) is a knowledge base for systematic analysis of gene functions in terms of the networks of genes and molecules. the major component of kegg is the pathway database that consists of graphical diagrams of biochemical pathways including most of the known metabolic pathways and some of the known regulatory pathways. the pathway information is also represented by the ortholog group tables summarizing orthologous and paralogous gene groups among different organisms. kegg maintains the genes database for the gene catalogs of all organisms with complete genomes and selected organisms with partial genomes, which are continuously re-annotated, as well as the ligand database for chemical compounds and enzymes. each gene catalog is associated with the graphical genome map for chromosomal locations that is represented by java applet. in addition to the data collection efforts, kegg develops and provides various computational tools, such as for reconstructing biochemical pathways from the complete genome sequence and for predicting gene regulatory networks from the gene expression profiles. the kegg databases are daily updated and made freely available (http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/).
the intestine exerts a considerable influence over urinary oxalate in two ways, through the absorption of dietary oxalate and by serving as an adaptive extra-renal pathway for elimination of this waste metabolite. knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for oxalate absorption and secretion by the intestine therefore have significant implications for understanding the etiology of hyperoxaluria, as well as offering potential targets for future treatment strategies for calcium oxalate kidney stone disease. in this review, we present the recent developments and advances in this area over the past 10 years, and put to the test some of the new ideas that have emerged during this time, using human and mouse models. a key focus for our discussion are the membrane-bound anion exchangers, belonging to the slc26 gene family, some of which have been shown to participate in transcellular oxalate absorption and secretion. this has offered the opportunity to not only examine the roles of these specific transporters, revealing their importance to oxalate homeostasis, but to also probe the relative contributions made by the active transcellular and passive paracellular components of oxalate transport across the intestine. we also discuss some of the various physiological stimuli and signaling pathways which have been suggested to participate in the adaptation and regulation of intestinal oxalate transport. finally, we offer an update on research into oxalobacter formigenes, alongside recent investigations of other oxalate-degrading gut bacteria, in both laboratory animals and humans. active transcellular oxalate transport in the mammalian intestine contributes to the homeostasis of this important lithogenic anion. several members of the slc26a gene family of anion exchangers have a measurable oxalate affinity and are expressed along the gut, apically and basolaterally. mouse slc26a6 (pat1) targets to the apical membrane of enterocytes in the small intestine, and its deletion results in net oxalate absorption and hyperoxaluria. apical exchangers of the slc26a family that mediate oxalate absorption have not been established, yet the slc26a3 [downregulated in adenoma (dra)] protein is a candidate mediator of oxalate uptake. we evaluated the role of dra in intestinal oxalate and cl(-) transport by comparing unidirectional and net ion fluxes across short-circuited segments of small (ileum) and large (cecum and distal colon) intestine from wild-type (wt) and dra knockout (ko) mice. in wt mice, all segments demonstrated net oxalate and cl(-) absorption to varying degrees. in ko mice, however, all segments exhibited net anion secretion, which was consistently, and solely, due to a significant reduction in the absorptive unidirectional fluxes. in ko mice, daily urinary oxalate excretion was reduced 66% compared with that in wt mice, while urinary creatinine excretion was unchanged. we conclude that dra mediates a predominance of the apical uptake of oxalate and cl(-) absorbed in the small and large intestine of mice under short-circuit conditions. the large reductions in urinary oxalate excretion underscore the importance of transcellular intestinal oxalate absorption, in general, and, more specifically, the importance of the dra exchanger in oxalate homeostasis.
background: prior attempts to quantify the pivot-shift examination have been too invasive or impractical for clinical use. a noninvasive method for quantifying rotatory knee laxity is needed. hypothesis: greater quantitative measurements of rotatory knee laxity (both of the involved knee as well as compared with the contralateral healthy knee) are associated with an increasing clinical pivot-shift grade. study design: cross-sectional study; level of evidence, 3. methods: a total of 103 patients undergoing anatomic single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (acl) reconstruction at 4 international centers underwent a standardized pivot-shift test preoperatively on both knees while anesthetized. clinical grading of the pivot shift was performed according to the international knee documentation committee (ikdc) knee ligament rating system. two different quantitative technologies were used to measure rotatory knee laxity: an inertial sensor and an image analysis were independently used to measure tibial acceleration and lateral compartment translation, respectively, during the pivot-shift test. patients were dichotomized to “high-grade” (abnormal and severely abnormal) or “low-grade” (normal and nearly normal) rotatory knee laxity groups based on the clinical pivot-shift test result of the involved side. tibial acceleration and lateral compartment translation of the involved knee and the side-to-side difference between the involved and contralateral knees were separately compared between the high- and low-grade rotatory knee laxity groups utilizing t tests; significance was set at p < .05. results: forty-three patients were in the low-grade rotatory knee laxity group, and 60 patients were in the high-grade rotatory knee laxity group. patients in the high-grade knee laxity group had significantly higher lateral compartment translation as measured with the image analysis (involved knee: 3.8 ± 2.3 mm; side-to-side difference: 2.5 ± 2.4 mm) compared with patients in the low-grade group (involved knee: 2.0 ± 1.4 mm; side-to-side difference: 1.4 ± 1.5 mm) (both p < .01). as measured with the inertial sensor, tibial acceleration for patients in the high-grade group was significantly higher (involved knee: 7.2 ± 5.3 m/s2; side-to-side difference: 4.2 ± 5.4 m/s2) compared with patients in the low-grade group (involved knee: 4.2 ± 1.6 m/s2; side-to-side difference: 1.2 ± 1.2 m/s2) (both p < .01). conclusion: the inertial sensor and image analysis techniques were able to detect differences between low- and high-grade pivot-shift test results. a quantitative assessment of the pivot-shift test could augment the diagnosis of an acl injury and improve the ability to detect changes in rotatory knee laxity over time. purposealthough various kinematic measurements with advanced technology have been used for quantitative evaluation of the pivot shift test, there is no clinically available quantification method of the pivot shift test. the purpose was to describe a novel image analysis technique for quantitative assessment of the pivot shift test using universally available and affordable devices.methodsfive acl deficient knees were tested during examination under anesthesia. three skin markers were attached to bony landmarks on the lateral side of the knee joint, (1) gerdy’s tubercle, (2) fibular head, and (3) lateral epicondyle. a standard digital video camera captured motion of the lateral aspect of the knee during the pivot shift test. the image was processed into a 2-dimensional (2-d) coordinate system with image j software (national institute of health, usa) to trace the three landmarks. the anteroposterior (ap) position of the femur was calculated on consecutive still images extracted from the video recording. ap translation over time was reported.resultsthe reduction phase of the pivot shift could be tracked consistently by a sudden anterior translation of the distal femur. the sudden anterior translation of the lateral epicondyle was on average 3.7 ± 2.1 mm and occurred within 0.2 ± 0.1 s from the start of this anterior translation till the end.conclusionthe sudden shift of the lateral compartment of the knee joint was successfully detected by this newly developed image analysis measurement method. this image analysis technique facilitates a simple and affordable method to evaluate the lateral pivot shift test.level of evidencediagnostic studies, level iv.
in this paper, we propose to analyze the pre- and post-processing steps applied in the context of cross-lingual dependency transfer. to this aim, we employ a simple transfer strategy that operates on partially annotated projected data. we show that a good data selection strategy is a key point in successfully transferring dependencies and that better data selection techniques need to be developed in order to achieve the performance of fully supervised methods. most current dependency parsers presuppose that input words have been morphologically disambiguated using a part-of-speech tagger before parsing begins. we present a transition-based system for joint part-of-speech tagging and labeled dependency parsing with non-projective trees. experimental evaluation on chinese, czech, english and german shows consistent improvements in both tagging and parsing accuracy when compared to a pipeline system, which lead to improved state-of-the-art results for all languages.
environmental and occupational exposure to heavy metals such as cadmium, mercury and lead results in severe health hazards including prenatal and developmental defects. the deleterious effects of heavy metal ions have hitherto been attributed to their interactions with specific, particularly susceptible native proteins. here, we report an as yet undescribed mode of heavy metal toxicity. cd2+, hg2+ and pb2+ proved to inhibit very efficiently the spontaneous refolding of chemically denatured proteins by forming high-affinity multidentate complexes with thiol and other functional groups (ic(50) in the nanomolar range). with similar efficacy, the heavy metal ions inhibited the chaperone-assisted refolding of chemically denatured and heat-denatured proteins. thus, the toxic effects of heavy metal ions may result as well from their interaction with the more readily accessible functional groups of proteins in nascent and other non-native form. the toxic scope of heavy metals seems to be substantially larger than assumed so far. the molecular chaperone proteins, particularly hsp60 and hsp70, have been implicated in essential cell functions under both normal and stress conditions (reviewed in refs 15). members of the family of heat-shock proteins ofm r70k, hsp70, bind to unfolded proteins and short peptides613. addition of mgatp results in the dissociation of the substrate polypeptides from the chaperone711, but as atp-γs (an atp analogue that is only slowly hydrolysable) cannot substitute for atp in this reaction7,9,11, it has been concluded that atp hydrolysis is necessary to dissociate hsp70substrate protein complexes. by independently measuring the rates of atp hydrolysis and substrate protein dissociation, we show here that mgatp binding but not mgatp hydrolysis is essential for substrate dissociation. we also show that there is an absolute requirement for k+for the effect of mgatp: only the combination of k+ and mgatp will cause the conformational change in hspto that is necessary for substrate dissociation. moreover, in the absence of k+, mgatp favours complex formation. we consider these results in terms of a g-protein-like model.
the manifestations of hand ischemia because of an arteriovenous access can range from hand pain, tissue necrosis, and loss of the entire hand. recent data have emphasized that multiple mechanisms (arterial steal, ie, retrograde flow, arterial stenosis, and arterial calcification) are responsible for inducing hand ischemia. because any or a combination of the 3 mechanisms can lead to peripheral ischemia, distal hypoperfusion ischemic syndrome is a more appropriate term to denote hand ischemia. a detailed history, physical examination, and differential diagnosis form the initial step in the management of distal hypoperfusion ischemic syndrome. a complete arteriogram to evaluate the circulation of the extremity from the aortic arch to the palmar arch is essential. the choice of treatment modality should be based on this evaluation. in this article, we review the pathophysiology and present current strategies to ameliorate distal hypoperfusion ischemic syndrome. unlabelled the purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of the vcs vascular clip approximating system for the creation of hemodialysis access fistulas. 173 new vascular accesses were created, 92 prosthetic grafts and 81 autologous fistulas over a 40-month period. 50 sutured and 42 clipped fistulas comprised the prosthetic graft series, and 33 sutured and 48 clipped cases the autologous series. risk factors associated with access patency were correlated and the primary patencies compared in the suture versus clipped group. a significant improvement in primary patency was noted for the clipped prosthetic group at all time points studied, with a positive trend also noted for clipped autologous fistulae.   conclusions the vascular clipping system (the vcs system) provides both long-term and immediate advantages for vascular access construction. clips have been used successfully to treat seven consecutive patients with upper extremity arterial steal syndrome without the technical difficulties associated with traditional methods of repair.
backgroundmicrornas (mirnas) have been shown to regulate the expression of a large number of genes and play key roles in many biological processes. several previous studies have quantified the inhibitory effect of a mirna indirectly by considering the expression levels of genes that are predicted to be targeted by the mirna and this approach has been shown to be robust to the choice of prediction algorithm. given a gene expression dataset, cheng et al. defined the regulatory effect score (re-score) of a mirna as the difference in the gene expression rank of targets of the mirna compared to non-targeted genes.resultsusing microarray data from parent-offspring trios from the international hapmap project, we show that the re-score of most mirnas is correlated between parents and offspring and, thus, inter-individual variation in re-score has a genetic component in humans. indeed, the mean re-score across mirnas is correlated between parents and offspring, suggesting genetic differences in the overall efficiency of the mirna biogenesis pathway between individuals. to explore the genetics of this quantitative trait further, we carried out a genome-wide association study of the mean re-score separately in two hapmap populations (ceu and yri). no genome-wide significant associations were discovered; however, a snp rs17409624, in an intron of drosha, was significantly associated with mean re-score in the ceu population following permutation-based control for multiple testing based on all snps mapped to the canonical mirna biogenesis pathway; of 244 individual mirna re-scores assessed in the ceu, 214 were associated (p < 0.05) with rs17409624. the snp was also nominally significantly associated (p = 0.04) with mean re-score in the yri population. interestingly, the same snp was associated with 17 (8.5% of all expressed) mirna expression levels in the ceu. we also show here that the expression of the targets of most mirnas is more highly correlated with global changes in mirna regulatory effect than with the expression of the mirna itself.conclusionswe present evidence that mirna regulatory effect is a heritable trait in humans and that a polymorphism of the drosha gene contributes to the observed inter-individual differences. backgroundover the last few years, genome-wide association (gwa) studies became a tool of choice for the identification of loci associated with complex traits. currently, imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (snp) data are frequently used in gwa analyzes. correct analysis of imputed data calls for the implementation of specific methods which take genotype imputation uncertainty into account.resultswe developed the probabel software package for the analysis of genome-wide imputed snp data and quantitative, binary, and time-till-event outcomes under linear, logistic, and cox proportional hazards models, respectively. for quantitative traits, the package also implements a fast two-step mixed model-based score test for association in samples with differential relationships, facilitating analysis in family-based studies, studies performed in human genetically isolated populations and outbred animal populations.conclusionsprobabel package provides fast efficient way to analyze imputed data in genome-wide context and will facilitate future identification of complex trait loci.
introduction while there is much information about the burden of influenza a(h1n1)pdm09 in north america, little data exist on its burden in south america. methods during april to december 2009, we actively searched for persons with severe acute respiratory infection and influenza-like illness (ili) in three sentinel cities. a proportion of case-patients provided swabs for influenza testing. we estimated the number of case-patients that would have tested positive for influenza by multiplying the number of untested case-patients by the proportion who tested positive. we estimated rates by dividing the estimated number of case-patients by the census population after adjusting for the proportion of case-patients with missing illness onset information and ili case-patients who visited physicians multiple times for one illness event. results we estimated that the influenza a(h1n1)pdm09 mortality rate per 100,000 person-years (py) ranged from 1.5 among persons aged 5–44 years to 5.6 among persons aged ≥65 years. a(h1n1)pdm09 hospitalization rates per 100,000 py ranged between 26.9 among children aged <5 years to 41.8 among persons aged ≥65 years. influenza a(h1n1)pdm09 ili rates per 100 py ranged between 1.6 among children aged <5 to 17.1 among persons aged 45–64 years. while 9 (53%) of 17 influenza a(h1n1)pdm09 decedents with available data had obesity and 7 (17%) of 40 had diabetes, less than 4% of surviving influenza a(h1n1)pdm09 case-patients had these pre-existing conditions (p≤0.001). conclusion influenza a(h1n1)pdm09 caused a similar burden of disease in argentina as in other countries. such disease burden suggests the potential value of timely influenza vaccinations. we applied a reverse transcription (rt)-pcr assay for influenza a virus to combined nasal wash-throat swab specimens previously obtained from an outpatient pediatric population with acute respiratory illness during concurrent epidemics of influenza a virus and respiratory syncytial virus. the results of the rt-pcr assay were compared with those previously reported with virus cultivation and commercially available rapid diagnostic kits (e.a. dominguez, l.h. taber, and r.b. couch, j. clin. microbiol. 31:2286-2290, 1993). with virus cultivation as the "gold standard", the rt-pcr assay had a sensitivity, specificity, and efficiency of 95, 98, and 97%, respectively, compared with 75, 100, and 93%, respectively, for the best diagnostic kit (becton dickinson directigen). rt-pcr is an effective alternative to virus isolation for the detection of influenza a virus in clinical specimens.
the aim of this study was to examine the influence of the performance level of athletes on pacing strategy during a simulated 10-km running race, and the relationship between physiological variables and pacing strategy. twenty-four male runners performed an incremental exercise test on a treadmill, three 6-min bouts of running at 9, 12 and 15 km h−1, and a self-paced, 10-km running performance trial; at least 48 h separated each test. based on 10-km running performance, subjects were divided into terziles, with the lower terzile designated the low-performing (lp) and the upper terzile designated the high-performing (hp) group. for the hp group, the velocity peaked at 18.8 ± 1.4 km h−1 in the first 400 m and was higher than the average race velocity (p < 0.05). the velocity then decreased gradually until 2,000 m (p < 0.05), remaining constant until 9,600 m, when it increased again (p < 0.05). the lp group ran the first 400 m at a significantly lower velocity than the hp group (15.6 ± 1.6 km h−1; p > 0.05) and this initial velocity was not different from lp average racing velocity (14.5 ± 0.7 km h−1). the velocity then decreased non-significantly until 9,600 m (p > 0.05), followed by an increase at the end (p < 0.05). the peak treadmill running velocity (pv), running economy (re), lactate threshold (lt) and net blood lactate accumulation at 15 km h−1 were significantly correlated with the start, middle, last and average velocities during the 10-km race. these results demonstrate that high and low performance runners adopt different pacing strategies during a 10-km race. furthermore, it appears that important determinants of the chosen pacing strategy include pv, lt and re. abstractfield and laboratory studies were made on 16 trained distance runners to determine the relationship between selected metabolic measurements and distance running performance. measurements were made for oxygen consumption, heart rate, and blood lactate accumulation during submaximal and maxima
in humans we know 25 selenoproteins that play important roles in redox regulation, detoxification, immune-system protection and viral suppression. in particular, selenoprotein m (selm) may function as thiol disulfide oxidoreductase that participates in the formation of disulfide bonds, and can be implicated in calcium responses. however, it presents a redox motif (cxxu), where u is a selenocysteine, and may also function as redox regulator because its decreased or increased expression regulated by dietary selenium alters redox homeostasis. no data are reported in literature about its involvement in cancer but only in neurodegenerative diseases. in this paper we evaluated the selm expression in two hepatoma cell lines, hepg2 and huh7, compared to normal hepatocytes. the results suggested its involvement in hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) as well as its possible use to follow the progression of this cancer as putative marker. the aim of this study has been to analyze the structure-function relationships of selm. hence, firstly we studied the evolutionary history of this protein by phylogenetic analysis and gc content of genes from various species. so, we modeled the three-dimensional structure of the human selm evaluating its energetic stability by molecular dynamics simulations. moreover, we modeled some of its mutants to obtain structural information helpful for structure-based drug design. selenoproteins contain the trace element selenium incorporated as selenocysteine, the 21st amino acid. some members of the selenoprotein family, such as the glutathione peroxidases, have well-characterized antioxidant activity, functioning in enzymatic breakdown of hydroperoxides to protect cells against oxidative stress. however, the functions of many of the 25 human selenoproteins, including the brain-enriched selenoprotein m, are unknown. we investigated selenoprotein m function by manipulating expression in murine hippocampal ht22 cells, cerebellar astrocyte c8-d1a cells, and primary neuronal cultures. overexpression of the protein resulted in a reduction in reactive oxygen species and apoptotic cell death in response to oxidative challenge with hydrogen peroxide. in contrast, knock-down of selenoprotein m using shrna in primary neuronal cultures caused apoptotic cell death comparable to levels resulting from addition of hydrogen peroxide. calcium measurements with the indicator cameleon demonstrated that overexpression of selenoprotein m decreased calcium influx in response to hydrogen peroxide. additionally, knock-down of selenoprotein m expression in cortical cultures caused higher baseline levels of cytosolic calcium than in control cells. these results suggest that selenoprotein m may have an important role in protecting against oxidative damage in the brain and may potentially function in calcium regulation.
athletes require sufficient nutrition knowledge and skills to enable appropriate selection and consumption of food and fluids to meet their health, body composition, and performance needs. this article reports the nutrition knowledge and dietary habits of male football (soccer) players in australia. players age 18 years and older were recruited from 1 a-league club (professional) and 4 national premier league clubs (semiprofessional). no significant difference in general nutrition knowledge (gnk; 54.1% ± 13.4%; 56.8% ± 11.7%; m ± sd), t(71) = -0.91, p = .37, or sports nutrition knowledge (snk; 56.9% ± 15.5%; 61.3% ± 15.9%), t(71) = -1.16, p = .25) were noted between professional (n = 29) and semiprofessional (n = 44) players. in general, players lacked knowledge in regard to food sources and types of fat. although nutrition knowledge varied widely among players (24.6-82.8% correct responses), those who had recently studied nutrition answered significantly more items correctly than those who reported no recent formal nutrition education (62.6% ± 11.9%; 54.0% ± 11.4%), t(67) = 2.88, p = .005). analysis of 3-day estimated food diaries revealed both professionals (n = 10) and semiprofessionals (n = 31) consumed on average less carbohydrate (3.5 ± 0.8 gc/kg; 3.9 ± 1.8 gc/kg) per day than football-specific recommendations (fifa medical and assessment research centre [f-marc]: 5-10 gc/kg). there was a moderate, positive correlation between snk and carbohydrate intake (n = 41, ρ = 0.32, p = .04), indicating that players who exhibited greater snk had higher carbohydrate intakes. on the basis of these findings, male football players in australia would benefit from nutrition education targeting carbohydrate and fat in an attempt to improve nutrition knowledge and dietary practices. nutrition knowledge is believed to influence nutritional intake, which in turn influences performance in elite athletes. there is currently no published data on the nutrition knowledge of elite australian football (af) players. the purpose of this study was to gain insight into the current level of general and sports nutrition knowledge in elite male af athletes. forty six elite male af players (23.5 ± 2.8 years) answered 123 questions relating to five areas of nutrition knowledge: dietary recommendations, sources of nutrients, choosing everyday foods, alcohol and sports nutrition. demographic details and perceptions of nutrition knowledge were collected for all participants. the mean nutrition knowledge score was 74.4 ± 10.9 (60.5%). the highest score was obtained in sports nutrition section (17.9 ± 3.0, 61.7%). the dietitian was selected as the first source of information by 98% of athletes, with club trainer and teammates as second choice for 45.7% and 23.9% of athletes, respectively. the majority of athletes correctly answered questions regarding recommendations to increase fruit and vegetable intake and decrease fat intake (95.6%, 91.1% and 93.3% correct respectively). while 80% of the athletes were aware fat intake should predominately be made up of unsaturated fat, they were less able to identify food sources of unsaturated fats (35.6% and 24.4% correct for statements regarding monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, respectively). broad nutrition messages and recommendations appear to be well understood; however, gaps in nutrition knowledge are evident. a better understanding of nutrition knowledge in athletes will allow nutrition education interventions to target areas in need of improvement.
the effort to personalize treatment plans for cancer patients involves the identification of drug treatments that can effectively target the disease while minimizing the likelihood of adverse reactions. in this study, the gene-expression profile of 810 cancer cell lines and their response data to 368 small molecules from the cancer therapeutics research portal (ctrp) are analyzed to identify pathways with significant rewiring between genes, or differential gene dependency, between sensitive and non-sensitive cell lines. identified pathways and their corresponding differential dependency networks are further analyzed to discover essentiality and specificity mediators of cell line response to drugs/compounds. for analysis we use the previously published method eddy (evaluation of differential dependency). eddy first constructs likelihood distributions of gene-dependency networks, aided by known genegene interaction, for two given conditions, for example, sensitive cell lines vs. non-sensitive cell lines. these sets of networks yield a divergence value between two distributions of network likelihoods that can be assessed for significance using permutation tests. resulting differential dependency networks are then further analyzed to identify genes, termed mediators, which may play important roles in biological signaling in certain cell lines that are sensitive or non-sensitive to the drugs. establishing statistical correspondence between compounds and mediators can improve understanding of known gene dependencies associated with drug response while also discovering new dependencies. millions of compute hours resulted in thousands of these statistical discoveries. eddy identified 8,811 statistically significant pathways leading to 26,822 compound-pathway-mediator triplets. by incorporating stitch and string databases, we could construct evidence networks for 14,415 compound-pathway-mediator triplets for support. the results of this analysis are presented in a searchable website to aid researchers in studying potential molecular mechanisms underlying cells' drug response as well as in designing experiments for the purpose of personalized treatment regimens. in this paper we develop a new data structure for implementing heaps (priority queues). our structure, fibonacci heaps (abbreviated f-heaps), extends the binomial queues proposed by vuillemin and studied further by brown. f-heaps support arbitrary deletion from an n-item heap in 0(log n) amortized time and all other standard heap operations in 0(1) amortized time. using f-heaps we are able to obtain improved running times for several network optimization algorithms.
oligomers and polymers of flavan-3-ols (proanthocyanidins) are very abundant in the mediterranean diet, but are poorly absorbed. however, when these polyphenols reach the colon, they are metabolised by the intestinal microbiota into various phenolic acids, including phenylpropionic, phenylacetic and benzoic acid derivatives. since the biological properties of these metabolites are not completely known, in the present study, we investigated the effect of the following microbial phenolic metabolites: 3,4-dihydroxyphenylpropionic acid (3,4-dhppa), 3-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (3,4-dhpaa), 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-hydroxyhippuric acid (4-hha), on modulation of the production of the main pro-inflammatory cytokines (tnf-α, il-1β and il-6). the production of these cytokines by lipopolysaccharide (lps)-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) pre-treated with the phenolic metabolites was studied in six healthy volunteers. with the exception of 4-hha for tnf-α secretion, only the dihydroxylated compounds, 3,4-dhppa and 3,4-dhpaa, significantly inhibited the secretion of these pro-inflammatory cytokines in lps-stimulated pbmc. mean inhibition of the secretion of tnf-α by 3,4-dhppa and 3,4-dhpaa was 84·9 and 86·4 %, respectively. the concentrations of il-6 in the culture supernatant were reduced by 88·8 and 92·3 % with 3,4-dhppa and 3,4-dhpaa pre-treatment, respectively. finally, inhibition was slightly higher for il-1β, 93·1 % by 3,4-dhppa and 97·9 % by 3,4-dhpaa. these results indicate that dihydroxylated phenolic acids derived from microbial metabolism present marked anti-inflammatory properties, providing additional information about the health benefits of dietary polyphenols and their potential value as therapeutic agents. to analyze adhesion molecule expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) and on different lymphocyte subpopulations (cd2+, cd8+, cd19+, and cd56+ subsets) in chronic alcoholism, 30 well-nourished chronic alcoholics without ethanol-related diseases and 30 matched controls were included in the study. adhesion molecules that mediate adhesion to other cells and to extracellular matrix proteins, and whose cellular expression is modified during lymphocyte activation, were selected for study. a detailed clinical evaluation, laboratory analysis, nutritional assessment, and study of adhesion molecule expression was performed. a significant higher expression of cd29 (beta1-integrin) (p = 0.001), vla-3 (p = 0.002), vla-4 (p = 0.03), and vla-5 (p = 0.001) were observed on pbmcs of chronic alcoholics, compared with control subjects, whereas no changes were observed in cd18 (beta2-integrin) and cd50 (icam-3) expression. the upregulation of cd29 and vla proteins only affected t lymphocytes (cd2+/cd8+/cd4+ cells). these data confirm that t cells of chronic alcoholics are basally activated and that changes in adhesion molecule expression on pbmcs may be responsible of disturbances of adhesion processes in chronic alcoholics without ethanol-related diseases.
through the years, different studies showed the involvement of protein kinase c (pkc) in cell cycle control, in particular during g1/s transition. little is known about their role at g2/m checkpoint. in this study, using k562 human erythroleukemia cell line, we found a novel and specific mechanism through which the conventional isoform pkc⍺ positively affects cyclin b1 modulating g2/m progression of cell cycle. since the kinase activity of this pkc isoform was not necessary in this process, we demonstrated that pkc⍺, physically interacting with cyclin b1, avoided its degradation and stimulated its nuclear import at mitosis. moreover, the process resulted to be strictly connected with the increase in nuclear diacylglycerol levels (dag) at g2/m checkpoint, due to the activity of nuclear phospholipase c β1 (plcβ1), the only plc isoform mainly localized in the nucleus of k562 cells. taken together, our findings indicated a novel dag dependent mechanism able to regulate the g2/m progression of the cell cycle. p21cip1/waf1 is the principle mediator of cell cycle arrest in response to dna damage. p21 primarily mediates g1 cell cycle arrest by inactivating g1-associated cyclin a- and cyclin e-containing cyclin/cdk complexes. in the present study we investigate the role of p21 in dna damage-induced g2 cell cycle arrest, particularly with respect to the g2-associated cyclin, cyclin b1. we demonstrate that cells lacking p21 or deficient in their ability to upregulate p21 are unable to mediate the downregulation of cyclin b1 in response to dna damage as compared to wild-type cells. decreased levels of cyclin b1 in response to dna damage seen in wild-type cells is due to p21-mediated degradation of cyclin b1 as this can be inhibited by a proteasomal inhibitor. cell cycle analysis reveals that p21-null cells are unable sustain g2 cell cycle arrest and accumulate at greater than 4n dna content. these results indicate that p21-mediated degradation of cyclin b1 in response to dna damage is necessary for the maintenance of g2 cell cycle arrest.
sexual size dimorphism varies substantially among populations and species but we have little understanding of the sources of selection generating this variation. we used path analysis to study how oviposition host affects selection on body size in a seed‐feeding beetle (stator limbatus) in which males contribute large ejaculates (nuptial gifts) to females. females use nutrients in these ejaculates for egg production. male body size, which affects ejaculate size, affects female fecundity and is thus under fecundity selection similar in magnitude to the fecundity selection on female body size. we show that when eggs are laid on a host on which larval mortality is low (seeds of acacia greggii) fecundity predicts fitness very well and fecundity selection is the major source of selection on both male and female adult size. in contrast, when eggs are laid on a host on which larval mortality is high (seeds of parkinsonia florida) fecundity poorly predicts fitness such that fecundity selection is relaxed on both male and female size. however, because egg size affects larval mortality on this poor host (p. florida) there is selection on female size via the female size → egg size → fitness path; this selection via egg size offsets the reduction in fecundity selection on female, but not male, body size. thus, differences in host suitability (due to differences in larval mortality) affect the relative importance of two sources of selection on adult body size; fecundity selection on both male and female body size is lower on the poor quality host (p. florida) relative to the high quality host (a. greggii) whereas selection on female body size via effects of egg size on offspring survival (body size → egg size → fitness) is greater on the poor quality host relative to the high quality host. because selection via the egg size path affects only females the difference in larval survival between hosts shifts the relative magnitude of selection on female vs. male size. researchers working on other study systems should be alerted to the possible importance of subtle, but consequential, indirect selection on their study organisms. plants can vary substantially among species in morphological and physiological traits that influence their resistance to herbivores and their quality for herbivore growth and development. seeds of the desert trees cercidium floridum and c. microphyllum vary within and among populations in their resistance to, and suitability for, growth and development of larvae of the seed beetle, stator limbatus. we examined how this variation influences the magnitude of natural selection on the size of eggs laid by beetles and tested whether female beetles can distinguish between seeds of more vs. less suitable trees (within species). we found that selection favoring large eggs differed substantially between the two tree species (greater on c. floridum) and varied substantially among populations of c. floridum and among trees (within populations) of both c. floridum and c. microphyllum. in general, the magnitude of selection favoring large eggs correlated positively with seed coat resistance between tree species, among populations within species, and among trees within populations. female s. limbatus are capable of distinguishing seeds of the two host species and respond to species differences in selection by laying larger eggs on seeds of c. floridum than on seeds of c. microphyllum. however, despite large variation in seed suitability within populations of trees, females did not preferentially lay eggs on seeds of less resistant trees, nor did they adjust egg size in response to variation in resistance among trees.
objectivethe aim of the present study was to establish the usefulness of the fronto-basal approach with a relatively small craniotomy window for the removal of tumors protruding from the sellar–suprasellar region to the third and basal cistern.methodforty-two patients who were surgically treated for craniopharyngiomas extending outside the sellar–suprasellar region were evaluated. all the patients were operated on by the fronto-basal interhemispheric approach, and the average follow-up period was 5 years.resultsgross total resection of the lesion was achieved in 30 cases. eight patients underwent subtotal resection and four patients underwent partial removal due to recurrence after previous surgeries with or without radiotherapy. in the immediate postoperative period, major complications, including impairment of the cranial nerves, were observed in two cases. one patient exhibited transient memory disturbance due to infarction of the perforator; after 3 months, this symptom was ameliorated. three of the patients died during follow-up; however, 6 of the 30 undergoing gross total removal and 10 of the 12 patients undergoing subtotal or partial removal suffered regrowth. ultimately, a total of 12 patients underwent re-operation with the same approach or combined with the orbito-zygomatic approach.conclusionin our experience, the fronto-basal interhemispheric approach, even through a small craniotomy window, is a valid choice for the removal of craniopharyngiomas extending outside the sellar–suprasellar region. using this approach, tumors can be removed without significant sequelae related to surgical technique due to easy preservation of the pituitary stalk, hypothalamic structures, and perforators. this approach offers a safe and minimally invasive means of treating craniopharyngiomas. object craniopharyngiomas frequently grow from remnants of the rathke pouch, which is located on the cisternal surface of the hypothalamic region. these lesions can also extend elsewhere in the infundibulohypophyseal axis. the aim of this study was to establish the usefulness of the frontobasal approach made through a relatively small craniotomy window for the removal of tumors protruding from the sellar-suprasellar region into the third and basal cistern.   methods thirty-one patients who were surgically treated for craniopharyngiomas extending outside the sellar-suprasellar region were evaluated. the diagnoses were established in all cases by using magnetic resonance and computerized tomography imaging. the initial symptoms and signs were increased intracranial pressure in eight, vision impairment or visual field defect in 16, hypopituitarism in 17, and psychological disturbances in three cases. all patients underwent surgery via the frontobasal interhemispheric approach, and the average follow-up period was 30 months. total removal of the lesion was achieved in 22 cases, six patients underwent subtotal resection, and three underwent partial removal due to tumor recurrence after previous surgeries performed with or without adjunctive radiotherapy. major complications, including impairment of the cranial nerves, were not observed in the immediate postoperative period. one patient exhibited transient memory disturbance due to infarction of the perforating vessels; after 3 months this symptom was ameliorated. none of the patients died during long-term follow up; however, four of the 22 who underwent total removal and six of the nine patients who underwent subtotal or partial removal suffered recurrence. of the 10 patients with recurrence, six experienced a small recurrence of the lesion (average 3 months postsurgery); after gamma knife surgery (gks), the size of two of the lesions was unchanged and in four reoperation was performed due to tumor enlargement during the follow-up period. ultimately, a total of eight patients (four with recurrence and four who had been treated with gks) underwent reoperation, with gross-total removal via the same approach or combined with the orbitozygomatic approach in patients with very short optic nerves. in no patient was deterioration of visual acuity and visual field observed after surgery. although all patients except four children and one adult were receiving some form of hormone replacement therapy, their endocrine status was stably controllable.   conclusions in the authors' experience, the frontobasal interhemispheric approach, even made through a small craniotomy window, is a valid choice for the removal of craniopharyngiomas extending outside the sellar-suprasellar region. via this approach, tumors can be removed without significant sequelae related to the surgical method, due to ease of preservation of the pituitary stalk, hypothalamic structures, and perforating vessels. this approach offers a safe and minimally invasive means of treating craniopharyngiomas.
over 360 million people worldwide suffer from disabling hearing loss. most of them can be treated with hearing aids. unfortunately, performance with hearing aids and the benefit obtained from using them vary widely across users. here, we investigate the reasons for such variability. sixty-eight hearing-aid users or candidates were fitted bilaterally with nonlinear hearing aids using standard procedures. treatment outcome was assessed by measuring aided speech intelligibility in a time-reversed two-talker background and self-reported improvement in hearing ability. statistical predictive models of these outcomes were obtained using linear combinations of 19 predictors, including demographic and audiological data, indicators of cochlear mechanical dysfunction and auditory temporal processing skills, hearing-aid settings, working memory capacity, and pretreatment self-perceived hearing ability. aided intelligibility tended to be better for younger hearing-aid users with good unaided intelligibility in quiet and with good temporal processing abilities. intelligibility tended to improve by increasing amplification for low-intensity sounds and by using more linear amplification for high-intensity sounds. self-reported improvement in hearing ability was hard to predict but tended to be smaller for users with better working memory capacity. indicators of cochlear mechanical dysfunction, alone or in combination with hearing settings, did not affect outcome predictions. the results may be useful for improving hearing aids and setting patients’ expectations. the aim of this study was to assess the relative importance of cochlear mechanical dysfunction, temporal processing deficits, and age on the ability of hearing-impaired listeners to understand speech in noisy backgrounds. sixty-eight listeners took part in the study. they were provided with linear, frequency-specific amplification to compensate for their audiometric losses, and intelligibility was assessed for speech-shaped noise (ssn) and a time-reversed two-talker masker (r2tm). behavioral estimates of cochlear gain loss and residual compression were available from a previous study and were used as indicators of cochlear mechanical dysfunction. temporal processing abilities were assessed using frequency modulation detection thresholds. age, audiometric thresholds, and the difference between audiometric threshold and cochlear gain loss were also included in the analyses. stepwise multiple linear regression models were used to assess the relative importance of the various factors for intelligibility. results showed that (a) cochlear gain loss was unrelated to intelligibility, (b) residual cochlear compression was related to intelligibility in ssn but not in a r2tm, (c) temporal processing was strongly related to intelligibility in a r2tm and much less so in ssn, and (d) age per se impaired intelligibility. in summary, all factors affected intelligibility, but their relative importance varied across maskers.
this paper develops a box-particle implementa- tion of cardinalized probability hypothesis density filter to track multiple targets and estimate the unknown number of targets. a box particle is a random sample that occupies a small and controllable rectangular region of nonzero volume in the target state space. in box-particle filter the huge number of traditional point observations is instead by a remarkably reduced number of interval measurements. it decreases the number of particles significantly and reduces the runtime considerably. the proposed algorithm based on box-particle is able to reach a similar accuracy to a sequential monte carlo cardinalized probability hy- pothesis density (smc-cphd) filter with much less computational costs. not only does it propagates the phd, but also propagates the cardinality distribution of target number. therefore, it generates more accurate and stable instantaneous estimates of target number as well as target state than the box-particle probability hypothesis density (bp-phd) filter does especially in dense clutter environ- ment. comparison and analysis based on the simulations in different probability of detection and different clutter rate have been done. the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed algorithm are verified by the simulation results. in this work, a novel approach to nonlinear non-gaussian state estimation problems is presented based on mixtures of uniform distributions with box supports. this class of filtering methods, introduced in the light of interval analysis framework, is called box particle filter (bpf). it has been shown that weighted boxes, estimating the state variables, can be propagated using interval analysis tools combined with particle filtering ideas. in this paper, in the light of the widely used bayesian inference, we present a different interpretation of the bpf by expressing it as an approximation of posterior probability density functions, conditioned on available measurements, using mixture of uniform distributions. this interesting interpretation is theoretically justified. it provides derivation of the bpf procedures with detailed discussions.
we present an extension to the parametrized self-organizing map that allows  the construction of continuous manifolds from noisy, incomplete and not necessarily grid-  organized training data. all three problems are tackled by minimizing the overall smoothness  of a psom manifold. for this, we introduce a matrix which defines a metric in the space of  psom weights, depending only on the underlying grid layout. we demonstrate the method  with several examples, including the kinematics of a pa10 robot arm. we report on two new improvements for the “parameterised sel f-organizing map” (psom). both achieve a significant increase in mapping ac curacy and computational efficiency. for a growing number of training points the use of higher orde r polynomials to construct the psom “mapping manifold” in [7] can suffer fro m the increasing tendency to oscillate between the support points. we propos e here to confine the algorithm to a subset of the training knots, resulting in what we call the “local-psom” algorithm. this allows to avoid the use of highdegree polynomials without sacrificing accuracy. at the same time, the new approach offers a significant saving in required computations. a second way to improve the mapping preciseness makes use of t he superior approximation properties of chebyshev polynomials fo r the psom mapping manifold. the benefits of the two new approaches are demonstrated with t o benchmark problems:(i) approximating a gaussian bell function and (ii) learning of the (forward and inverse) kinematics of a 3 dof robot finger. i n both cases the psom algorithm exhibit an excellent generalisation ability and that already for a very small training set size of 3 3 3 points.
eukaryotic gene control regions are known to be spread throughout non-coding dna sequences which may appear distant from the gene promoter. transcription factors are proteins that coordinately bind to these regions at transcription factor binding sites to regulate gene expression. several tools allow to detect significant co-occurrences of closely located binding sites (cis-regulatory modules, crms). however, these tools present at least one of the following limitations: 1) scope limited to promoter or conserved regions of the genome; 2) do not allow to identify combinations involving more than two motifs; 3) require prior information about target motifs. in this work we present cisminer, a novel methodology to detect putative crms by means of a fuzzy itemset mining approach able to operate at genome-wide scale. cisminer allows to perform a blind search of crms without any prior information about target crms nor limitation in the number of motifs. cisminer tackles the combinatorial complexity of genome-wide cis-regulatory module extraction using a natural representation of motif combinations as itemsets and applying the top-down fuzzy frequent- pattern tree algorithm to identify significant itemsets. fuzzy technology allows cisminer to better handle the imprecision and noise inherent to regulatory processes. results obtained for a set of well-known binding sites in the s. cerevisiae genome show that our method yields highly reliable predictions. furthermore, cisminer was also applied to putative in-silico predicted transcription factor binding sites to identify significant combinations in s. cerevisiae and d. melanogaster, proving that our approach can be further applied genome-wide to more complex genomes. cisminer is freely accesible at: http://genome2.ugr.es/cisminer. cisminer can be queried for the results presented in this work and can also perform a customized cis-regulatory module prediction on a query set of transcription factor binding sites provided by the user. we are given a large database of customer transactions. each transaction consists of items purchased by a customer in a visit. we present an efficient algorithm that generates all significant association rules between items in the database. the algorithm incorporates buffer management and novel estimation and pruning techniques. we also present results of applying this algorithm to sales data obtained from a large retailing company, which shows the effectiveness of the algorithm.
in this paper, we propose a novel fully convolutional two-stream fusion network (fctsfn) for interactiveimage segmentation. the proposed network includes two sub-networks: a two-stream late fusion network (tslfn) that predicts the foreground at a reduced resolution, and a multi-scale refining network (msrn) that refines the foreground at full resolution. the tslfn includes two distinct deep streams followed by a fusion network. the intuition is that, since user interactions are more direct information on foreground/background than the image itself, the two-stream structure of the tslfn reduces the number of layers between the pure user interaction features and the network output, allowing the user interactions to have a more direct impact on the segmentation result. the msrn fuses the features from different layers of tslfn with different scales, in order to seek the local to global information on the foreground to refine the segmentation result at full resolution. we conduct comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets. the results show that the proposed network achieves competitive performance compared to current state-of-the-art interactive image segmentation methods. 1. interactive object selection is a very important research problem and has many applications. previous algorithms require substantial user interactions to estimate the foreground and background distributions. in this paper, we present a novel deep-learning-based algorithm which has much better understanding of objectness and can reduce user interactions to just a few clicks. our algorithm transforms user-provided positive and negative clicks into two euclidean distance maps which are then concatenated with the rgb channels of images to compose (image, user interactions) pairs. we generate many of such pairs by combining several random sampling strategies to model users' click patterns and use them to finetune deep fully convolutional networks (fcns). finally the output probability maps of our fcn-8s model is integrated with graph cut optimization to refine the boundary segments. our model is trained on the pascal segmentation dataset and evaluated on other datasets with different object classes. experimental results on both seen and unseen objects demonstrate that our algorithm has a good generalization ability and is superior to all existing interactive object selection approaches.
the aim of the study was to investigate the effect of co-administration of ascorbic acid and zinc gluconate, which are antioxidant nutrients on brain biochemical changes in wistar rats, exposed to the hot-humid season. fourteen adult male wistar rats weighing 110 g - 186 g, were divided into two groups of seven rats each. the first group, which served as the control was given distilled water (1 ml/kg); rats in the second group served as the experimental animals and were first given ascorbic acid (100 mg/kg) and immediately followed by the administration of zinc (50 mg/kg). the regimens were given once daily and orally by gavage for a period of 28 days. the dry and wet-bulb temperature values were taken; and from the values, relative humidity and heat index was calculated. the rats were sacrificed on day 29 of the administration and evaluated for brain catalase, superoxide dismutase and acetylcholinesterase activities. lipid peroxidation was determined by measuring the malondialdehyde concentration in the brain. the heat index was significantly (p 0.05) of both groups. there were no significant differences in activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and acetylcholinesterase in the brain showed no significant difference (p > 0.05) between the groups. in conclusion, the moderate heat stress during the hot-humid season induced brain biochemical changes in wistar rats, which may be attenuated by co-administration of ascorbic acid and zinc gluconate. the mild yield characteristics of smallholder agropastoral fulani red sokoto goats were evaluated using records obtained from a total of 92 does in 6 herds, collected over a 2-year period. the results indicated that the total yield was 79.8±3.2 kg, the daily yield 0.66±0.03 kg, the peak yield 1.21±0.07 kg and the day of peak production 28.7±2.1 day of lactation. the milk yield characteristics were highly variable with a coefficient of variability of 38.6% to 69.8%. the characteristics were significantly (p<0.01–0.05) influenced by herd, season, parity and litter size of the dam. highly positive and significant (p<0.01) correlations (r = 0.66–0.99) existed between the total yield and the average daily yield, peak yield, initial yield and day 120 yield. a negative and significant (p<0.05) correlation (r = –0.33) was observed between the peak day and the initial yield. the non-homogeneity of the milk yield characteristics in red sokoto does suggests the possibility of improving their daily productivity by selection of high yielding does. selection for higher initial milk yield may also improve other milk yield characteristics.
text categorization and retrieval tasks are often based on a good representation of textual data. departing from the classical vector space model, several probabilistic models have been proposed recently, such as plsa. in this paper, we propose the use of a neural network based, non-probabilistic, solution, which captures jointly a rich representation of words and documents. experiments performed on two information retrieval tasks using the tdt2 database and the trec-8 and 9 sets of queries yielded a better performance for the proposed neural network model, as compared to plsa and the classical tfidf representations. we propose a new hierarchical generative model for textual data, where words may be generated by topic specific distributions at any level in the hierarchy. this model is naturally well-suited to clustering documents in preset or automatically generated hierarchies, as well as categorising new documents in an existing hierarchy. training algorithms are derived for both cases, and illustrated on real data by clustering news stories and categorising newsgroup messages. finally, the generative model may be used to derive a fisher kernel expressing similarity between documents.
the engage project is a game-based virtual environment where students engage in problembased learning experiences centered around computational thinking and broader computer science education learning objectives that require students to participate in cognitively demanding tasks. cognitive load theory (ayres & van gog, 2009; sweller, et al., 1998) provides a robust framework to characterize these cognitive demands as intrinsic and extrinsic load. here we examined the role of three factors that may impact either the intrinsic or extraneous load experienced by students as they work through learning scenarios in the game. spatial orienting ability, previous video game experience, and previous programming experience had differential impacts on game performance based on the type of puzzle and its temporal sequence in the game. the emerging field of the learning sciences is one that is interdisciplinary, drawing on multiple theoretical perspectives and research paradigms so as to build understandings of the nature and conditions of learning, cognition, and development. learning sciences researchers investigate cognition in context, at times emphasizing one more than the other but with the broad goal of developing evidence-based claims derived from both laboratory-based and naturalistic investigations that result in knowledge about how people learn. this work can involve the development of technological tools, curriculum, and especially theory that can be used to understand and support learning. a fundamental assumption of many learning scientists is that cognition is not a thing located within the individual thinker but is a process that is distributed across the knower, the environment in which knowing occurs, and the activity in which the learner participates. in other words, learning, cognition, knowing, and context are irreducibly co-constituted and cannot be treated as isolated entities or processes. if one believes that context matters in terms of learning and cognition, research paradigms that simply examine these processes as isolated variables within laboratory or other impoverished contexts of participation will necessarily lead to an incomplete understanding of their relevance in more naturalistic settings (brown, 1992).1 alternatively, simply observing learning and cognition as they naturally correspondence and requests for reprints should be sent to sasha a. barab, school of education,
the characteristics of mobile environments, with the possibility of frequent disconnections and fluctuating bandwidth, have forced a rethink of traditional middleware. in particular, the synchronous communication paradigms often employed in standard middleware do not appear to be particularly suited to ad hoc environments, in which not even the intermittent availability of a backbone network can be assumed. instead, asynchronous communication seems to be a generally more suitable paradigm for such environments. message oriented middleware for traditional systems has been developed and used to provide an asynchronous paradigm of communication for distributed systems, and, recently, also for some specific mobile computing systems.  in this paper, we present our experience in designing, implementing and evaluating emma (epidemic messaging middleware for ad hoc networks), an adaptation of java message service (jms) for mobile ad hoc environments. we discuss in detail the design challenges and some possible solutions, showing a concrete example of the feasibility and suitability of the application of the asynchronous paradigm in this setting and outlining a research roadmap for the coming years. recent advances in wireless networking technologies and the growing success of mobile computing devices, such as laptop computers, third generation mobile phones, personal digital assistants, watches and the like, are enabling new classes of applications that present challenging problems to designers. mobile devices face temporary loss of network connectivity when they move; they are likely to have scarce resources, such as low battery power, slow cpu speed and little memory; they are required to react to frequent and unannounced changes in the environment, such as high variability of network bandwidth, and in the remote resources availability, and so on. to support designers building mobile applications, research in the field of middleware systems has proliferated. middleware aims at facilitating communication and coordination of distributed components, concealing difficulties raised by mobility from application engineers as much as possible. in this survey, we examine characteristics of mobile distributed systems and distinguish them from their fixed counterpart. we introduce a framework and a categorization of the various middleware systems designed to support mobility, and we present a detailed and comparative review of the major results reached in this field. an analysis of current trends inside the mobile middleware community and a discussion of further directions of research conclude the survey.
there exist many types of visual imagery that span a dynamic range that exceeds what typical displays are able to capture. this implies that some information is lost, and requires schemes for compressing the dynamic range so that images are amenable to viewing on standard display technology. in certain application domains, specialized displays that cover a wider dynamic range are employed including for the display of medical images for diagnostic purposes. in this paper, we present a means of locally adapting the dynamic range of the display as a function of gaze location to allow for visualization of high dynamic range media on standard displays. this allows for viewing visual media over a dynamic range that exceeds limitations of any display, and presents additional value for certain application domains. the implemented system also allows for control over dynamic range globally based on hand gestures. we propose a technique for fusing a bracketed exposure sequence into a high quality image, without converting to high dynamic range (hdr) first. skipping the physically based hdr assembly step simplifies the acquisition pipeline. this avoids camera response curve calibration and is computationally efficient. it also allows for including flash images in the sequence. our technique blends multiple exposures, guided by simple quality measures like saturation and contrast. this is done in a multiresolution fashion to account for the brightness variation in the sequence. the resulting image quality is comparable to existing tone mapping operators.
the array-ol specification model has been introduced to model systematic signal processing applications. this model is multidimensional and allows to express the full potential parallelism of an application: both task and data parallelism. the array-ol language is an expression of data dependences and thus allows many execution orders. in order to execute array-ol applications on distributed architectures, we show here how to project such specification onto the kahn process network model of computation. we show how array-ol code transformations allow to choose a projection adapted to the target architecture. publisher summary this chapter discusses distributed process networks. process networks are networks of sequential processes connected by channels behaving like fifo (first in, first out) queues. these are used in signal and image processing applications that need to run in bounded memory for infinitely long periods of time dealing with possibly infinite streams of data. this chapter discusses distributed implementation of this computation model. the implementation of a distributed process network by using distributed fifos to build the distributed application is discussed. the platform used to support this is the common object request broker architecture (corba) middleware. indeed, each process of the process network can be written in a different language and run on a different hardware, provided that these are supported by the chosen object request broker (orb). in addition of the heterogeneity, implementation presents the following characteristics; automation of data transfer between distributed processes, dynamic and interactive linking of the processes to form the data flow, hybrid data-driven, demand-driven data transfer protocol, with thresholds for load balancing, and the implementation was carried out, such as to enable a distributed or local execution without any change to the program source. a process network deployment and distributed execution is described. the transfer strategies (demand and data driven) are detailed.
objectives in searching for a noninvasive surrogate tissue mimicking the pro-oxidant/proinflammatory hypertensive heart disease (hhd) phenotype, we turned to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs). we tested whether iterations in [ca2+]i, [zn2+]i, and oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes and pbmcs would complement each other, eliciting similar shifts in gene expression profiles in these tissues demonstrable during the preclinical (week 1) and pathological (week 4) stages of aldosterone/salt treatment (aldost).   background inappropriate neurohormonal activation contributes to pathological remodeling of myocardium in hhd associated with aldosteronism. in rats receiving long-term aldost, evidence of reparative fibrosis replacing necrotic cardiomyocytes and coronary vasculopathy appears at week 4 associated with the induction of oxidative stress by mitochondria that overwhelms endogenous, largely zn2+-based, antioxidant defenses. biomarker-guided prediction of risk before the appearance of cardiac pathology would prove invaluable.   methods in pbmcs and cardiomyocytes, quantitation of cytoplasmic free ca2+ and zn2+, h2o2, and 8-iosprostane levels and isolation of ribonucleic acid (rna) and gene expression together with statistical and clustering analyses and confirmation of genes by in situ hybridization and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction were performed.   results compared with controls, at weeks 1 and 4 of aldost, we found comparable increments in [ca2+]i, [zn2+]i, and 8-isoprotane coupled with increased h2o2 production in cardiac mitochondria and pbmcs, together with the common networks of expression profiles dominated by genes involved in oxidative stress, inflammation, and repair. these included 3 central ingenuity pathway-linked genes: p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, a stress-responsive protein; nuclear factor-κb, a redox-sensitive transcription factor and a proinflammatory cascade that it regulates; and transforming growth factor-β1, a fibrogenic cytokine involved in tissue repair.   conclusions significant overlapping demonstrated in the molecular mimicry of pbmcs and cardiomyocytes during preclinical and pathological stages of aldost implies that transcriptional signatures of pbmcs may serve as early noninvasive and novel sentinels predictive of impending pathological remodeling in hhd. non-obese diabetic (nod) mice spontaneously develop autoimmunity to the insulin producing beta cells leading to insulin-dependent diabetes. in this study we developed and used new data analysis and mining approaches on combined proteome and transcriptome (molecular phenotype) data to define pathways affected by abnormalities in peripheral leukocytes of young nod female mice. cells were collected before mice show signs of autoimmunity (age, 2–4 weeks). we extracted both protein and rna from nod and c57bl/6 control mice to conduct both proteome analysis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and transcriptome analysis on affymetrix expression arrays. we developed a new approach to analyze the two-dimensional gel proteome data that included two-way analysis of variance, cluster analysis, and principal component analysis. lists of differentially expressed proteins and transcripts were subjected to pathway analysis using a commercial service. from the list of 24 proteins differentially expressed between strains we identified two highly significant and interconnected networks centered around oncogenes (myc and mycn) and apoptosis-related genes (bcl2 and casp3). the 273 genes with significant strain differences in rna expression levels created six interconnected networks with a significant over-representation of genes related to cancer, cell cycle, and cell death. they contained many of the same genes found in the proteome networks (including myc and mycn). the combination of the eight, highly significant networks created one large network of 272 genes of which 82 had differential expression between strains either at the protein or the rna level. we conclude that new proteome data analysis strategies and combined information from proteome and transcriptome can enhance the insights gained from either type of data alone. the overall systems biology of prediabetic nod mice points toward abnormalities in regulation of the opposing processes of cell renewal and cell death even before there are any clear signatures of immune system activation.
objectivethis study explores socio-economic inequalities in health among mediterranean people aged 50 or higher.methodsthe data used in the analysis come from the survey of health, ageing and retirement in europe, wave 1, release 2; the sample includes 2,671 greek, 2,502 italian and 2,343 spanish persons. seven health indicators are examined using age-sex standardized prevalence rates and logistic regression models. concentration indices are also computed for self-rated health (srh).resultssocio-economic position of individuals declines with age. persons of lower socio-economic position experience worse health in all instances. independently of education and gender, greek persons display the lowest prevalence rates for srh and physical and depressive symptoms, spanish exhibit the highest rates for chronic conditions, and italians perform better regarding functional limitations. within-country analysis shows that the magnitude of socio-economic inequalities in srh is greatest in greece, followed by spain and lastly by italy.conclusionsthe analysis reconfirms the advantage of high over low socio-economic position for all countries and health indicators and proves education as an important correlate compared to wealth and income among the elderly. in belgium, income-related inequality in ill-health among the 65- is present, but reduces significantly as soon as one restricts the analysis to the 65+. the main goal of this paper is to check whether these findings (based on current income) are robust to the income concept used. the analysis is repeated using estimates of permanent income. measured inequality among the 65+ remains very limited, suggesting that the observed findings are not heavily dependent upon the income concept. finally, i suggest an explanation for the observed difference in inequality between the 65- and the 65+. i argue that this difference is likely to be correlated with differences across income groups of (1) sample attrition; and (2) mortality.
in order to investigate last glacial maximum and future climate, we “precalibrate” the intermediate complexity model genie-1 by applying a rejection sampling approach to deterministic emulations of the model. we develop ~1,000 parameter sets which reproduce the main features of modern climate, but not precise observations. this allows a wide range of large-scale feedback response strengths which generally encompass the range of gcm behaviour. we build a deterministic emulator of climate sensitivity and quantify the contributions of atmospheric (±0.93°c, 1σ) vegetation (±0.32°c), ocean (±0.24°c) and sea–ice (±0.14°c) parameterisations to the total uncertainty. we then perform an lgm-constrained bayesian calibration, incorporating data-driven priors and formally accounting for structural error. we estimate climate sensitivity as likely (66% confidence) to lie in the range 2.6–4.4°c, with a peak probability at 3.6°c. we estimate lgm cooling likely to lie in the range 5.3–7.5°c, with a peak probability at 6.2°c. in addition to estimates of global temperature change, we apply our ensembles to derive lgm and 2xco2 probability distributions for land carbon storage, atlantic overturning and sea–ice coverage. notably, under 2xco2 we calculate a probability of 37% that equilibrium terrestrial carbon storage is reduced from modern values, so the land sink has become a net source of atmospheric co2. this paper describes an approach to computing probabilistic assessments of future climate, using a climate model. it clarifies the nature of probability in this context, and illustrates the kinds of judgements that must be made in order for such a prediction to be consistent with the probability calculus. the climate model is seen as a tool for making probabilistic statements about climate itself, necessarily involving an assessment of the model’s imperfections. a climate event, such as a 2^c increase in global mean temperature, is identified with a region of ‘climate-space’, and the ensemble of model evaluations is used within a numerical integration designed to estimate the probability assigned to that region.
objective mild neurocognitive disorders (mnd) affect a subset of hiv+ patients under effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cart). in this study, we used an innovative multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (mri) approach at high-field to assess the presence of micro-structural brain alterations in mnd+ patients. methods we enrolled 17 mnd+ and 19 mnd− patients with undetectable hiv-1 rna and 19 healthy controls (hc). mri acquisitions at 3t included: mp2rage for t1 relaxation times, magnetization transfer (mt), t2* and susceptibility weighted imaging (swi) to probe micro-structural integrity and iron deposition in the brain. statistical analysis used permutation-based tests and correction for family-wise error rate. multiple regression analysis was performed between mri data and (i) neuropsychological results (ii) hiv infection characteristics. a linear discriminant analysis (lda) based on mri data was performed between mnd+ and mnd− patients and cross-validated with a leave-one-out test. results our data revealed loss of structural integrity and micro-oedema in mnd+ compared to hc in the global white and cortical gray matter, as well as in the thalamus and basal ganglia. multiple regression analysis showed a significant influence of sub-cortical nuclei alterations on the executive index of mnd+ patients (p = 0.04 he and r2 = 95.2). the lda distinguished mnd+ and mnd− patients with a classification quality of 73% after cross-validation. conclusion our study shows micro-structural brain tissue alterations in mnd+ patients under effective therapy and suggests that multi-contrast mri at high field is a powerful approach to discriminate between hiv+ patients on cart with and without mild neurocognitive deficits. objectives: to examine the association between the type and number of subjective memory complaints (smcs) and performance on objective cognitive tests.
rationale. liver toxicity caused by high-dose myeloablative therapy leads to significant morbidity after hematopoietic cell transplantation. we examined the hypothesis that liver toxicity after cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation is related to cyclophosphamide through its metabolism to toxins. objectives. cyclophosphamide was infused at 60 mg/kg over 1–2 hours on each of two consecutive days, followed by total body irradiation. plasma was analyzed for cyclophosphamide and its major metabolites. liver toxicity was scored by development of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (veno-occlusive disease) and by total serum bilirubin levels. the hazards of liver toxicity, non-relapse mortality, tumor relapse, and survival were calculated using regression analysis that included exposure to cyclophosphamide metabolites (as the area under the curve). findings. of 147 patients, 23 (16%) developed moderate or severe sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. the median peak serum bilirubin level through day +20 was 2.6 (range 0.5 to 41.1) mg/dl. metabolism of cyclophosphamide was highly variable, particularly for the metabolite ocarboxyethyl-phosphoramide mustard, whose area under the curve varied 16-fold. exposure to this metabolite was statistically significantly related to sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, bilirubin elevation, non-relapse mortality, and survival, after adjusting for age and irradiation dose. patients in the highest quartile of o-carboxyethyl-phosphoramide mustard exposure had a 5.9-fold higher risk of non-relapse mortality, compared to patients in the lowest quartile. engraftment and tumor relapse were not statistically significantly related to cyclophosphamide metabolite exposure. only. for personal use at penn state university on february 21, 2013. bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org from mcdonald et al page 3 conclusions. increased exposure to toxic metabolites of cyclophosphamide leads to increased liver toxicity and non-relapse mortality and lower overall survival after hematopoietic cell transplant. only. for personal use at penn state university on february 21, 2013. bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org from mcdonald et al page 4 introduction hematopoietic stem cell transplantation following a myeloablative preparative regimen is the treatment of choice for some patients with refractory hematological malignancy, aplastic anemia, and certain inborn errors of metabolism. 1 a major limitation of myeloablative regimens is damage to the liver and development of multi-organ failure, a cause of mortality after transplant. 2-4 in the study reported here, we examined the hypothesis that liver toxicity that develops after a conditioning regimen containing cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation is related to how cyclophosphamide is metabolized. the genesis of this hypothesis came from four observations: 1) cyclophosphamide is a component of the most hepatotoxic myeloablative regimens ; 2) in vitro, hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells are injured by metabolites of cyclophosphamide that are generated within hepatocytes ; 3) damage to the microcirculation of the liver is central to the development of hepatic dysfunction post-transplant. ; 4) there is patient-to-patient variability in cyclophosphamide metabolism and a relation of aberrant metabolism to toxicity in other organs. 9-11 methods patient selection. this was a prospective study of the relationship between cyclophosphamide metabolism and clinical outcome. between april 1997 and january 2000, all patients with hematological malignancy undergoing allogeneic transplants following a preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide (cy) plus total body irradiation were invited to participate. patients signed informed consents approved by our institutional review board. only. for personal use at penn state university on february 21, 2013. bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org from mcdonald et al page 5 technique of hematopoietic cell transplantation. seven days before infusion of stem cells, cy was infused through a central venous access catheter over one to two hours at a dose of 60 mg/kg body weight. on the following day, a second infusion of cy was given, at the same dose. after a day of rest, total body irradiation was given on each of the three or four subsequent days in hyperfractionated doses from opposing cobalt sources. regimens of prophylaxis against graftversus-host disease are given in table 1; bc3 is a murine antibody specific for human cd3. 13 infection prophylaxis included fluconazole or itraconazole, acyclovir, and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. measurement of plasma levels of cyclophosphamide and its metabolites. blood samples were removed from a non-cy infusion port of a central venous access catheter before each cy infusion and at the following times: mid-infusion, immediately after the completion of infusion, and at 1, 3, 7, 20, and 24 hours afterwards. aliquots of each sample were placed into tubes containing either p-nitrophenyl hydrazine for analysis of 4-hydroxy cyclophosphamide or edta for other analytes, mixed, and centrifuged at the bedside. plasma was immediately removed, frozen, and stored at –80 degrees c. until analysis. 14,15 exposure to cy metabolites was expressed as the area under the curve (auc, μm.hr) derived from time zero (the time of the first cy dose) to 24 hours after the second dose of cy. the data reflect exposure to cyclophosphamide (cy) and its metabolites 4-hydroxy-cyclophosphamide (hcy), ocarboxyethyl-phosphoramide mustard (cepm), deschloroethyl-cyclophosphamide (dccy), 4keto-cyclophosphamide (ketocy), and hydroxypropyl-phosphoramide mustard (hppm) (figure 1). only. for personal use at penn state university on february 21, 2013. bloodjournal.hematologylibrary.org from mcdonald et al page 6 we evaluated the relationship between the signs and symptoms of the clinical syndrome called veno-occlusive disease of the liver after bone marrow transplantation and the histological findings in 76 patients who later came to autopsy. coded necropsy liver was scored for individual histological features that were correlated with prospectively assessed clinical features that the patients had exhibited during life. patients were stratified into two groups: those with severe clinical veno-occlusive disease (n = 32) and those without. clinically severe veno-occlusive disease was statistically correlated with several zone 3 acinar changes: occluded hepatic venules, the frequency of occluded hepatic venules x degree of occlusion, eccentric luminal narrowing/phlebosclerosis, zone 3 sinusoidal fibrosis and zone 3 hepatocyte necrosis (all p < or = 0.03). there was a significant relationship between the number of these histological abnormalities in zone 3 of the liver acinus and a clinical diagnosis of severe veno-occlusive disease (p = 0.003). the presence of ascites was significantly correlated with occluded venules, zone 3 sinusoidal fibrosis and zone 3 hepatocyte necrosis (p = 0.001). maximum serum bilirubin in the first 20 days after transplant was significantly correlated with sinusoidal fibrosis, hepatocyte necrosis and eccentric luminal sclerosis/phlebosclerosis (p < 0.01) but not with venular occlusion. the clinical syndrome of liver toxicity (commonly called veno-occlusive disease) that results from cytoreductive therapy before bone marrow transplant is strongly correlated with a constellation of histological lesions involving structures in zone 3 of the liver acinus and the hepatic venules into which sinusoidal blood flows. this study suggests that there is no single diagnostic histological feature. the severity of clinical veno-occlusive disease appears to be proportional to the number of such histological changes and is not due solely to occlusion of small hepatic venules.
backgroundbone resorption in the proximal femur due to stress shielding has been observed in a number of conventional cementless implants used in total hip arthroplasty. short femoral-neck implants are claiming less interference with the biomechanics of the proximal femur. the goal of this study was to prospectively investigate the in vivo changes of bone-mineral density as a parameter of bone remodeling around a short, femoral neck prosthesis over the first 5 years following implantation. the secondary goal was to report on its clinical outcome.methodswe are reporting on the changes of bone mineral density of the proximal femur and the clinical outcome up to five years after implantation of a short femoral neck prosthesis. bone mineral density was determined using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, performed 10 days, three, 12 and 60 months after surgery. 20 patients with a mean age of 47 years (range 17 to 65) were clinically assessed using the harris hip score. the womac was used as a patient-relevant outcome-measure.resultsin contrast to conventional implants dexa-scans overall revealed a slight increase of bone mineral density in the proximal femur in the 12 months following the implantation. the harris hip score improved from an average preoperative score of 46 to a postoperative score at 12 months of 91 points and 95 points at 60 months, the global womac index from 5.3 preoperatively to 0.8 at 12 months and 0.6 at 60 months postoperatively.conclusionat 60 months after implantation of a short femoral neck prosthesis, all regions except one (region of interest #5) showed no significant changes in bmd compared to baseline measurements at 10 days which is less to the changes in bone mineral density seen in conventional implants. our aim was to determine the precision of the measurements of bone mineral density (bmd) by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in the proximal femur before and after implantation of an uncemented implant, with particular regard to the significance of retro- and prospective studies. we examined 60 patients to determine the difference in preoperative bmd between osteoarthritic and healthy hips. the results showed a preoperative bmd of the affected hip which was lower by a mean of 4% and by a maximum of 9% compared with the opposite side. in addition, measurements were made in the operated hip before and at ten days after operation to determine the effect of the implantation of an uncemented custom-made femoral stem. the mean increase in the bmd was 8% and the maximum was 24%. previous retrospective studies have reported a marked loss of bmd on the operated side. the precision of double measurements using a special foot jig showed a modified coefficient of variation of 0.6% for the non-operated side in 15 patients and of 0.6% for the operated femur in 20 patients. the effect of rotation on the precision of the measurements after implantation of an uncemented femoral stem was determined in ten explanted femora and for the operated side in ten patients at 10 degrees rotation and in 20 patients at 30 degrees rotation. rotation within 30 degrees influenced the precision in studies in vivo and in vitro by a mean of 3% and in single cases in up to 60%. precise prediction of the degree of loss of bmd is thus only possible in prospective cross-sectional measurements, since the effect of the difference in preoperative bmd, as well as the apparent increase in bmd after implantation of an uncemented stem, is not known from retrospective studies. the dexa method is a reliable procedure for determining periprosthetic bmd when positioning and rotation are strictly controlled.
the emergency department is a fast-paced, information intensive environment that can benefit from improved information management. the presentation will discuss how an integrated information system infrastructure can support providers to deliver high-quality patient care, optimize operational activities, and facilitate clinical and informatics research studies in an emergency care setting. illustrative examples will include improvement of pneumonia-care processes, implementation of asthma guidelines, and forecasting emergency department overcrowding. towards intelligent telemedicine services multi-label classification methods are increasingly required by modern applications, such as protein function classification, music categorization, and semantic scene classification. this article introduces the task of multi-label classification, organizes the sparse related literature into a structured presentation and performs comparative experimental results of certain multilabel classification methods. it also contributes the definition of concepts for the quantification of the multi-label nature of a data set.
backgroundthe relationship of spirometric values to other respiratory and functional parameters in advanced age is not well studied. we assessed this relationship in elderly subjects with either good or poor spirometric parameters to reveal whether different domains of lung function show comparable differences between the two groups.methodsamong subjects of the population-based kora-age cohort (n = 935, 65-90y; 51% male) two groups were selected from either the lower (led; n = 51) or the upper (ued; n = 72) end of the fev1 distribution. all subjects did not have a history of lung disease and were non-smokers at the time of the study. measurements included spirometry, body plethysmography, diffusing capacity for no and co, respiratory pump function and exhaled no (feno). in addition, 6-min walking distance as a functional overall measure, as well as telomere length of blood leukocytes and serum 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-ohdg) as potential markers of overall biological ageing and stress were determined.resultsin the majority of parameters, led subjects showed significantly impaired values compared to ued subjects. differences in spirometric parameters, airway resistance and respiratory pump function ranged between 10% and more than 90% in terms of predicted values. in contrast, volume-related co and no diffusing capacity showed differences between groups of lower than 5%, while telomere length, 8-ohdg and feno were similar. this was reflected in the differences in “functional age” as derived from prediction equations.conclusionsin elderly subjects without a history of lung disease differences in spirometric parameters were associated with differences in other lung-mechanical parameters including body plethysmography but not with differences in volume-corrected gas exchange measures. thus, the concept of a general “lung age” as suggested by the widespread use of this term in connection with spirometry should be considered with caution.

introduction women in hiv prevention trials often must typically agree to avoid pregnancy. regardless, some become pregnant. screening tools predicting pregnancy risk could maximize trial safety and efficiency. objectives we assessed incidence and correlates of pregnancy among women at high hiv risk. methods we enrolled sexually-active, hiv-negative women into an observational cohort (2008–2011). at enrolment demographic, contraceptive, reproductive, pregnancy intention and behavioural data were collected. women reported if one or both partners wanted or intended for the couple to become pregnant. we measured gender role beliefs using a locally validated eight-point index. we tested hiv and pregnancy, and inquired about sexually transmitted infection symptoms (stis) at enrollment and monthly. hiv testing included behavioural counselling and condom provision, but did not specifically counsel women to avoid pregnancy. cox proportional hazard modelling evaluated the associations with pregnancy. the multivariate model included the following variables “recent pregnancy attempts”, “gender roles beliefs”, ”self-reported stis” and “age”. results we screened 1068 women and excluded (24.6%, 263/1068) who did not report risk behaviour. non-pregnant, non-sterilized women aged 18–35 (median = 21 years) enrolled (n = 438). most women reported one partner (74.7%) and a prior live birth (84.6%). median follow-up time was 6 months (range 0.7–15.5). pregnancy incidence was 25.1 per 100 women-years (n = 57 pregnancies). conservative beliefs on gender roles (adjusted hazard ratio (ahr) 1.8; 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.1–2.9), recent pregnancy attempts (ahr 1.9; 95% ci 1.1–3.4) and baseline self-reported sti (ahr 2.5; 95% ci 1.4–4.4) were associated with increased incident pregnancy. report of no pregnancy intention was associated with lowered pregnancy risk (ahr 0.3; 95% ci 0.1–0.7). conclusions we identified new and confirmed existing factors that can facilitate screening for pregnancy risk. background hiv prevalence and incidence among sexually active women in peri-urban areas of ladysmith, edendale, and pinetown, kwazulu-natal, south africa, were assessed between october 2007 and february 2010 in preparation for vaginal microbicide trials. methodology/principal findings sexually active women 18–35 years, not known to be hiv-positive or pregnant were tested cross-sectionally to determine hiv and pregnancy prevalence (798 in ladysmith, 1,084 in edendale, and 891 in pinetown). out of these, approximately 300 confirmed non-pregnant, hiv-negative women were subsequently enrolled at each clinical research center (crc) in a 12-month cohort study with quarterly study visits. women in the cohort studies were required to use a condom plus a hormonal contraceptive method. hiv prevalence rates in the baseline cross-sectional surveys were high: 42% in ladysmith, 46% in edendale and 41% in pinetown. around 90% of study participants at each crc reported one sex partner in the last 3 months, but only 14–30% stated that they were sure that none of their sex partners were hiv-positive. hiv incidence rates based on seroconversions over 12 months were 14.8/100 person-years (py) (95% ci 9.7, 19.8) in ladysmith, 6.3/100 py (95% ci 3.2, 9.4) in edendale, and 7.2/100 py (95% ci 3.7, 10.7) in pinetown. the 12-month pregnancy incidence rates (in the context of high reported contraceptive use) were: 5.7/100 py (95% ci 2.6, 8.7) in ladysmith, 3.1/100 py (95% ci 0.9, 5.2) in edendale and 6.3/100 py (95% ci 3.0, 9.6) in pinetown. conclusions/significance hiv prevalence and incidence remain high in peri-urban areas of kwazulu-natal.
gambling has typically been considered a predominately male activity. however, recent prevalence surveys have shown greater numbers of females are now gambling. much of the gambling literature suggests online gamblers are more likely to be male, and that problem gamblers are more likely to be male. males and females are also likely to be gambling for different reasons and have a preference for different gambling activities. little is known about the pattern of play among female online gamblers. the aim of this survey was to develop a better profile of female online gamblers and to examine any gender differences between males and females in terms of how and why they gamble online, their frequency of online gambling, patterns of play, as well as attitudes to online gambling. the survey was posted on 32 international online gambling websites and was completed by 975 online gamblers (including 175 female online gamblers). chi-square tests of association were conducted to examine the association between gender and a range of variables. the results showed that females had been gambling online for a shorter duration of time than males, had much shorter online gambling sessions, different motivations for gambling online (i.e., to practice for free, to spend less money and out of boredom), and experienced online gambling differently to males, with increased feelings of guilt and shame for gambling online. this suggests there is still a stigma around gambling particularly evident among females in this study. the findings indicate that clinicians and treatment providers need to be aware of these potential gender differences in online gambling to develop appropriately tailored interventions. research and theory regarding the social facilitation effect generates the expectation that the presence of other gamblers (or co-actors) in a gaming venue is likely to intensify individual gambling behavior and magnify losses. fifty male and 66 female participants (116 total) played a computer-simulated electronic gaming machine with a fixed winning sequence, followed by an indefinite losing sequence. measures of the intensity of gambling behavior included the final payout (a direct measure of losses), average bet-size, number of trials played, and the speed of play. some participants received false feedback from the computer designed to suggest that other gamers in adjacent rooms were playing and sometimes winning at the same game. persons who received both sight and sound information, including winning bells and instant messages regarding the wins of other (fake) players, placed more bets and lost more money compared to the other conditions with less information.
predictive models on breeding habitat preferences of bonelli’s eagle (hieraaetus fasciatus; aves: accipitridae) have been performed at four different spatial scales in castellón province, east of iberian peninsula. the scales considered were: (1) nest site scale (1×1 km2 universal transverse mercator (utm) square containing the nest); (2) near nest environment (3×3 km2 utm square); (3) home range scale (5×5 km2 utm square); and (4) landscape level scale (9×9 km2 utm square containing the above mentioned ones). topographic, disturbance, climatic and land use factors were measured on a geographic information system (gis) at occupied and unoccupied utm squares. logistic regression was performed by means of a stepwise addition procedure. we tested whether inclusion of new subset of variables improved the models by increasing the area under the receiver operator characteristic plot. at nest site scale, only topographic factors were considered as the most parsimonious predictors. probability of species occurrence increases with slope in craggy areas at lower altitudes. at the 3×3 km2 scale, climate and disturbance variables were included. at home range and landscape level scales, models included climate, disturbance, topographic and land use factors. higher temperatures in january, template ones in july, higher rainfall in june, lower altitudes and higher slope in the sample unit increase probability of occurrence of bonelli’s eagle at broadest scales. the species seems to prefer disperse forests, scrubland and agricultural areas. from our results, we consider that there is a hierarchical framework on habitat selection procedure. we suggest that it is necessary to analyse what key factors are affecting bonelli’s eagle nest-site selection at every study area to take steps to ensure appropriate conservation measures. the combination of regression modelling and gis will become a powerful tool for biodiversity and conservation studies, taking into account that application depends on sampling design and the model assumptions of the statistical methods employed. finally, predictive models obtained could be used for the efficient monitoring of this scarce species, to predict range expansions or identify suitable locations for reintroductions, and also to design protected areas and to help on wildlife management. 1. to develop a conservation management plan for a species, knowledge of its distribution and spatial arrangement of preferred habitat is essential. this is a difficult task, especially when the species of concern is in low   abundance. in south-western victoria, australia, populations of the rare rufous bristlebird dasyornis broadbenti are threatened by fragmentation of suitable habitat. in order to improve the conservation status of this species, critical habitat requirements must be identified and a system of corridors must be established to link known populations. a predictive spatial model of rufous bristlebird habitat was developed in order to identify critical areas requiring preservation, such as corridors for dispersal. 2. habitat models generated using generalized linear modelling techniques can assist in delineating the specific habitat requirements of a species. coupled with geographic information system (gis) technology, these models can be extrapolated to produce maps displaying the spatial configuration of suitable habitat. 3. models were generated using logistic regression, with bristlebird presence or absence as the dependent variable and landscape variables, extracted from both gis data layers and multispectral digital imagery, as the predictors. a multimodel inference approach based on akaike’s information criterion was used and the resulting model was applied in a gis to extrapolate predicted likelihood of occurrence across the entire area of concern. the predictive performance of the selected model was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (roc) technique. a hierarchical partitioning protocol was used to identify the predictor variables most likely to influence variation in the dependent variable. probability of species presence was used as an index of habitat suitability. 4. negative associations between rufous bristlebird presence and  increasing elevation, 'distance to cree', 'distance to coast' and sun index were evident, suggesting a preference for areas relatively low in altitude, in close proximity to the coastal fringe and drainage lines, and receiving less direct sunlight. a positive association with increasing habitat complexity also suggested that this species prefers areas containing high vertical density of vegetation. 5. the predictive performance of the selected model was shown to be high (area under the curve 0·97), indicating a good fit of the model to the data. hierarchical partitioning analysis showed that all the variables considered had significant  independent contributions towards explaining the variation in the dependent variable. the proportion of the total study area that was predicted as suitable habitat for the rufous bristlebird (using probability of occurrence at a ≥0·5 level ) was 16%. 6. synthesis and applications. the spatial model clearly delineated areas predicted as highly suitable rufous bristlebird habitat, with evidence of potential corridors linking coastal and inland populations via gullies. conservation of this species will depend on management actions that protect the critical habitats identified in the model. a multi-scale  approach to the modelling process is recommended whereby a spatially explicit model is first generated using landscape variables extracted from a gis, and a second model at site level is developed using fine-scale habitat variables measured on the ground. where there are constraints on the time and cost involved in measuring finer scale variables, the first step alone can be used for conservation planning.
since the discovery of the giant mimivirus, evolutionarily related viruses have been isolated or identified from various environments. phylogenetic analyses of this group of viruses, tentatively referred to as the family “megaviridae”, suggest that it has an ancient origin that may predate the emergence of major eukaryotic lineages. environmental genomics has since revealed that megaviridae represents one of the most abundant and diverse groups of viruses in the ocean. in the present study, we compared the taxon richness and phylogenetic diversity of megaviridae, bacteria, and archaea using dna-dependent rna polymerase as a common marker gene. by leveraging existing microbial metagenomic data, we found higher richness and phylogenetic diversity in this single viral family than in the two prokaryotic domains. we also obtained results showing that the evolutionary rate alone cannot account for the observed high diversity of megaviridae lineages. these results suggest that the megaviridae family has a deep co-evolutionary history with diverse marine protists since the early “big-bang” radiation of the eukaryotic tree of life. nucleo-cytoplasmic large dna viruses (ncldvs) constitute a group of eukaryotic viruses that can have crucial ecological roles in the sea by accelerating the turnover of their unicellular hosts or by causing diseases in animals. to better characterize the diversity, abundance and biogeography of marine ncldvs, we analyzed 17 metagenomes derived from microbial samples (0.2–1.6 μm size range) collected during the tara oceans expedition. the sample set includes ecosystems under-represented in previous studies, such as the arabian sea oxygen minimum zone (omz) and indian ocean lagoons. by combining computationally derived relative abundance and direct prokaryote cell counts, the abundance of ncldvs was found to be in the order of 104–105 genomes ml−1 for the samples from the photic zone and 102–103 genomes ml−1 for the omz. the megaviridae and phycodnaviridae dominated the ncldv populations in the metagenomes, although most of the reads classified in these families showed large divergence from known viral genomes. our taxon co-occurrence analysis revealed a potential association between viruses of the megaviridae family and eukaryotes related to oomycetes. in support of this predicted association, we identified six cases of lateral gene transfer between megaviridae and oomycetes. our results suggest that marine ncldvs probably outnumber eukaryotic organisms in the photic layer (per given water mass) and that metagenomic sequence analyses promise to shed new light on the biodiversity of marine viruses and their interactions with potential hosts.
17-α-methyltestosterone (mt) is a synthetic hormone used in fish hatcheries to induce male monosex. snails hold promise as possible test models to assess chemicals acting on the endocrine system. biomphalaria glabrata is an aquatic gastropod mollusk (pulmonata, planorbidae) that can be easily maintained in aquaria, predisposing the species for use in ecotoxicological testing. this study evaluated the reproductive effects of mt on b. glabrata by examining histological changes and its reproductive performance. ten snails per group were exposed for 4 weeks to different concentrations of mt (0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 mg/l). the total number of laid eggs, egg mass per group, size of type v oocytes, and production of spermatozoids were determined. reproduction of b. glabrata was affected by mt. at the lowest concentration (0.01 mg/l), mt caused a statistically significant increase in the number of egg mass per snail compared with controls unexposed to mt. histopathology analyses showed an increase in the sperm production at the higher mt concentrations of 0.1 and 1.0 mg/l. chromatographic analyses of water samples showed that mt concentrations rapidly declined within a 96-h period. these results highlight the importance of giving more support to regulatory authorities, since mt is not registered for use on fish hatcheries in many countries around the world. wastewater from fish farms discharged into aquatic ecosystems should be monitored for mt residues, since its presence could compromise the reproduction of other native snail species. summary australorbis glabratus adults were placed in either 0.05 or 0.1 ppm of sodium pentachlorophenate for 7 or 8 days and the effects of this treatment on egg production and on viability of the eggs laid were determined. in general the treatment drastically reduced egg production and a very large proportion of all eggs recovered from the aquaria were dead. removal of the chemical resulted in improved egg production and egg viability. the possible significance of these results for field control of the snail vectors of schistosomiasis is discussed.
teaching the computer to understand language is the major goal in the field of natural language processing. in this thesis we introduce computational methods that aim to extract language structure — e.g. grammar, semantics or syntax — from text, which provides the computer with information in order to understand language. during the last decades, scientific efforts and the increase of computational resources made it possible to come closer to the goal of understanding language. in order to extract language structure, many approaches train the computer on manually created resources. most of these so-called supervised methods show high performance when applied to similar textual data. however, they perform inferior when operating on textual data, which are different to the one they are trained on. whereas training the computer is essential to obtain reasonable structure from natural language, we want to avoid training the computer using manually created resources.    in this thesis, we present so-called unsupervised methods, which are suited to learn patterns in order to extract structure from textual data directly. these patterns are learned with methods that extract the semantics (meanings) of words and phrases. in comparison to manually built knowledge bases, unsupervised methods are more flexible: they can extract structure from text of different languages or text domains (e.g. finance or medical texts), without requiring manually annotated structure. however, learning structure from text often faces sparsity issues. the reason for these phenomena is that in language many words occur only few times. if a word is seen only few times no precise information can be extracted from the text it occurs. whereas sparsity issues cannot be solved completely, information about most words can be gained by using large amounts of data.    in the first chapter, we briefly describe how computers can learn to understand language. afterwards, we present the main contributions, list the publications this thesis is based on and give an overview of this thesis.    chapter 2 introduces the terminology used in this thesis and gives a background about natural language processing. then, we characterize the linguistic theory on how humans understand language. afterwards, we show how the underlying linguistic intuition can be  operationalized for computers. based on this operationalization, we introduce a formalism for representing words and their context. this formalism is used in the following chapters in order to compute similarities between words.    in chapter 3 we give a brief description of methods in the field of computational semantics, which are targeted to compute similarities between words. all these methods have in common that they extract a contextual representation for a word that is generated from text. then, this representation is used to compute similarities between words. in addition, we also present examples of the word similarities that are computed with these methods.    segmenting text into its topically related units is intuitively performed by humans and helps to extract connections between words in text. we equip the computer with these abilities by introducing a text segmentation algorithm in chapter 4. this algorithm is based on a statistical topic model, which learns to cluster words into topics solely on the basis of the text. using the segmentation algorithm, we demonstrate the influence of the parameters provided by the topic model. in addition, our method yields state-of-the-art performances on two datasets.    in order to represent the meaning of words, we use context information (e.g. neighboring words), which is utilized to compute similarities. whereas we described methods for word similarity computations in chapter 3, we introduce a generic symbolic framework in chapter 5. as we follow a symbolic approach, we do not represent words using dense numeric vectors but we use symbols (e.g. neighboring words or syntactic dependency parses) directly. such a representation is readable for humans and is preferred in sensitive applications like the medical domain, where the reason for decisions needs to be provided. this framework enables the processing of arbitrarily large data. furthermore, it is able to compute the most similar words for all words within a text collection resulting in a distributional thesaurus. we show the influence of various parameters deployed in our framework and examine the impact of different corpora used for computing similarities. performing computations based on various contextual representations, we obtain the best results when using syntactic dependencies between words within sentences. however, these syntactic dependencies are predicted using a supervised dependency parser, which is trained on language-dependent and human-annotated resources.    to avoid such language-specific preprocessing for computing distributional thesauri, we investigate the replacement of language-dependent dependency parsers by language-independent unsupervised parsers in chapter 6. evaluating the syntactic dependencies from unsupervised and supervised parses against human-annotated resources reveals that the unsupervised methods are not capable to compete with the supervised ones. in this chapter we use the predicted structure of both types of parses as context representation in order to compute word similarities. then, we evaluate the quality of the similarities, which provides an extrinsic evaluation setup for both unsupervised and supervised dependency parsers. in an evaluation on english text, similarities computed based on contextual representations generated with unsupervised parsers do not outperform the similarities computed with the context representation extracted from supervised parsers. however, we observe the best results when applying context retrieved by the unsupervised parser for computing distributional thesauri on german language. furthermore, we demonstrate that our framework is capable to combine different context representations, as we obtain the best performance with a combination of both flavors of syntactic dependencies for both languages.    most languages are not composed of single-worded terms only, but also contain many multi-worded terms that form a unit, called multiword expressions. the identification of multiword expressions is particularly important for semantics, as e.g. the term new york has a different meaning than its single terms new or york. whereas most research on semantics avoids handling these expressions, we target on the extraction of multiword expressions in chapter 7. most previously introduced methods rely on part-of-speech tags and apply a ranking function to rank term sequences according to their multiwordness. here, we introduce a language-independent and knowledge-free ranking method that uses information from distributional thesauri. performing evaluations on english and french textual data, our method achieves the best results in comparison to methods from the literature.    in chapter 8 we apply information from distributional thesauri as features for various applications. first, we introduce a general setting for tackling the out-of-vocabulary problem. this problem describes the inferior performance of supervised methods according to words that are not contained in the training data. we alleviate this issue by replacing these unseen words with the most similar ones that are known, extracted from a distributional thesaurus. using a supervised part-of-speech tagging method, we show substantial improvements in the classification performance for out-of-vocabulary words based on german and english textual data. the second application introduces a system for replacing words within a sentence with a word of the same meaning. for this application, the information from a distributional thesaurus provides the highest-scoring features. in the last application, we introduce an algorithm that is capable to detect the different meanings of a word and groups them into coarse-grained categories, called supersenses. generating features by means of supersenses and distributional thesauri yields an performance increase when plugged into a supervised system that recognized named entities (e.g. names, organizations or locations).    further directions for using distributional thesauri are presented in chapter 9. first, we lay out a method, which is capable of incorporating background information (e.g. source of the text collection or sense information) into a distributional thesaurus. furthermore, we describe an approach on building thesauri for different text domains (e.g. medical or finance domain) and how they can be combined to have a high coverage of domain-specific knowledge as well as a broad background for the open domain. in the last section we characterize yet another method, suited to enrich existing knowledge bases. all three directions might be further extensions, which induce further structure based on textual data.    the last chapter gives a summary of this work: we demonstrate that without language-dependent knowledge, a computer can learn to extract useful structure from text by using computational semantics. due to the unsupervised nature of the introduced methods, we are able to extract new structure from raw textual data. this is important especially for languages, for which less manually created resources are available as well as for special domains e.g. medical or finance. we have demonstrated that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance. furthermore, we have proven their impact by applying the extracted structure in three natural language processing tasks. we have also applied the methods to different languages and large amounts of data. thus, we have not proposed methods, which are suited for extracting structure for a single language, but methods that are capable to explore structure for “language” in general. work on part-of-speech tagging has concentrated on english in the past, since a lot of manually tagged training material is available for english and results can be compared to those of other researchers. it was assumed that methods which have been developed for english would work for other languages as well.1
backgroundplant polyphenol oxidases (ppos) are enzymes that typically use molecular oxygen to oxidize ortho-diphenols to ortho-quinones. these commonly cause browning reactions following tissue damage, and may be important in plant defense. some ppos function as hydroxylases or in cross-linking reactions, but in most plants their physiological roles are not known. to better understand the importance of ppos in the plant kingdom, we surveyed ppo gene families in 25 sequenced genomes from chlorophytes, bryophytes, lycophytes, and flowering plants. the ppo genes were then analyzed in silico for gene structure, phylogenetic relationships, and targeting signals.resultsmany previously uncharacterized ppo genes were uncovered. the moss, physcomitrella patens, contained 13 ppo genes and selaginella moellendorffii (spike moss) and glycine max (soybean) each had 11 genes. populus trichocarpa (poplar) contained a highly diversified gene family with 11 ppo genes, but several flowering plants had only a single ppo gene. by contrast, no ppo- like sequences were identified in several chlorophyte (green algae) genomes or arabidopsis (a. lyrata and a. thaliana). we found that many ppos contained one or two introns often near the 3’ terminus. furthermore, n-terminal amino acid sequence analysis using chlorop and targetp 1.1 predicted that several putative ppos are synthesized via the secretory pathway, a unique finding as most ppos are predicted to be chloroplast proteins. phylogenetic reconstruction of these sequences revealed that large ppo gene repertoires in some species are mostly a consequence of independent bursts of gene duplication, while the lineage leading to arabidopsis must have lost all ppo genes.conclusionour survey identified ppos in gene families of varying sizes in all land plants except in the genus arabidopsis. while we found variation in intron numbers and positions, overall ppo gene structure is congruent with the phylogenetic relationships based on primary sequence data. the dynamic nature of this gene family differentiates ppo from other oxidative enzymes, and is consistent with a protein important for a diversity of functions relating to environmental adaptation. we describe muscle, a new computer program for creating multiple alignments of protein sequences. elements of the algorithm include fast distance estimation using kmer counting, progressive alignment using a new profile function we call the log-expectation score, and refinement using tree-dependent restricted partitioning. the speed and accuracy of muscle are compared with t-coffee, mafft and clustalw on four test sets of reference alignments: balibase, sabmark, smart and a new benchmark, prefab. muscle achieves the highest, or joint highest, rank in accuracy on each of these sets. without refinement, muscle achieves average accuracy statistically indistinguishable from t-coffee and mafft, and is the fastest of the tested methods for large numbers of sequences, aligning 5000 sequences of average length 350 in 7 min on a current desktop computer. the muscle program, source code and prefab test data are freely available at http://www.drive5. com/muscle.

the aim of this study was to explore how very old people consider and arrive at decisions on relocation, with specific attention to housing and health relationships during the process of ageing. the sample included 13 very old participants of an 11-year longitudinal study of relationships between housing and health. applying a mixed-methods approach, data from qualitative interviews and quantitative survey data from three data collection waves were utilised. the quantitative data were interwoven with the qualitative findings into a coherent body of text. the core theme “negotiating and effectuating relocation is a long process” indicates a non-linear process consisting of five phases constituting the main categories of our findings. in the first phase, some informants considered relocation while others avoided thinking about it. next, relations between health and home changed and led to turning points triggering relocation, i.e. when dependence in everyday activities reached critical points or when sudden illness forced an involuntary move. in the third phase, once the decision to relocate was made it was set in stone by the individual, but often questioned by the authorities, leading to a situation causing much frustration. while waiting for the relocation, doubts as well as expectations about the new home were expressed. finally, even though the actual move caused different feelings, it was most often a positive experience and resulted in subjective health improvement and increased social contacts. the results can be used for the development of positive, proactive strategies for improved housing provision along the ageing process. background and aims: in order to investigate the relation between personal functional capacity and the physical housing environment during the aging process, the aim of this study was to give a long-term description of person-environmental fit (p-e fit) problems in terms of housing accessibility and adl dependence among older adults, and to study their relationships at three points in time. methods: a 10-year longitudinal design was used: baseline (1994), follow-up 1 (2000) and follow-up 2 (2004). using the swedish national population register, a baseline sample of persons aged 75–84 years was identified. of the 133 participants at baseline, the 31 participants still available at follow-up 2 were included in this study. data on housing accessibility, functional limitations and dependence in adl were collected by means of interviews and observations at home visits. results: p-e fit problems increased significantly between baseline and follow-up 1 and between follow-ups 1 and 2. no significant changes in overall adl dependence were recorded. the total number of functional limitations, dependence on walking aids and p-e fit were significantly correlated to adl dependence, at both follow-up 1 and follow-up 2, but not at baseline. conclusions: results confirm that functional decline is a major driver toward increased adl dependence during the aging process, whereas environmental barriers per se are not related to such disability. instead, p-e fit is significantly related to adl dependence, and the relationship grows stronger with advancing age.
amino acid substitutions in protein structures often require subtle backbone adjustments that are difficult to model in atomic detail. an improved ability to predict realistic backbone changes in response to engineered mutations would be of great utility for the blossoming field of rational protein design. one model that has recently grown in acceptance is the backrub motion, a low-energy dipeptide rotation with single-peptide counter-rotations, that is coupled to dynamic two-state sidechain rotamer jumps, as evidenced by alternate conformations in very high-resolution crystal structures. it has been speculated that backrubs may facilitate sequence changes equally well as rotamer changes. however, backrub-induced shifts and experimental uncertainty are of similar magnitude for backbone atoms in even high-resolution structures, so comparison of wildtype-vs.-mutant crystal structure pairs is not sufficient to directly link backrubs to mutations. in this study, we use two alternative approaches that bypass this limitation. first, we use a quality-filtered structure database to aggregate many examples for precisely defined motifs with single amino acid differences, and find that the effectively amplified backbone differences closely resemble backrubs. second, we directly apply a provably-accurate, backrub-enabled protein design algorithm to idealized versions of these motifs, and discover that the lowest-energy computed models match the average-coordinate experimental structures. these results support the hypothesis that backrubs participate in natural protein evolution and validate their continued use for design of synthetic proteins. geometrical validation around the cα is described, with a new cβ measure and updated ramachandran plot. deviation of the observed cβ atom from ideal position provides a single measure encapsulating the major structure‐validation information contained in bond angle distortions. cβ deviation is sensitive to incompatibilities between sidechain and backbone caused by misfit conformations or inappropriate refinement restraints. a new ϕ,ψ plot using density‐dependent smoothing for 81,234 non‐gly, non‐pro, and non‐prepro residues with b < 30 from 500 high‐resolution proteins shows sharp boundaries at critical edges and clear delineation between large empty areas and regions that are allowed but disfavored. one such region is the γ‐turn conformation near +75°,−60°, counted as forbidden by common structure‐validation programs; however, it occurs in well‐ordered parts of good structures, it is overrepresented near functional sites, and strain is partly compensated by the γ‐turn h‐bond. favored and allowed ϕ,ψ regions are also defined for pro, pre‐pro, and gly (important because gly ϕ,ψ angles are more permissive but less accurately determined). details of these accurate empirical distributions are poorly predicted by previous theoretical calculations, including a region left of α‐helix, which rates as favorable in energy yet rarely occurs. a proposed factor explaining this discrepancy is that crowding of the two‐peptide nhs permits donating only a single h‐bond. new calculations by hu et al. [proteins 2002 (this issue)] for ala and gly dipeptides, using mixed quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics, fit our nonrepetitive data in excellent detail. to run our geometrical evaluations on a user‐uploaded file, see molprobity (http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu) or rampage (http://www‐cryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk/rampage). proteins 2003;50:437–450. © 2003 wiley‐liss, inc.
optimized mannoside compounds that block uropathogenic e. coli entry into bladder epithelium were effective in the treatment and prevention of urinary tract infections in mice. bypassing resistance to treatment of urinary tract infections sometimes, we can have too much of a good thing. the antibiotics that allow us to survive microbial infections and save untold human lives brought with them the emergence of microbes resistant to these drugs. these resistant pathogens often make trouble in the urinary system, causing recurrent urinary tract infections (utis) in women that require long-term antibiotic use and resist treatment. to thwart the evolution of the drug-resistant escherichia coli that favor the urinary tract, cusumano et al. have developed a series of mannoside compounds as alternative antimicrobial drugs. because these agents interfere with the ability of uropathogenic e. coli to bind to bladder epithelial cells through a receptor called fimh, they interrupt the e. coli life cycle, curing infection. optimization of other features, including oral availability, yields a promising contender for translation into patients. from a panel of mannoside compounds, the authors selected one (termed 6) that inhibited e. coli biofilm production in culture at a relatively low dose and survived passage through the gut, allowing administration in pill form. when they gave it to mice with chronic utis, 6 quickly cause a drop in the bacteria in the bladder to a level considerably lower than that produced by the standard antibiotic treatment. and when mice received 6 before exposure to bacteria, they remained healthy, likely because the drug blocked bacterial entry into bladder cells. compound 6’s ability to keep bacteria out of the epithelial cells of the bladder could also augment the action of the standard antibiotic by ensuring that the microbes stayed in the bladder lumen where they were exposed to maximal doses of antibiotics. in another round of chemical tweaking, the authors further improved compound 6 to increase its binding to fimh, cell permeability, oral bioavailability, and bladder tissue penetration. the result—compound 8—is an excellent lead candidate for the treatment and prevention of recurrent uti. safety and efficacy studies in women will test 8’s promise in bypassing the antibiotic resistance that complicates the management of this common infection. chronic and recurrent urinary tract infections pose a serious medical problem because there are few effective treatment options. patients with chronic urinary tract infections are commonly treated with long-term prophylactic antibiotics that promote the development of antibiotic-resistant forms of uropathogenic escherichia coli (upec), further complicating treatment. we developed small–molecular weight compounds termed mannosides that specifically inhibit the fimh type 1 pilus lectin of upec, which mediates bacterial colonization, invasion, and formation of recalcitrant intracellular bacterial communities in the bladder epithelium. here, we optimized these compounds for oral bioavailability and demonstrated their fast-acting efficacy in treating chronic urinary tract infections in a preclinical murine model. these compounds also prevented infection in vivo when given prophylactically and strongly potentiated the activity of the current standard of care therapy, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, against clinically resistant pbc-1 upec bacteria. these compounds have therapeutic efficacy after oral administration for the treatment of established urinary tract infections in vivo. their unique mechanism of action—targeting the pilus tip adhesin fimh—circumvents the conventional requirement for drug penetration of the outer membrane, minimizing the potential for the development of resistance. the small–molecular weight compounds described herein promise to provide substantial benefit to women suffering from chronic and recurrent urinary tract infections. fimbriae are proteinogeneous appendages on the surface of bacteria, which mediate bacterial adhesion to the host cell glycocalyx. the so-called type 1 fimbriae exhibit specificity for alpha-d-mannosides and, therefore, they are assumed to mediate bacterial adhesion via the interaction of a fimbrial lectin and alpha-d-mannosyl residues exposed on the host cell surface. this carbohydrate-specific adhesive protein subunit of type 1 fimbriae has been identified as a protein called fimh. the crystal structure of this lectin is known and, based on this information, the molecular details of the interaction of mannoside ligands and fimh are addressed in this paper. computer-based docking methods were used to evaluate known ligands as well as to design new ones. then, a series of new mannosides with extended aglycon was synthesized and tested as inhibitors of type 1 fimbriae-mediated bacterial adhesion in an elisa. the results obtained were compared to the predictions and findings as delivered by molecular modeling. this study led to an improved understanding of the ligand-receptor interactions under investigation.
the gene slr0388 was previously annotated to encode a hypothetical protein in synechocystis sp. strain pcc 6803. when a positively phototactic strain of this cyanobacterium was insertionally inactivated at slr0388, the mutants were not transformable, and appeared to aggregate as a result of increased bundling of type iv pili. also, these mutants were rendered non-phototactic compared to the wild-type. quantitative real-time pcr revealed a 3.5-fold increase in pila1 transcript levels in the mutant over wild-type cells, while there were no changes in the level of pilt1 and coma transcripts. supernatant from mutant liquid culture contained more pila1 protein, confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis, compared to the wild-type cells, which corresponded to the increase in pila1 transcripts. the increase in pila1 subunits may contribute to the bundling morphology of pili that was observed, which in turn may act to retard dna uptake by hindering the retraction of pili. this gene is therefore proposed to be designated comf, as it possesses a phosphoribosyltransferase domain, a distinguishing feature of other comf proteins of naturally transformable heterotrophic bacteria. this report is the second of a competence-related gene from synechocystis sp. strain pcc 6803, the product of which does not show homology to other well-studied type iv pili proteins. proteins from silver-stained gels can be digested enzymatically and the resulting peptide analyzed and sequenced by mass spectrometry. standard proteins yield the same peptide maps when extracted from coomassie- and silver-stained gels, as judged by electrospray and maldi mass spectrometry. the low nanogram range can be reached by the protocols described here, and the method is robust. a silver-stained one-dimensional gel of a fraction from yeast proteins was analyzed by nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. in the sequencing, more than 1000 amino acids were covered, resulting in no evidence of chemical modifications due to the silver staining procedure. silver staining allows a substantial shortening of sample preparation time and may, therefore, be preferable over coomassie staining. this work removes a major obstacle to the low-level sequence analysis of proteins separated on polyacrylamide gels.
the mechanisms regulating the permeability of lens epithelial cell gap junctions in response to calcium ionophore or atp agonist-mediated increases in cytosolic ca2+ (cai2+) have been investigated using inhibitors of calmodulin (cam) and pkc. cell-to-cell transfer of the fluorescent dye alexafluor594 decreased after the rapid and sustained increase in cai2+ (to micromolar concentrations) observed after the addition of ionophore plus ca2+ but was prevented by pretreatment with inhibitors of cam but not pkc. in contrast, the delayed, transient decrease in cell-to-cell coupling observed after the addition of atp that we have reported previously (churchill g, lurtz mm, and louis cf. am j physiol cell physiol 281: c972-c981, 2001) could be prevented by either the direct or indirect inhibition of pkc but not by inhibition of cam. surprisingly, there was no change in the relative proportion of the different phosphorylated forms of lens connexin43 after this atp-dependent transient decrease in cell-to-cell coupling. although bapta-loaded cells did not display the atp-dependent transient increase in cai2+, the delayed, transient decrease in cell-to-cell dye transfer was still observed, indicating it was cai2+ independent. thus cam-mediated inhibition of lens gap junctions is associated with sustained, micromolar cai2+ concentrations, whereas pkc-mediated inhibition of lens gap junctions is associated with agonist activation of second messenger pathways that are independent of changes in cai2+. churchill, grant c., monica m. lurtz, and charles f. louis. ca21 regulation of gap junctional coupling in lens epithelial cells. am j physiol cell physiol 281: c972–c981, 2001.—the quantitative effects of ca21 signaling on gap junctional coupling in lens epithelial cells have been determined using either the spread of mn21 that is imaged by its ability to quench the fluorescence of fura 2 or the spread of the fluorescent dye alexa fluor 594. gap junctional coupling was unaffected by a mechanically stimulated cell-to-cell ca21 wave. furthermore, when cytosolic ca21 concentration (cai ) increased after the addition of the agonist atp, coupling was unaffected during the period that cai 21 was maximal. however, coupling decreased transiently ;5–10 min after agonist addition when cai 21 returned to resting levels, indicating that this transient decrease in coupling was unlikely due to a direct action of cai 21 on gap junctions. an increase in cai 21 mediated by the ionophore ionomycin that was sustained for several minutes resulted in a more rapid and sustained decrease in coupling (ic50 ;300 nm ca21, hill coefficient of 4), indicating that an increase in cai 21 alone could regulate gap junctions. thus cai 21 increases that occurred during agonist stimulation and cell-to-cell ca21 waves were too transient to mediate a sustained uncoupling of lens epithelial cells.
backgroundrna-protein interactions (rpis) play important roles in a wide variety of cellular processes, ranging from transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression to host defense against pathogens. high throughput experiments to identify rna-protein interactions are beginning to provide valuable information about the complexity of rna-protein interaction networks, but are expensive and time consuming. hence, there is a need for reliable computational methods for predicting rna-protein interactions.resultswe propose rpiseq, a family of classifiers for predicting r na-p rotein i nteractions using only seq uence information. given the sequences of an rna and a protein as input, rpiseq predicts whether or not the rna-protein pair interact. the rna sequence is encoded as a normalized vector of its ribonucleotide 4-mer composition, and the protein sequence is encoded as a normalized vector of its 3-mer composition, based on a 7-letter reduced alphabet representation. two variants of rpiseq are presented: rpiseq-svm, which uses a support vector machine (svm) classifier and rpiseq-rf, which uses a random forest classifier. on two non-redundant benchmark datasets extracted from the protein-rna interface database (pridb), rpiseq achieved an auc (area under the receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve) of 0.96 and 0.92. on a third dataset containing only mrna-protein interactions, the performance of rpiseq was competitive with that of a published method that requires information regarding many different features (e.g., mrna half-life, go annotations) of the putative rna and protein partners. in addition, rpiseq classifiers trained using the pridb data correctly predicted the majority (57-99%) of non-coding rna-protein interactions in npinter-derived networks from e. coli, s. cerevisiae, d. melanogaster, m. musculus, and h. sapiens.conclusionsour experiments with rpiseq demonstrate that rna-protein interactions can be reliably predicted using only sequence-derived information. rpiseq offers an inexpensive method for computational construction of rna-protein interaction networks, and should provide useful insights into the function of non-coding rnas. rpiseq is freely available as a web-based server at http://pridb.gdcb.iastate.edu/rpiseq/. the protein–rna interface database (pridb) is a comprehensive database of protein–rna interfaces extracted from complexes in the protein data bank (pdb). it is designed to facilitate detailed analyses of individual protein–rna complexes and their interfaces, in addition to automated generation of user-defined data sets of protein–rna interfaces for statistical analyses and machine learning applications. for any chosen pdb complex or list of complexes, pridb rapidly displays interfacial amino acids and ribonucleotides within the primary sequences of the interacting protein and rna chains. pridb also identifies prosite motifs in protein chains and fr3d motifs in rna chains and provides links to these external databases, as well as to structure files in the pdb. an integrated jmol applet is provided for visualization of interacting atoms and residues in the context of the 3d complex structures. the current version of pridb contains structural information regarding 926 protein–rna complexes available in the pdb (as of 10 october 2010). atomic- and residue-level contact information for the entire data set can be downloaded in a simple machine-readable format. also, several non-redundant benchmark data sets of protein–rna complexes are provided. the pridb database is freely available online at http://bindr.gdcb.iastate.edu/pridb.
conventional multiphase image segmentation methods perform well in segmenting piecewise constant or local piecewise constant images. however, real images usually contain intensity variation induced by illumination inhomogeneity, small scale details, texture and noise. this brings great challenges to image segmentation and heavily degenerates the performance of the conventional methods. in this work, we proposed a new fuzzy segmentation model which unified image segmentation and cartoon-texture decomposition. we also presented an iteration algorithm for solving the proposed model. in the model, the decomposition and the segmentation tasks executed alternatively and affected each other. the cartoon component resulted from the decomposition is a piecewise smooth approximation of the original image and it only contains the main structure and large scale edges of the original image. segmentation is essentially performed on the cartoon part, thus it can avoid the influence of intensity variation caused by small scale details, texture and noise. extensive experiments confirmed that the proposed method can effectively overcome the drawback of conventional methods and performed much better than conventional methods in segmenting images with strong intensity variation caused by small scale details, texture and noise. we present a new variational model for the soft multiphase image segmentation. in the model, we introduce a nonconvex regularizer on the membership functions which are used as indicators of different homogeneous regions. the nonconvex regularizer performs better than the usual convex ones in that (i) it well preserves geometric shapes of the homogeneous regions, and (ii) it protects edges from oversmoothing which is a common drawback of the convex regularizer. to solve the nonconvex minimization problem, we design a new fast alternative iteration algorithm, which is robust to the setting of the parameters in the model. we conduct comprehensive experiments to measure the performance of the algorithm in terms of visual evaluation and a variety of quantitative indices for image segmentation. the algorithm achieves more accurate results compared to other well-known convex variational methods for image segmentation.
background: it has been reported that clinical results of mechanical periodontal treatment could differ between subjects and among different sites of the tooth in the patient. the objective of this multilevel analysis is to investigate clinical factors at subject and sites of the tooth that influence variations in clinical attachment (cal) increase and probing depth (pd) diminution of adjunctive moxifloxacin (mox) at six months post-treatment in generalized aggressive periodontitis. methods: this clinical trial included 40 patients randomly distributed to two therapy protocols: scaling and root planing alone or combined with mox. multilevel linear models for continuous variables were formulated to evaluate the clinical impact of the hierarchical configuration of periodontal data. results: six months following therapy, the divergences between both protocols were statistically significant in pd diminution and cal increase, favouring the mox therapy (p<0.001). besides, the multilevel analysis revealed that adjunctive mox at the subject level, non-molar and the interaction non-molar x mox at the tooth level, interproximal sites and the interaction interproximal sites x mox at the site level, were statistically significant factors in determining cal increase and pd diminution. conclusions: the main cause of variability in cal gain and pd reduction following adjunctive mox was attributable to the tooth level. adjunctive mox and their interactions with non-molar and interproximal sites showed higher clinical benefits at the tooth and site levels which could be essential for pd reduction and cal gain in generalized aggressive periodontitis subjects. aim the aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological efficacy of moxifloxacin (mox) in one-stage scaling and root planing (srp) in treating generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp).   materials and methods forty subjects were randomly allocated to two treatment groups. the two treatment groups consisted of srp combined with systemically administered mox at the dosage of 400 mg once daily for 7 days or srp + placebo once daily for 7 days. subgingival plaque samples were analysed for cultivable bacteria.   results both groups resulted in significant reduction of probing depth (pd) and clinical attachment level (cal) compared with baseline (p < 0.0001), and this difference was maintained at 6 months from baseline in both groups. however, subjects receiving mox showed the greatest improvements cal, and pd. subjects in both groups at 6 months displayed the greatest reduction from baseline in frequency of sites with pd ≥ 6 mm (p < 0.001), favouring the mox group. adjunctive antibiotic protocol reduced subgingival aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans to undetectable levels, after 3 and 6 months, and there was a significant reduction in the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia in the mox group compared to the placebo group.   conclusions the results from this study suggest that moxifloxacin as and adjunct to one-stage full-mouth srp leads to a better clinical and microbiological advantages compared to mechanical treatment.
in the past ten years we followed the expansion of cardiology imaging technology and how it relates to integration, tele-consulting and standards. the new frontier of picture archiving and communication systems (pacs) is expanding and require more technology and resources. cardiology imaging is evolving and needs even more resources than before. the present work proposes a new approach to manage a large cardiology pacs installation using new open-source facilities on affordable hardware creating a reliable system. for this kind of application we moved our core system from linux platform to the new opensolaris unix and to novelty functions like solaris containers, zfs file-system and fair share scheduler, in order to achieve server consolidation, ease of use and reliability. the first interoperability demonstration of the cardiology profiles of the "integrating the healthcare enterprise" (ihe) initiative was held in conjunction with the annual scientific sessions of the american college of cardiology (acc) in march, 2005. the ihe cardiology planning committee identified clinical problems to be addressed: the ability to view an ecg from anywhere in the enterprise, and the effective integration of patient, order and procedure information for echocardiography and for cardiac catheterization. the ihe cardiology technical committee developed a set of integration profiles to address the retrieval and display of ecg's as well as scheduled and unscheduled echo and cath for registered and unregistered patients. the demonstration used clinical scenarios to demonstrate the integration of the participating systems: (1) emergent angioplasty (2) change of procedure room; (3) add-on mobile echo procedure; and (4) stress echo images
query suggestions have become pervasive in modern web search, as a mechanism to guide users towards a better representation of their information need. in this article, we propose a ranking approach for producing effective query suggestions. in particular, we devise a structured representation of candidate suggestions mined from a query log that leverages evidence from other queries with a common session or a common click. this enriched representation not only helps overcome data sparsity for long-tail queries, but also leads to multiple ranking criteria, which we integrate as features for learning to rank query suggestions. to validate our approach, we build upon existing efforts for web search evaluation and propose a novel framework for the quantitative assessment of query suggestion effectiveness. thorough experiments using publicly available data from the trec web track show that our approach provides effective suggestions for adhoc and diversity search. the trec web track explores and evaluates web retrieval technology over large collections of web data. in its current incarnation, the web track has been active since trec 2009, where it included both a traditional adhoc retrieval task and a new diversity task [4]. the goal of this diversity task is to return a ranked list of pages that together provide complete coverage for a query, while avoiding excessive redundancy in the result list. for trec 2010 the track introduced a new web spam task and web-style, six-level relevance assessment for the adhoc task [5]. for trec 2011, as recommended by participants at the track planning session held during trec 2010, we dropped the spam task but continued the other tasks essentially unchanged. as we did for trec 2009 and trec 2010, we based our trec 2011 experiments on the billion-page clueweb09 collection created by the language technologies institute at carnegie mellon university. the tasks use a common topic set, differing only in their evaluation methodology. topics are created from the logs of a commercial search engine, with the aid of tools developed at microsoft research [9]. given a target query, these tools extract and analyze groups of related queries, using co-clicks and other information, to identify clusters of queries that highlight different aspects and interpretations of the target query. these clusters are employed by nist for topic development. each resulting topic is structured as a representative set of subtopics, each related to a different user need. the selection of subtopics attempts to reflect a mix of genuine user requirements for the topic. for the adhoc task documents are judged with respect to the topic as a whole. relevance levels are similar in structure to the levels used in commercial web search, including a spam/junk level. moreover, the top two levels of the assessment structure are closely related to the homepage finding and topic distillation tasks appearing in older web tracks. for the diversity task, documents are judged with respect to the subtopics, as well as with respect to the topic as a whole. for trec 2011, the topic selection process was modified slightly from previous years. for trec 2009 and 2010, topics were chosen to be of medium-to-high frequency. trec 2011 attempts to work with more obscure topics, which may still be underspecified (i.e., faceted) but may be less ambiguous. search engines have difficulty with queries of this type, since they can rely less on click/anchor information, and popularity signals like pagerank. with these new tough topics we hope to work in an area of web retrieval that has received relatively little attention. given the smaller number of pages that may be relevant for these tough topics, we may potentially be able to create a more reusable collection, with sufficiently complete judgments.
abstractpurposeto explore the associations of severe musculoskeletal injuries (joint and muscles) and surgeries with symptoms of common mental disorders (distress, anxiety/depression, sleeping disturbance, adverse alcohol behaviour , smoking, adverse nutrition behaviour) among male european professional footballers.methodscross-sectional analyses were conducted on electronic questionnaires completed by professional footballers recruited from the national players’ unions of finland, france, norway, spain or sweden. the number of severe (time loss of more than 28 days) musculoskeletal injuries (total, joint, muscle) and surgeries during a professional football career was examined through four questions, while symptoms of common mental disorders were evaluated through validated scales.resultsa total of 540 professional footballers (mean age of 27 years; 54 % playing in the highest leagues) participated in the study. sixty-eight per cent of the participants had already incurred one or more severe joint injuries and 60 % one or more severe muscle injuries. prevalence of symptoms of common mental disorders ranged from 3 % for smoking to 37 % for anxiety/depression and 58 % for adverse nutrition behaviour. the number of severe musculoskeletal injuries during a football career was positively correlated with distress, anxiety and sleeping disturbance, while the number of surgeries was correlated with adverse alcohol behaviour and smoking. professional footballers who had sustained one or more severe musculoskeletal injuries during their career were two to nearly four times more likely to report symptoms of common mental disorders than professional footballers who had not suffered from severe musculoskeletal injuries.conclusionit can be concluded that the number of severe musculoskeletal injuries and surgeries during a career is positively correlated and associated with symptoms of common mental disorders among male european professional footballers. this study emphasises the importance of applying a multidisciplinary approach to the clinical care and support of professional footballers, especially when a player faces lengthy periods without training and competition as a consequence of recurrent severe joint or muscle injuries.level of evidenceiii. this article reports on the development of short forms from the patient-reported outcomes measurement information system (promis™) sleep disturbance (sd) and sleep-related impairment (sri) item banks. results from post-hoc computerized adaptive testing (cat) simulations, item discrimination parameters, item means, and clinical judgments were used to select the best-performing 8 items for sd and sri. the final 8-item short forms provided less test information than the corresponding full banks, but correlated strongly with the longer forms. the short forms had greater measurement precision than the pittsburgh sleep quality index (psqi) and the epworth sleepiness scale (ess), as indicated by larger test information values across the continuum of severity, despite having fewer total items—a major advantage for both research and clinical settings.
duck hepatitis virus type 1 (dhv-1) was previously classified as an enterovirus, based primarily on observed morphology and physicochemical properties of the virion. the complete nucleotide sequences of two strains (drl-62 and r85952) of dhv-1 have been determined. excluding the poly(a) tail, the genomes are 7691 and 7690 nt, respectively, and contain a single, large open reading frame encoding a polyprotein of 2249 aa. the genome of dhv-1 is organized as are those of members of the family picornaviridae: 5' untranslated region (utr)-vp0-vp3-vp1-2a1-2a2-2b-2c-3a-3b-3c-3d-3' utr. analysis of the genomic and predicted polyprotein sequences revealed several unusual features, including the absence of a predicted maturation cleavage of vp0, the presence of two unrelated 2a protein motifs and a 3' utr extended markedly compared with that of any other picornavirus. the 2a1 protein motif is related to the 2a protein type of the genus aphthovirus and the adjacent 2a2 protein is related to the 2a protein type present in the genus parechovirus. phylogenetic analysis using the 3d protein sequence shows that the two dhv-1 strains are related more closely to members of the genus parechovirus than to other picornaviruses. however, the two dhv-1 strains form a monophyletic group, clearly distinct from members of the genus parechovirus. the abbreviated name, 'mfold web server', describes a number of closely related software applications available on the world wide web (www) for the prediction of the secondary structure of single stranded nucleic acids. the objective of this web server is to provide easy access to rna and dna folding and hybridization software to the scientific community at large. by making use of universally available web guis (graphical user interfaces), the server circumvents the problem of portability of this software. detailed output, in the form of structure plots with or without reliability information, single strand frequency plots and 'energy dot plots', are available for the folding of single sequences. a variety of 'bulk' servers give less information, but in a shorter time and for up to hundreds of sequences at once. the portal for the mfold web server is http://www.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/mfold. this url will be referred to as 'mfoldroot'.
acneiform rash associated with epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors frequently presents facial manifestations. the treatment modality for such lesions still needs to be elucidated. the aim of this original report was to evaluate the effectiveness of high-level laser therapy in reducing the severity of facial acneiform rash induced by cetuximab, an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors. four patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and two patients with head and neck cancer showing cetuximab-induced facial rash were treated by high-level laser therapy in two 8-min-long consecutive sessions/day over a 4-day treatment. patients wore protective glasses to prevent eye damage related to laser light. subsequently, patients were seen once a week for up to 21 days and after 180 days. during each day of treatment and each follow-up recall, patients were asked to complete a questionnaire about the onset and progression of their acneiform rash (for a total of eight sessions). cetuximab-related toxicity and general discomfort visual analogue scales were also recorded in each of these eight sessions in the treated and control areas in each patient. after the fourth session of high-level laser therapy, the patients showed a noteworthy decrease in both cetuximab-related toxicity and visual analogue scales, up to a complete regression of the lesions at the end of the follow-up in all treated areas. the high-level laser therapy was effective in the healing of acneiform rash associated with epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors with no side effects. background the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of low-level laser therapy (lllt) as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal therapy of smoking and non-smoking patients with moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis.   methods all 36 systemically healthy patients who were included in the study initially received non-surgical periodontal therapy. the lllt group (n = 18) received gaalas diode laser therapy as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal therapy. a diode laser with a wavelength of 808 nm was used for the lllt. energy density of 4 j/cm(2) was applied to the gingival surface after periodontal treatment on the first, second, and seventh days. each of the lllt and control groups was divided into two groups as smoking and non-smoking patients to investigate the effect of smoking on treatment. gingival crevicular fluid samples were collected from all patients and clinical parameters were recorded on baseline, the first, third, and sixth months after treatment. matrix metalloproteinase-1, tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase-1, transforming growth factor-β1, and basic-fibroblast growth factor levels in the collected gingival crevicular fluid were measured.   results the primary outcome variable in this study was change in gingival bleeding and inflammation. at all time points, the lllt group showed significantly more improvement in sulcus bleeding index (sbi), clinical attachment level, and probing depth (pd) levels compared to the control group (p <0.001). there were clinically significant improvements in the laser-applied smokers' pd and sbi levels compared to smokers to whom a laser was not applied, between the baseline and all time points (p <0.001) (sbi score: control group 1.12, lllt group 1.49; pd: control group 1.21 mm, lllt group 1.46 mm, between baseline and 6 months). transforming growth factor-β1 levels and the ratio of matrix metalloproteinase-1 to tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase-1 decreased significantly in both groups at 1, 3, and 6 months after periodontal therapy (p <0.001). basic-fibroblast growth factor levels significantly decreased in both groups in the first month after the treatment, then increased in the third and sixth months (p <0.005). no marker level change showed significant differences between the groups (p <0.05).   conclusion lllt as an adjunctive therapy to non-surgical periodontal treatment improves periodontal healing.
backgroundrac3 coactivator overexpression has been implicated in tumorigenesis, contributing to inhibition of apoptosis and autophagy. both mechanisms are involved in resistance to treatment with chemotherapeutic agents. the aim of this study was to investigate its role in chemoresistance of colorectal cancer.methodsthe sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin in colon cancer cells ht-29, hct 116 and lovo cell lines, expressing high or low natural levels of rac3, was investigated using viability assays.resultsin hct 116 cells, we found that although 5-fluorouracil was a poor inducer of apoptosis, autophagy was strongly induced, while oxaliplatin has shown a similar ability to induce both of them. however, in hct 116 cells expressing a short hairpin rna for rac3, we found an increased sensitivity to both drugs if it is compared with control cells. 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin treatment lead to an enhanced caspase 3-dependent apoptosis and produce an increase of autophagy. in addition, both process have shown to be trigged faster than in control cells, starting earlier after stimulation.conclusionsour results suggest that rac3 expression levels influence the sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs. therefore, the knowledge of rac3 expression levels in tumoral samples could be an important contribution to design new improved therapeutic strategies in the future. rac3 is an oncogene naturally overexpressed in several tumors. besides its role as coactivator, it can exert several protumoral cytoplasmic actions. autophagy was found to act either as a tumor suppressor during the early stages of tumor development, or as a protector of the tumor cell in later stages under hypoxic conditions. we found that rac3 overexpression inhibits autophagy when induced by starvation or rapamycin and involves rac3 nuclear translocation‐dependent and ‐independent mechanisms. moreover, hypoxia inhibits the rac3 gene expression leading to the autophagy process, allowing tumor cells to survive until angiogenesis occurs. the interplay between rac3, hypoxia, and autophagy could be an important mechanism for tumor progression and a good target for a future anticancer therapy.
the operator-based signal separation approach, which formulates the signal separation as an optimization problem, uses an adaptive operator to separate a signal into additive subcomponents. furthermore, it is possible to design different operators to fit different signal models. in this paper, we propose a new kind of differential operator to separate multicomponent am-fm signals. we then use the estimated operators to calculate each sub-component's envelope and instantaneous frequency. to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, we compare the decomposition and am-fm demodulation results of several signals, including real-life signals. the operator-based signal separation approach uses an adaptive operator to separate a signal into additive subcomponents. the approach can be formulated as an optimization problem whose optimal solution can be derived analytically. however, the following issues must still be resolved: estimating the robustness of the operator's parameters and the lagrangian multipliers, and determining how much of the information in the null space of the operator should be retained in the residual signal. to address these problems, we propose a novel optimization formula for operator-based signal separation and show that the parameters of the problem can be estimated adaptively. we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by processing several signals, including real-life signals.
objectives the atraumatic restorative treatment (art) was developed as an affordable, patient-friendly dental caries management procedure that does not need extensive operator training or special skills. the aim of this study was to determine factors that influence the decision to use art using an innovative marketing research technique known as conjoint analysis.   methods a conjoint survey was completed by 723 members of the american academy of pediatric dentistry. three factors (age of the child, level of cooperation, type of insurance) were varied across three levels to create nine patient scenarios. the weights that practitioners placed on these factors in decisions to use art in treating carious lesions were determined by conjoint analysis. factors such as lesion location, depth, and extension were fixed in the nine clinical scenarios.   results seven-hundred twenty-three pediatric dentists completed the survey (32 percent). age of the child was the most important factor in pediatric dentists' decisions to use art (46 percent) compared with level of cooperation (41 percent) and type of insurance coverage (11 percent). for the age factor, the age of 2 years had the greatest utility (0.55) compared with age 4 (-0.09) and age 6 (-0.46). for types of insurance coverage, having no insurance (0.124) had the greatest utility compared with having public insurance (-0.119).   conclusions although insurance coverage was the least important among the factors, being without insurance, being very young, and being uncooperative was the scenario where pediatric dentists most favored art when making trade offs between different factors using the conjoint design. objectives service provision varies by dentist, practice and patient factors. however, limited subsets of these potential influences on service rates have been explored. more comprehensive models could improve our understanding of the factors influencing the pattern of care delivered. the aim of this study was to examine variation in dental services by dentist (treatment choice, practice beliefs, preferences for patients, demographics), practice (type, location, size and volume of practice) and patient (visit, demographic, oral health and socio-economic) characteristics.   methods a random sample of australian dentists was surveyed in 1997-98 (response rate=60.3%). private general practitioners (n=345) provided dentist and practice data, and service provision and patient variables were collected from a log of a typical clinical day (n=4,115 patients). multivariate negative binomial regression models were fitted for diagnostic, preventive, restorative, extraction and prosthodontic services.   results significant dentist factors included (p<0.05; rr=rate ratio): lower diagnostic rates (rr=0.78) for dentists with stronger practice beliefs for giving information about cost and treatment options; preventive rates were lower (rr=0.74) for male dentists and higher (rr=1.48) for younger dentists aged 20-29 years; restorative rates were higher (rr=1.27) for dentists that rated patient preferences more highly in treatment choice and in the dentist age group 30-39 years (rr=1.25); extraction rates were lower (rr=0.61) for dentists with stronger preferences for patients that would adhere with treatment but higher (rr=1.57) for dentists with stronger preferences for sociable patients; and prosthodontic rates were lower (rr=0.38) for dentists with stronger preferences for adaptable patients who were willing to cooperate when expected to do so. practice factors included: higher preventive (rr=1.28) and prosthodontic rates (rr=2.07) in solo practice; higher preventive (rr=1.34) but lower prosthodontic rates (rr=0.42) in capital cities; lower diagnostic (rr=0.82) and extraction rates (rr=0.55) in practices with fewer other dentists; higher diagnostic (rr=1.33) and extraction (rr=1.62) rates but lower restorative rates (rr=0.84) in practices with lower patient visits per year. patient factors included: lower preventive (rr=0.76) but higher extraction rates (rr=1.45) for emergency visits; lower extraction rates (rr=0.60) for the insured; higher diagnostic rates (rr=1.17) for new patients; higher restorative (rr=1.31) but lower prosthodontic rates (rr=0.46) for patients with decayed teeth; higher prosthodontic rates (rr=2.14) for those with dentures; and lower preventive (rr=0.66), but higher extraction (rr=2.22) and prosthodontic rates (rr=1.82) for patients from lower socio-economic status areas.   conclusions dental service rates were influenced by large number of small effects from a wide range of dentist, practice and patient factors. socio-economic and geographic barriers may need broad policy innovations to be addressed, but factors such as insurance and visit type have the potential to be altered to achieve better service outcomes and there is scope for research into clinical outcomes to improve the knowledge upon which treatment decisions are based.
in this paper, we consider the problem of verifying thread-state properties of multithreaded programs in which the number of active threads cannot be statically bounded. our approach is based on decomposing the task into two modules, where one reasons about data and the other reasons about control. the data module computes thread-state invariants (e.g., linear constraints over global variables and local variables of one thread) using the thread interference information computed by the control module. the control module computes a representation of thread interference, as an incrementally constructed data flow graph, using the data invariants provided by the data module. these invariants are used to rule out patterns of thread interference that can not occur in a real program execution. the two modules are incorporated into a feedback loop, so that the abstractions of data and interference are iteratively coarsened as the algorithm progresses (that is, they become weaker) until a fixed point is reached. our approach is sound and terminating, and applicable to programs with infinite state (e.g., unbounded integers) and unboundedly many threads. the verification method presented in this paper has been implemented into a tool, called duet. we demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique by verifying properties of a selection of linux device drivers using duet, and also compare duet with previous work on verification of parameterized boolean program using the boolean abstractions of these drivers. we consider the verification of parameterized boolean programs— abstractions of shared-memory concurrent programs with an unbounded number of threads we propose that such programs can be model-checked by iteratively considering the program under k-round schedules, for increasing values of k, using a novel compositional construct called linear interfaces that summarize the effect of a block of threads in a k-round schedule we also develop a game-theoretic sound technique to show that k rounds of schedule suffice to explore the entire search-space, which allows us to prove a parameterized program entirely correct we implement a symbolic model-checker, and report on experiments verifying parameterized predicate abstractions of linux device drivers interacting with a kernel to show the efficacy of our technique.
in this digital world, transferring sensitive data electronically has become inevitable. the objective of this work is to hide and retrieve confidential information in image mosaics. the photomosaic approach has been used for the creation of the mosaic and the least significant bit (lsb) technique has been adopted for the embedding of the hidden information. the construction of the photomosaic is done by selecting an image, splitting it into smaller images (tiles) of sizes 8×8, 16×16 and 32×32. these tiles are then compared from a very large amount of photos of the same sizes. next, the user can either hide a secret image or a secret text into them. the final mosaic image contains secret information that is well-concealed and is impossible to find out with the naked eye. this technique is more robust compared to modifying the bits of the original image directly. the main aim of the paper is to analyze about security in image transfer through the network. secret- fragment-visible mosaic image is proposed for combining small tiles of secret image to form a target in the sense of mosaic. when this artwork is viewed at close, the observer can view smaller elements, yet when viewed at a distance the collection of tiles blend together to yield the overall picture. when the mosaic generating process starts, original image is divided into many tiles. before splitting the image, compare the image for mosaic creation. mosaic image is created automatically by composing small fragments of a given image in to target image, achieving an effect of embedding the given source image secretly in the resulting mosaic image. to create the mosaic image, first find the similar target image for selected source image. finding the best fit tile for embedding in the target image blocks. the information of placing the tile image fitting sequence in target image is embedding into random selected pixel in created mosaic image. the embedded information act as a text key file. the key file contains the tile image fitting sequence. without this key receiver can't retrieve the secret image.
fur (ferric uptake regulator) proteins are principally responsible for maintaining iron homeostasis in prokaryotes. iron is usually a scarce resource. its limitation reduces photosynthetic rates and cell growth in cyanobacteria in general and especially in cyanobacteria that are fixing dinitrogen, a process that requires the synthesis of numerous proteins with a high content of iron. this paper shows that in the diazotrophic cyanobacterium anabaena sp. strain pcc 7120, levels of fura mrna and fura protein increase significantly in response to nitrogen deprivation, and that fura up-regulation takes place specifically in proheterocysts and mature heterocysts. great differences in a northern blot, probed with fura, of rna from an ntca mutant relative to wild-type anabaena sp. were attributable to binding of ntca, a global regulator of nitrogen metabolism, to the promoter of fura and to the promoter of the fura antisense transcript alr1690-alpha-fura. the fur (ferric uptake regulator) protein is a global regulator in most prokaryotes that controls a large number of genes. fur is a classical repressor that uses ferrous iron as co-repressor and binds to specific dna sequences (iron boxes) as a dimer. three different genes coding for fur homologues have been identified in anabaena sp. pcc 7120. fura controls the transcription of flavodoxin, the product of the isib gene, and is moderately autoregulated. in this work, the promoter of the fura gene was defined and the fura protected regions in the fura and isib promoters were identified, showing that the binding sites for anabaena fura contain a/t-rich sequences with a variable arrangement compared to the conventional 19-base pair fur consensus. the influence of different factors on the interaction between fura and the promoters was evaluated in vitro. the affinity of fura for the dna targets was significantly affected by the redox status of this regulator and the presence of mn2+. the optimal binding conditions were observed in the presence of both mn2+ and dtt. those results suggest that, in addition to iron availability, fura–dna interaction is modulated by redox conditions.
lignin biosynthesis is a major carbon sink in gymnosperms and woody angiosperms. many of the enzymes involved are encoded for by several genes, some of which are also related to the biosynthesis of other phenylpropanoids. in this study, we aimed at the identification of those gene family members that are responsible for developmental lignification in norway spruce (picea abies (l.) karst.). gene expression across the whole lignin biosynthetic pathway was profiled using est sequencing and quantitative real-time rt-pcr. stress-induced lignification during bending stress and heterobasidion annosum infection was also studied. altogether 7,189 ests were sequenced from a lignin forming tissue culture and developing xylem of spruce, and clustered into 3,831 unigenes. several paralogous genes were found for both monolignol biosynthetic and polymerisation-related enzymes. real-time rt-pcr results highlighted the set of monolignol biosynthetic genes that are likely to be responsible for developmental lignification in norway spruce. potential genes for monolignol polymerisation were also identified. in compression wood, mostly the same monolignol biosynthetic gene set was expressed, but peroxidase expression differed from the vertically grown control. pathogen infection in phloem resulted in a general up-regulation of the monolignol biosynthetic pathway, and in an induction of a few new gene family members. based on the up-regulation under both pathogen attack and in compression wood, papal2, papx2 and papx3 appeared to have a general stress-induced function. the gene ontology project (http://www.geneontology.org/) produces structured, controlled vocabularies and gene product annotations. gene products are classified according to the cellular locations and biological process in which they act, and the molecular functions that they carry out. we annotate gene products from a broad range of model species and provide support for those groups that wish to contribute annotation of further model species. the gene ontology facilitates the exchange of information between groups of scientists studying similar processes in different model organisms, and so provides a broad range of opportunities for plant scientists.
this report presents an algorithm to assist primary care physicians, endocrinologists, and others in the management of adult, nonpregnant patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. in order to minimize the risk of diabetes-related complications, the goal of therapy is to achieve a hemoglobin a1c (a1c) of 6.5% or less, with recognition of the need for individualization to minimize the risks of hypoglycemia. we provide therapeutic pathways stratified on the basis of current levels of a1c, whether the patient is receiving treatment or is drug naïve. we consider monotherapy, dual therapy, and triple therapy, including 8 major classes of medications (biguanides, dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors, incretin mimetics, thiazolidinediones, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, sulfonylureas, meglitinides, and bile acid sequestrants) and insulin therapy (basal, premixed, and multiple daily injections), with or without orally administered medications. we prioritize choices of medications according to safety, risk of hypoglycemia, efficacy, simplicity, anticipated degree of patient adherence, and cost of medications. we recommend only combinations of medications approved by the us food and drug administration that provide complementary mechanisms of action. it is essential to monitor therapy with a1c and self-monitoring of blood glucose and to adjust or advance therapy frequently (every 2 to 3 months) if the appropriate goal for each patient has not been achieved. we provide a flow-chart and table summarizing the major considerations. this algorithm represents a consensus of 14 highly experienced clinicians, clinical researchers, practitioners, and academicians and is based on the american association of clinical endocrinologists/american college of endocrinology diabetes guidelines and the recent medical literature. the evidence-based canadian diabetes association (cda) 2008 clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of diabetes in canada (1) differ from the consensus statement by nathan et al. (2), although both were published virtually at the same time. the consensus statement, which represents the authors’ collective analysis, evaluation, and opinion, is said not to represent official association opinion, yet it is listed as a consensus statement of the american diabetes association and the european association for the study of diabetes. in contrast, the cda clinical practice guidelines do represent the cda's official position. the cda clinical practice guidelines follow the agree (appraisal of guidelines for research and evaluation) instrument (3) and have a standardized evidence-based approach to …
the establishment of a multicellular body plan requires coordinating changes in cell adhesion and the cytoskeleton to ensure proper cell shape and position within a tissue. cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ecm) via integrins plays diverse, essential roles during animal embryogenesis and therefore must be precisely regulated. talin, a ferm-domain containing protein, forms a direct link between integrin adhesion receptors and the actin cytoskeleton and is an important regulator of integrin function. similar to other ferm proteins, talin makes an intramolecular interaction that could autoinhibit its activity. however, the functional consequence of such an interaction has not been previously explored in vivo. here, we demonstrate that targeted disruption of talin autoinhibition gives rise to morphogenetic defects during fly development and specifically that dorsal closure (dc), a process that resembles wound healing, is delayed. impairment of autoinhibition leads to reduced talin turnover at and increased talin and integrin recruitment to sites of integrin-ecm attachment. finally, we present evidence that talin autoinhibition is regulated by rap1-dependent signaling. based on our data, we propose that talin autoinhibition provides a switch for modulating adhesion turnover and adhesion stability that is essential for morphogenesis. the mammalian focal adhesion kinase (fak) family of non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases has been implicated in controlling a multitude of cellular responses to the engagement of cell-surface integrins and g-protein-coupled receptors. the high level of sequence conservation between the mammalian proteins and the drosophila homologue of fak, fak56, suggested that it would have similar functions. however, we show here that drosophila fak56 is not essential for integrin functions in adhesion, migration or signaling in vivo. furthermore, animals lacking fak56 are viable and fertile, demonstrating that fak56 is not essential for other developmental or physiological functions. despite this, overexpressed fak56 is a potent inhibitor of integrins binding to the extracellular matrix, suggesting that fak56 may play a subtle role in the negative regulation of integrin adhesion.
binding of the escherichia coli global transcription factor fis to the upstream activating sequence (uas) of stable rna promoters activates transcription on the outgrowth of cells from stationary phase. paradoxically, while these promoters require negative supercoiling of dna for optimal activity, fis counteracts the increase of negative superhelical density by dna gyrase. we demonstrate that binding of fis at the uas protects the rrna p1 promoter from inactivation at suboptimal superhelical densities. this effect is correlated with fis‐dependent constraint of writhe and facilitated untwisting of promoter dna. we infer that fis maintains stable rna transcription by stabilizing local writhe in the uas. these results suggest a novel mechanism of transcriptional regulation by a transcription factor acting as a local topological homeostat. the escherichia coli dna‐binding protein fis serves as a dna architectural factor in two unrelated enzymatic reactions, the site‐specific inversion of dna and transcriptional activation of stable rna promoters. in both these processes, fis facilitates the assembly and dynamic transitions of two structurally distinct nucleoprotein complexes. we have proposed previously that, in these systems, fis stabilizes writhed dna microloops by binding at multiple helically phased sites in dna. however, fis also binds and bends dna at many non‐specific sites and, at its maximum levels in the early exponential phase, fis could potentially occupy a considerable part of the e. coli chromosome. here, we show that fis affects growth phase‐specific alterations in the supercoiling level of dna. expression of fis accelerates the accumulation of moderately supercoiled plasmids in stationary phase, which are stabilized by fis after nutritional shift‐up. in accordance with such a function, fis modulates the relaxing and supercoiling activities of topoisomerases in vitro in a way that keeps dna in a moderately supercoiled state. our results suggest that the primary role of fis is to modulate chromosomal dynamics during bacterial growth.
when faced with a problem or choice, humans can use two different strategies: “cognitive reflectivity,” which involves slow responses and fewer mistakes, or “cognitive impulsivity,” which comprises of quick responses and more mistakes. different individuals use these two strategies differently. to our knowledge, no study has directly investigated the brain regions involved in reflectivity–impulsivity; therefore, this study focused on associations between these cognitive strategies and the gray matter structure of several brain regions. in order to accomplish this, we enrolled 776 healthy, right-handed individuals (432 men and 344 women; 20.7 ± 1.8 years) and used voxel-based morphometry with administration of a cognitive reflectivity–impulsivity questionnaire. we found that high cognitive reflectivity was associated with greater regional gray matter density in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex. our finding suggests that this area plays an important role in defining an individual’s trait associated with reflectivity and impulsivity. in this study, we describe a psychobiological model of the structure and development of personality that accounts for dimensions of both temperament and character. previous research has confirmed four dimensions of temperament: novelty seeking, harm avoidance, reward dependence, and persistence, which are independently heritable, manifest early in life, and involve preconceptual biases in perceptual memory and habit formation. for the first time, we describe three dimensions of character that mature in adulthood and influence personal and social effectiveness by insight learning about self-concepts. self-concepts vary according to the extent to which a person identifies the self as (1) an autonomous individual, (2) an integral part of humanity, and (3) an integral part of the universe as a whole. each aspect of self-concept corresponds to one of three character dimensions called self-directedness, cooperativeness, and self-transcendence, respectively. we also describe the conceptual background and development of a self-report measure of these dimensions, the temperament and character inventory. data on 300 individuals from the general population support the reliability and structure of these seven personality dimensions. we discuss the implications for studies of information processing, inheritance, development, diagnosis, and treatment.
many corporate mergers fail to achieve their inte nded objectives. the literature indicates that slow post -merger integrations are partly responsible for such failure and highlights that a successful post -merger integration is essential to a successful merger. recognizing the fact that information system s (is) integration is important for effective merger performance and that few is and merger research has addressed this area, the objective of this article is to focus on organizational and information systems factors that affect post -merger is integration performance with the eventual aim of identifying ways in which to manage the significant factors post -merger. this research is timely and relevant and will contribute to the body of research that facilitates the understanding and management of merger eff ectiveness and its associated processes. abstract the process of integrating information systems (is) during corporate mergers can be critical to their success. factors that can support or impede the successful integration of is include organizational and is attributes, organizational merger management and is integration activities. this study develops a conceptual framework for measuring is integration success and identifies the factors influencing it. a field survey investigates the relationship between these factors and success. according to the results of our field survey of cios, prior merger experience, is participation in merger planning, the quality of merger planning, the criteria used for setting is integration priorities, and a high level of data sharing across applications appear to have a positive influence on the success of the is integration. when changes that directly affect personnel have a significant impact, that impact seems to be mostly negative. programming language incompatibilities also have a negative impact on is integration success.
the lateral septum has strong efferent projections to hypothalamic and midbrain regions, and has been associated with modulation of social behavior, anxiety, fear conditioning, memory-related behaviors, and the mesolimbic reward pathways. understanding natural variation of lateral septal anatomy and function, as well as its genetic modulation, may provide important insights into individual differences in these evolutionarily important functions. here we address these issues by using efficient and unbiased stereological probes to estimate the volume of the lateral septum in the bxd line of recombinant inbred mice. lateral septum volume is a highly variable trait, with a 2.5-fold difference among animals. we find that this trait covaries with a number of behavioral and physiological phenotypes, many of which have already been associated with behaviors modulated by the lateral septum, such as spatial learning, anxiety, and reward-seeking. heritability of lateral septal volume is moderate (h 2 = 0.52), and much of the heritable variation is caused by a locus on the distal portion of chromosome (chr) 1. composite interval analysis identified a secondary interval on chr 2 that works additively with the chr 1 locus to increase lateral septum volume. using bioinformatic resources, we identified plausible candidate genes in both intervals that may influence the volume of this key nucleus, as well as associated behaviors. backgroundquantitative trait locus (qtl) mapping identifies genomic regions that likely contain genes regulating a quantitative trait. however, qtl regions may encompass tens to hundreds of genes. to find the most promising candidate genes that regulate the trait, the biologist typically collects information from multiple resources about the genes in the qtl interval. this process is very laborious and time consuming.resultsqtlminer is a bioinformatics tool that automatically performs qtl region analysis. it is available in genenetwork and it integrates information such as gene annotation, gene expression and sequence polymorphisms for all the genes within a given genomic interval.conclusionsqtlminer substantially speeds up discovery of the most promising candidate genes within a qtl region.
although the various manifestations of disordered thought have played a central role in diagnostic and theoretical considerations of schizophrenia, such symptoms have not been found specific to schizophrenia, and at best have shown weak relations to outcome. as part of a 7-year followup study of a sample of young, acute, psychotic inpatients, we explored the hypothesis that despite these poor results there might be particular components of disordered thought that might have prognostic utility and be able to discriminate narrowly defined schizophrenics. using extant symptom scales as our models, we constructed five internally consistent scales of disordered thought from behavioral ratings made using the psychotic inpatient profile--poverty of speech, attentional impairment, incoherence, delusions, and hallucinations. we tested the ability of these scales to predict various aspects of outcome adaptation including outcome diagnosis. in general, the attentional impairment scale demonstrated the best prognostic utility, predicting poorer outcome in several domains. paradoxically, patients diagnosed by research diagnostic criteria (rdc) as definite schizophrenic at outcome had been rated as showing less attentional impairment than probable and nonschizophrenics. an examination of the pattern of correlations between attentional impairment and performance on cognitive tasks suggested that attentional difficulties may be related to different underlying cognitive processes in those diagnosed schizophrenic and nonschizophrenic at outcome by rdc. behavioral data on a large patient group were collected by investigators from nine countries in the international pilot study of schizophrenia, sponsored by the world health organization. the data on half the group were analyzed to derive a system of 12 signs and symptoms for the identification of schizophrenia, as this disorder is diagnosed in many centers throughout the world. the findings were replicated with the other half of the patient group. the criteria constitute an operational method for identifying patients who would be commonly considered schizophrenic in many centers.
the basic structure of the cortico-hippocampal system is highly conserved across mammalian species. comparatively few hippocampal neurons can represent and address a multitude of cortical patterns, establish associations between cortical patterns and consolidate these associations in the cortex. in this study, we investigate how elementary anatomical properties in the cortex-hippocampus loop along with synaptic plasticity contribute to these functions. specifically, we focus on the high degree of connectivity between cortex and hippocampus leading to converging and diverging forward and backward projections and heterogenous synaptic transmission delays that result from the detached location of the hippocampus and its multiple loops. we found that in a model incorporating these concepts, each cortical pattern can evoke a unique spatio-temporal spiking pattern in hippocampal neurons. this hippocampal response facilitates a reliable disambiguation of learned associations and a bridging of a time interval larger than the time window of spike-timing dependent plasticity in the cortex. moreover, we found that repeated retrieval of a stored association leads to a compression of the interval between cue presentation and retrieval of the associated pattern from the cortex. neither a high degree of connectivity nor heterogenous synaptic delays alone is sufficient for this behavior. we conclude that basic anatomical properties between cortex and hippocampus implement mechanisms for representing and consolidating temporal information. since our model reveals the observed functions for a range of parameters, we suggest that these functions are robust to evolutionary changes consistent with the preserved function of the hippocampal loop across different species. we present a minimal spiking network that can polychronize, that is, exhibit reproducible time-locked but not synchronous firing patterns with millisecond precision, as in synfire braids. the network consists of cortical spiking neurons with axonal conduction delays and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (stdp); a ready-to-use matlab code is included. it exhibits sleeplike oscillations, gamma (40 hz) rhythms, conversion of firing rates to spike timings, and other interesting regimes. due to the interplay between the delays and stdp, the spiking neurons spontaneously self-organize into groups and generate patterns of stereotypical polychronous activity. to our surprise, the number of coexisting polychronous groups far exceeds the number of neurons in the network, resulting in an unprecedented memory capacity of the system. we speculate on the significance of polychrony to the theory of neuronal group selection (tngs, neural darwinism), cognitive neural computations, binding and gamma rhythm, mechanisms of attention, and consciousness as attention to memories.
although current evidence is limited, obstructive sleep apnea (osa) has been suggested as a risk factor for morbidity after primary joint arthroplasty. our objective was to determine if patients with osa have a higher likelihood of postoperative in-hospital complications or increased costs after revision arthroplasty. the nationwide inpatient sample was used to identify 258,455 patients who underwent revision total hip arthroplasty or revision total knee arthroplasty between 2006 and 2008. of these patients, 16,608 (6.4%) had been diagnosed with osa. multivariate analysis with logistic regression modeling was used to compare patients with and without osa. obstructive sleep apnea was associated with increased in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 1.9; p = .002), pulmonary embolism (odds ratio, 2.1; p = .001), wound hematomas or seromas (odds ratio, 1.36; p < .001), and increased postoperative charges ($61,044 vs $58,813; p < .001). further research is warranted. administrative databases are increasingly used for studying outcomes of medical care. valid inferences from such data require the ability to account for disease severity and comorbid conditions. we adapted a clinical comorbidity index, designed for use with medical records, for research relying on international classification of diseases (icd-9-cm) diagnosis and procedure codes. the association of this adapted index with health outcomes and resource use was then examined with a sample of medicare beneficiaries who underwent lumbar spine surgery in 1985 (n = 27,111). the index was associated in the expected direction with postoperative complications, mortality, blood transfusion, discharge to nursing home, length of hospital stay, and hospital charges. these associations were observed whether the index incorporated data from multiple hospitalizations over a year's time, or just from the index surgical admission. they also persisted after controlling for patient age. we conclude that the adapted comorbidity index will be useful in studies of disease outcome and resource use employing administrative databases.
pcr‐based gene targeting is a popular method for manipulating yeast genes in their normal chromosomal locations. the manual design of primers, however, can be cumbersome and error‐prone. we have developed a straightforward web‐based tool that applies user‐specified inputs to automate and simplify the task of primer selection for deletion, tagging and/or regulated expression of genes in schizosaccharomyces pombe. this tool, named pppp (for pombe pcr primer programs), is available at http://www.sanger.ac.uk/postgenomics/s_pombe/software/. we also present a searchable microarray primer database to retrieve the sequences and accompanying information for primers and pcr products used to build our in‐house sz. pombe microarrays. this database contains information on both coding and intergenic regions to provide context for the microarray data, and it should be useful also for other applications, such as quantitative pcr. the database can be accessed at http://www.sanger.ac.uk/postgenomics/s_pombe/microarray/. copyright © 2006 john wiley & sons, ltd. we have sequenced and annotated the genome of fission yeast (schizosaccharomyces pombe), which contains the smallest number of protein-coding genes yet recorded for a eukaryote: 4,824. the centromeres are between 35 and 110 kilobases (kb) and contain related repeats including a highly conserved 1.8-kb element. regions upstream of genes are longer than in budding yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae), possibly reflecting more-extended control regions. some 43% of the genes contain introns, of which there are 4,730. fifty genes have significant similarity with human disease genes; half of these are cancer related. we identify highly conserved genes important for eukaryotic cell organization including those required for the cytoskeleton, compartmentation, cell-cycle control, proteolysis, protein phosphorylation and rna splicing. these genes may have originated with the appearance of eukaryotic life. few similarly conserved genes that are important for multicellular organization were identified, suggesting that the transition from prokaryotes to eukaryotes required more new genes than did the transition from unicellular to multicellular organization.
this study was performed to determine the effectiveness of the rho kinase inhibitor and nf-kappab inhibitor in renal injury of ang ii-infused hypertensive rats. male sprague-dawley rats, maintained on a normal diet, received either a sham operation (n = 7) or continuous ang ii infusion (120 ng/min) subcutaneously via minipumps. the ang ii-infused rats were further subdivided into three subgroups (n = 7 each) to receive one of the following treatments during the entire period: vehicle, rho kinase inhibitor (fasudil; 3 mg.kg(-1).day(-1) ip), or nf-kappab inhibitor (parthenolide; 1 mg.kg(-1).day(-1) ip). after 12 days of ang ii infusion, systolic blood pressure (bp; 208 +/- 7 vs. 136 +/- 3 mmhg), rho kinase activity, nf-kappab activity, renal ang ii contents (160 +/- 25 vs. 84 +/- 14 pg/g), monocytic chemotactic protein (mcp) 1 mrna, interstitial macrophage infiltration, transforming growth factor-beta1 (tgf-beta1) mrna, interstitial collagen-positive area, urinary protein excretion (43 +/- 6 vs. 11 +/- 2 mg/day), and urinary albumin excretion were significantly enhanced compared with the sham group. while fasudil or parthenolide did not alter systolic bp (222 +/- and 190 +/- 21, respectively), both treatments completely blocked ang ii-induced enhancement of nf-kappab activity, renal ang ii contents (103 +/- 11 and 116 +/- 21 pg/g, respectively), mcp1 mrna, interstitial macrophage infiltration, tgf-beta1 mrna, interstitial collagen-positive area, urinary protein excretion (28 +/- 6 and 23 +/- 3 mg/day, respectively), and urinary albumin excretion. importantly, parthenolide did not alter ang ii-induced rho kinase activation although fasudil abolished ang ii-induced rho kinase activation. these data indicate that the rho-nf-kappab axis plays crucial roles in the development of ang ii-induced renal injury independently from bp regulation. angiotensin ii (ang ii) is now believed to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of hypertrophy and/or hyperplasia of vascular smooth muscle cells (vsmcs). several g(i)- and g(q)-coupled receptors, including the ang ii type 1 (at(1)) receptor, activate rho and rho-associated kinase in swiss 3t3 cells and cardiac myocytes. however, little is known about the role of rho-kinase in ang ii-induced vascular hypertrophy in vsmcs. in the present study, we explored the role of rho and rho-kinase in ang ii-induced protein synthesis in vsmcs. in unstimulated cells, rhoa was observed predominantly in the cytosolic fraction, but it was translocated in part to the particulate fraction in response to ang ii (100 nmol/l). this effect was completely blocked by the at(1) receptor blocker candesartan but not by the ang ii type 2 (at(2)) receptor antagonist pd123319. botulinum c(3) exoenzyme, which inactivated rhoa, attenuated ang ii-induced [(3)h]leucine incorporation. the specific rho-kinase inhibitor, y-27632, dose-dependently abolished ang ii-induced protein synthesis and also suppressed ang ii-induced c-fos mrna expression. on the other hand, y-27632 had no effect on ang ii-stimulated phosphorylation of p70 s6 kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, which are reported to be involved in ang ii-induced protein synthesis, nor had it any effect on the ang ii-induced phosphorylation of phas-i, a heat- and acid-stable eif-4e-binding protein. the phosphorylation of phas-i is regulating for translation initiation. these observations suggest that the rho, rho-kinase, and c-fos pathways may play a role in ang ii-induced hypertrophic changes of vsmcs through a novel pathway.
ensemble classifiers have become an established research line in the field of mining time-changing data streams. however, in environments where class labels are available after each example, ensembles which process instances in blocks do not react to sudden changes sufficiently quickly. on the other hand, existing online ensemble algorithms, which process streams incrementally, do not take advantage of periodical weighting mechanisms known from block-based ensembles, which offer accurate reactions to gradual and recurring changes. in this paper, we analyze if and how the characteristics of block and incremental processing can be combined to produce accurate ensemble classifiers. we propose and experimentally evaluate three strategies to transforming a block ensemble into an online learner: the use of a sliding window, an additional incrementally trained ensemble member, and a drift detector. the obtained results verify, which of these approaches is most effective and what characteristics of block processing are most beneficial in online most machine learning algorithms assume stationary environments, require a large number of training examples in advance, and begin the learning from scratch. in contrast, humans learn in changing environments with sequential training examples and leverage prior knowledge in new situations. to deal with real-world problems in changing environments, the ability to make human-like quick responses must be developed in machines.    many researchers have presented learning systems that assume the presence of hidden context and concept drift. in particular, several systems have been proposed that use ensembles of classifiers on sequential chunks of training examples. these systems can respond to gradual changes in large-scale data streams but have problems responding to sudden changes and leveraging prior knowledge of recurring contexts. moreover, these are not pure online learning systems.    we propose an online learning system that uses an ensemble of classifiers suited to recent training examples. we use experiments to show that this system can leverage prior knowledge of recurring contexts and is robust against various noise levels and types of drift.
purpose because of the retina's role in refractive development, this study was conducted to analyze the retinal transcriptome in chicks wearing a spectacle lens, a well-established means of inducing refractive errors, to identify gene expression alterations and to develop novel mechanistic hypotheses about refractive development.   methods one-week-old white leghorn chicks wore a unilateral spectacle lens of +15 or -15 d for 6 hours or 3 days. with total rna from the retina/(retinal pigment epithelium, rpe), chicken gene microarrays were used to compare gene expression levels between lens-wearing and contralateral control eyes (n = 6 chicks for each condition). normalized microarray signal intensities were evaluated by analysis of variance, using a false discovery rate of <10% as the statistical criterion. selected differentially expressed genes were validated by qpcr.   results very few retina/rpe transcripts were differentially expressed after plus lens wear. in contrast, approximately 1300 transcripts were differentially expressed under each of the minus lens conditions, with minimal overlap. for each condition, low fold-changes typified the altered transcriptome. differentially regulated genes under the minus lens conditions included many potentially informative signaling molecules and genes whose protein products have roles in intrinsic retinal circadian rhythms.   conclusions plus or minus lens wear induce markedly different, not opposite, alterations in retina/rpe gene expression. the initial retinal responses to defocus are quite different from those when the eye growth patterns are well established, suggesting that different mechanisms govern the initiation and persistence or progression of refractive errors. the gene lists identify promising signaling candidates and regulatory pathways for future study, including a potential role for circadian rhythms in refractive development. (1) we studied the influence of photoperiod and unilateral lid suture on post-natal ocular growth in two types of white leghorn chicks previously reported to respond differently to visual deprivation, truslow and cornell k chicks. we analyzed the chicks after 2 weeks of rearing, a time period commonly used in neuropharmacological studies of eye growth but much shorter than in most prior studies of photoperiod effects on the chick eye. (2) altering the photoperiod length significantly influenced the refraction and growth of both open and sutured eyes even at this early time, with differences between the two types of chicks. (3) the most prominent effect on the open eyes was the development of hyperopia with rearing under constant light, a response especially prominent in the cornell k chicks. in the open eyes under this condition, the anterior chamber shallowed and the vitreous chamber elongated in the axial dimension only, reciprocal changes that resulted in no net alteration of axial length at 2 weeks. a high variability in refraction of open eyes reared with constant illumination suggests the need for a dark period in the regulation of eye growth. (4) compared to contralateral open eyes, the lid-sutured eyes of both types of chicks developed longer total axial lengths and enlarged vitreous chambers in both axial and equatorial dimensions under each photoperiod. the effects on anterior chamber depth and refraction were complex and differed between the two types of chicks. (5) the responses in open eyes support the notion that growth of the vitrious chamber of the chick eye is differentially regulated in the axial and equatorial dimensions, previously indicated by pharmacological studies. the responses in both open and sutured eyes indicate different control mechanisms for anterior chamber and vitreous cavity growth.
path integration, the constant updating of the navigator's knowledge of position and orientation during movement, requires both visuospatial knowledge and memory. this study aimed to develop a systems‐level understanding of human path integration by examining the basic building blocks of path integration in humans. to achieve this goal, we used functional imaging to examine the neural mechanisms that support the tracking and memory of translational and rotational components of human path integration. critically, and in contrast to previous studies, we examined movement in translation and rotation tasks with no defined end‐point or goal. navigators accumulated translational and rotational information during virtual self‐motion. activity in hippocampus, retrosplenial cortex (rsc), and parahippocampal cortex (phc) increased during both translation and rotation encoding, suggesting that these regions track self‐motion information during path integration. these results address current questions regarding distance coding in the human brain. by implementing a modified delayed match to sample paradigm, we also examined the encoding and maintenance of path integration signals in working memory. hippocampus, phc, and rsc were recruited during successful encoding and maintenance of path integration information, with rsc selective for tasks that required processing heading rotation changes. these data indicate distinct working memory mechanisms for translation and rotation, which are essential for updating neural representations of current location. the results provide evidence that hippocampus, phc, and rsc flexibly track task‐relevant translation and rotation signals for path integration and could form the hub of a more distributed network supporting spatial navigation. hum brain mapp 37:3636–3655, 2016. © 2016 wiley periodicals, inc. cluster-extent based thresholding is currently the most popular method for multiple comparisons correction of statistical maps in neuroimaging studies, due to its high sensitivity to weak and diffuse signals. however, cluster-extent based thresholding provides low spatial specificity; researchers can only infer that there is signal somewhere within a significant cluster and cannot make inferences about the statistical significance of specific locations within the cluster. this poses a particular problem when one uses a liberal cluster-defining primary threshold (i.e., higher p-values), which often produces large clusters spanning multiple anatomical regions. in such cases, it is impossible to reliably infer which anatomical regions show true effects. from a survey of 814 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) studies published in 2010 and 2011, we show that the use of liberal primary thresholds (e.g., p<.01) is endemic, and that the largest determinant of the primary threshold level is the default option in the software used. we illustrate the problems with liberal primary thresholds using an fmri dataset from our laboratory (n=33), and present simulations demonstrating the detrimental effects of liberal primary thresholds on false positives, localization, and interpretation of fmri findings. to avoid these pitfalls, we recommend several analysis and reporting procedures, including 1) setting primary p<.001 as a default lower limit; 2) using more stringent primary thresholds or voxel-wise correction methods for highly powered studies; and 3) adopting reporting practices that make the level of spatial precision transparent to readers. we also suggest alternative and supplementary analysis methods.
abstractcontext identifying the drivers shaping biological assemblages in fragmented tropical landscapes is critical for designing effective conservation strategies. it is still unclear, however, whether tropical biodiversity is more strongly affected by forest loss, by its spatial configuration or by matrix composition across different spatial scales.objectives assessing the relative influence of forest patch and landscape attributes on dung beetle assemblages in the fragmented lacandona rainforest, mexico.methodsusing a multimodel inference approach we tested the relative impact of forest patch size and landscape forest cover (measures of forest amount at the patch and landscape scales, respectively), patch shape and isolation (forest configuration indices at the patch scale), forest fragmentation (forest configuration index at the landscape scale), and matrix composition on the diversity, abundance and biomass of dung beetles.resultspatch size, landscape forest cover and matrix composition were the best predictors of dung beetle assemblages. species richness, beetle abundance, and biomass decreased in smaller patches surrounded by a lower percentage of forest cover, and in landscapes dominated by open-area matrices. community evenness also increased under these conditions due to the loss of rare species.conclusionsforest loss at the patch and landscape levels and matrix composition show a larger impact on dung beetles than forest spatial configuration. to preserve dung beetle assemblages, and their key functional roles in the ecosystem, conservation initiatives should prioritize a reduction in deforestation and an increase in the heterogeneity of the matrix surrounding forest remnants. contrary to common belief, decomposition of diversity into independent richness and evenness components is mathematically impossible. however, richness can be decomposed into independent diversity and evenness or inequality components. the evenness or inequality component derived in this way is connected to most of the common measures of evenness and inequality in ecology and economics. this perspective justifies the derivation of measures of relative evenness, which give the amount of evenness relative to the maximum and minimum possible for a given richness. pielou’s [1] evenness measure j is shown to be such a measure.
the impact of women’s education on fertility is of interest to researchers, particularly in china. however, few studies have provided well-founded assessments of how women’s education, workforce experience, and birth control policy jointly affect fertility in china. this study, conducted in guangdong province, aimed to analyze how these three factors influenced the timing of births and affected women at different stages of their reproductive lives. we used census data for guangdong province (1990, 2000, and 2010) to make cross-sectional age-specific comparisons to examine the effects of women’s education and workforce participation on fertility outcomes under china’s one child policy. we found that: (1) under circumstances of low fertility, women tend to have more children with greater educational attainment; (2) the impact of women’s education and workforce experience on fertility varied across age groups, with the effect of education showing a bimodal curve peaking at 25–29 years and 40–44 years, and a workforce experience effect at 25–34 years; and (3) the fertility time-squeeze effect by educational attainment was relatively small, the effect by workforce participation was larger, and the most important effect was birth control policy and its implementation. these results suggest that educational attainment and workforce experience have a substantial effect on women’s fertility, and a tradeoff between them is unavoidable. china’s 2015 birth control policy adjustment should be considered in planning future services to accommodate anticipated increases in the birth rate. more attention should be directed to the causal mechanism (women’s preference and selection effects) behind the factors analyzed in this study. this paper presents a data set that improves the measurement of educational attainment for a broad group of countries. we extend our previous estimates of educational attainment for the population over age 15 and over age 25 up to 1995 and provide projections for 2000. we discuss the estimation method for the measures of educational attainment and relate our estimates to alternative international measures of human capital stocks.
distracting gaze has been shown to elicit automatic gaze following. however, it is still debated whether the effects of perceived gaze are a simple automatic spatial orienting response or are instead sensitive to the context (i.e. goals and task demands). in three experiments, we investigated the conditions under which gaze following occurs. participants were instructed to saccade towards one of two lateral targets. a face distracter, always present in the background, could gaze towards: (a) a task-relevant target––(“matching” goal-directed gaze shift)––congruent or incongruent with the instructed direction, (b) a task-irrelevant target, orthogonal to the one instructed (“non-matching” goal-directed gaze shift), or (c) an empty spatial location (no-goal-directed gaze shift). eye movement recordings showed faster saccadic latencies in correct trials in congruent conditions especially when the distracting gaze shift occurred before the instruction to make a saccade. interestingly, while participants made a higher proportion of gaze-following errors (i.e. errors in the direction of the distracting gaze) in the incongruent conditions when the distracter’s gaze shift preceded the instruction onset indicating an automatic gaze following, they never followed the distracting gaze when it was directed towards an empty location or a stimulus that was never the target. taken together, these findings suggest that gaze following is likely to be a product of both automatic and goal-driven orienting mechanisms. in this study we investigated the tendency of humans to imitate the gaze direction of other individuals. distracting gaze stimuli or non biological directional cues (arrows) were presented to observers performing an instructed saccadic eye movement task. eye movement recordings showed that observers performed less accurately when the distracting gaze and the instructed saccade had opposite directions, with a substantial number of saccades matching the direction of the distracting gaze. static (experiment 1) and dynamic (experiment 2) gaze distracters, but not pointing arrows (experiment 3), produced the effect. results show a strong predisposition of humans to imitate somebody else's oculomotor behaviour, even when detrimental to task performance. this is likely linked to a strong tendency to share attentional states of other individuals, known as joint attention.
background individuals’ attitudes towards depression and its treatments may influence their likelihood of seeking professional help and adherence to treatment when depressed. objective measures, such as the attitudes towards depression and its treatments scale (atdt), have been developed to assess such attitudes. the aims of this research were to test the reliability and validity of atdt on an australian sample who were not depressed during the study or who had previously been depressed, to explore the attitudes of the australian public towards depression, and to compare these attitudes to those of a canadian sample of people with depression. methods a sample of 63 males and 140 females (mean age = 32.2 years, sd = 12.9 years) from melbourne, australia took part in this study. fourteen of the males and 52 of the female participants (mean age = 35.4 years, sd = 13.2 years) stated that they had been previously diagnosed with depression. results the attitudes of the australian sample and the subset of that sample who had previously experienced depression differed from those of the canadian outpatient sample: they were less ashamed of depression, more likely to take antidepressants and consider psychotherapy, and more likely to seek help from professionals or significant others in their lives. however, those in the australian sample were more likely to report that antidepressants made them lose control, and they were less willing to consider electric shock as a treatment option for their depression. the internal reliability as measured by cronbach’s alpha was lower in the current study (0.63 and 0.57 for both the general public and the depressed australian sample) than in the canadian study. confirmatory factor analysis failed to replicate the factor structure reported previously. limitations the australian sample of this study may be underrepresentative due to the sampling methods used, and the high proportion of females should not be overlooked. conclusion researchers should be vigilant when utilizing measures constructed in different countries. in comparison to the canadians, the selected australian sample had more positive attitudes towards depression and its available treatments. the atdt scale was not a reliable and valid measure in this sample. objective to develop and psychometrically assess an instrument to measure patients' attitudes towards depression, to its treatments, and aspects of professional help in patients suffering from depression.   method a 27 item likert type instrument was developed and written based on an evidence from a literature review and in consultation with experts in depression. psychiatrists (n=12) participated in a validation process of the instrument before it was administered to outpatients (n=63) suffering from non-psychotic depression.   results internal consistency reliability for the instrument was 0.79 (cronbach's alpha) and there was 88% overall agreement between experts about the relevance of the instruments' items to test patients' attitudes to depression and its treatments, providing evidence for content validity. factor analysis resulted in five cohesive and theoretically meaningful factors: 1) acceptance of treatment, 2) perceived stigma and shame, 3) negative attitude towards antidepressants, 4) self stigma, and 5) preference for psychotherapy.   conclusion the developed instrument is a reliable, valid and empirical measure to assess attitudes towards depression and its treatments. future research should be designed to replicate and extend the present findings with larger and more heterogeneous samples.
full-field laser speckle microscopy provides real-time imaging of superficial blood flow rate. here we apply continuous wavelet transform to time series of speckle-estimated blood flow from each pixel of the images to map synchronous patterns in instantaneous frequency and phase on the surface of rat kidneys. the regulatory mechanism in the renal microcirculation generates oscillations in arterial blood flow at several characteristic frequencies. our approach to laser speckle image processing allows detection of frequency and phase entrainments, visualization of their patterns, and estimation of the extent of synchronization in renal cortex dynamics. a new noninvasive technique for monitoring capillary blood flow has been developed. based on the phenomenon  of time-varying laser speckle, it is a digital version of single-exposure speckle photography. it  provides a velocity map of the area of interest in real time without the need for scanning. the results of some initial experiments on volunteers are presented.
developmentally regulated cell cycle arrest is a fundamental feature of neurogenesis, whose significance is poorly understood. during drosophila sensory organ (so) development, primary progenitor (pi) cells arrest in g2 phase for precisely defined periods. upon re-entering the cell cycle in response to developmental signals, these g2-arrested precursor cells divide and generate specialized neuronal and non-neuronal cells. to study how g2 phase arrest affects so lineage specification, we forced pi cells to divide prematurely. this produced sos with normal neuronal lineages but supernumerary non-neuronal cell types because prematurely dividing pi cells generate a secondary pi cell that produces a complete so and an external precursor cell that undergoes amplification divisions. pi cells are therefore able to undergo self-renewal before transit to a terminal mode of division. regulation of g2 phase arrest thus serves a dual role in so development: preventing progenitor self-renewal and synchronizing cell division with developmental signals. cell cycle arrest in g2 phase temporally coordinates the precursor cell proliferation potential with terminal cell fate determination to ensure formation of organs with a normal set of sensory cells. summary: during drosophila sensory organ development, g2-phase arrest serves a dual role: it prevents progenitor self-renewal and it synchronizes cell division with developmental signals. the drosophila bristle lineage is an excellent system in which to study how cell cycle and fate determination are synchronized in invariant cell lineages. in this model, five different cells arise from a single precursor cell, pi, after four asymmetric cell divisions. cell diversity is achieved by the asymmetric segregation of cell determinants, such as numb and neuralized (neur), resulting in differential activation of the notch (n) pathway. we show that down-regulation of cdc2, by over-expressing tribbles, dwee1, and dmyt1 (three negative regulators of cdc2) or by using thermo-sensitive cdc2 mutant flies, delayed pi mitosis, and altered the polarity and the number of subsequent cell divisions. these modifications were associated with a mother-daughter cell fate transformation as the pi cell acquired the identity of the secondary precursor cell, piib. this type of change in cell identity only occurred when the n signaling pathway was inactive since ectopic n signaling transformed pi to piia-progeny fate. these transformations in cell identity suggest that, although synchronized, cell cycle and fate determination are independent phenomena in the bristle lineage.
backgrounddiabetes inhibits dark adaptation and both processes alter the electroretinogram (erg) in similar ways. this study aimed to investigate the relationship between oscillatory potentials (ops) and the b-wave during dark adaptation and to determine if this relationship changes during the development of diabetes.methodstwenty-one rats were assigned to adaptation, control and diabetic groups. rats were dark adapted for periods between 20 minutes and 4 hours, and ergs recorded. diabetes was induced with streptozotocin, and ergs measured after 3, 6, 9 and 12 weeks after injection.resultsincreasing periods of dark adaptation led to a logarithmic increase in the amplitude of the b-wave and the ops. this was accompanied by a decrease in the peak times of the ops and b-wave. total op amplitude and b-wave amplitude were linearly related, allowing an empirical op constant to be developed to describe the relationship between the two parameters. diabetes led to a progressive decrease in the amplitude and increase in the peak time of all waves. the op constant decreased in a linear fashion with increasing duration of diabetes.conclusionsit is argued that op masking of the b-wave could explain previous inconsistencies in reported erg changes in diabetes and that a slowing of dark adaptation does not account for these erg changes. the report concludes that the ops and b-wave amplitudes and latencies are intimately related in the normal retina and that this correlation is lost predictably during the development of diabetes. to evaluate the effect of a long period of dark adaptation on the light-adapted electroretinogram (erg), photopic ergs were recorded before (light-adapted) and immediately after (light-readapted) 15 minutes of dark adaptation. the amplitude of the b-wave in the light-readapted erg was 48% +/- 4% of that in the light-adapted erg, and the peak time of the b-wave in the light-readapted erg was delayed by an average of 3.49 +/- 1.09 ms. segmental analysis of the b-wave showed that the last segment of the ascending limb of the b-wave (from the second oscillatory potential [op] to the peak) was attenuated the most (61% +/- 8%). in fact, the reduction in the amplitude of the last segment alone accounted for more than 60% +/- 13% of the overall reduction observed for the entire b-wave. this last segment appears to correspond to op4 in the 100- to 1000-hz recordings. the amplitude of op4 in the light-readapted erg was 56.5% +/- 10% of that in the light-adapted erg, a similar reduction to that observed for the last segment of the 1- to 1000-hz b-wave. the results strongly support the concept that the b-wave of the photopic erg may actually represent a composite of potentials whose individual contributions are best visualized when the erg is recorded with the 100- to 1000-hz bandwidth.
in 2012, the world health organization global status report on noncommunicable diseases showed that 7.4 million deaths were due to ischemic heart disease. consequently, cardiovascular disease is a significant health burden, especially when partnered with comorbidities such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. of note, these diseases can all be induced or exacerbated by diet. carbohydrates, in particular, fructose and glucose, generally form the largest part of the human diet. accumulating evidence from animal studies suggests that if large amounts of fructose are consumed either in isolation or in combination with glucose (fructose-containing sugars), myocardial susceptibility to ischemia/reperfusion (i/r) injury increases. however, the underlying mechanisms that predisposes the myocardium to i/r injury in the fructose model are not elucidated, and no single mechanistic pathway has been described. based on all available data on this topic, this review describes previously investigated mechanisms and highlights 3 main mechanistic pathways whereby fructose has shown to increase myocardial susceptibility to i/r injury. these pathways include (1) increased reactive oxygen species, resulting in reduced nitric oxide synthase and coronary flow; (2) elevated plasma fatty acids and insulin, leading to increased cardiac triglyceride content and lipotoxicity; and (3) disrupted myocardial calcium handling/homeostasis. moreover, we highlight various factors that should be taken into account when the fructose animal model is used, such as rat strain, treatment periods, and doses. we argue that failure to do so would result in erratic inferences drawn from the existing body of evidence on fructose animal models. rodents are widely used to mimic human diseases to improve understanding of the causes and progression of disease symptoms and to test potential therapeutic interventions. chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes and hypertension, together known as the metabolic syndrome, are causing increasing morbidity and mortality. to control these diseases, research in rodent models that closely mimic the changes in humans is essential. this review will examine the adequacy of the many rodent models of metabolic syndrome to mimic the causes and progression of the disease in humans. the primary criterion will be whether a rodent model initiates all of the signs, especially obesity, diabetes, hypertension and dysfunction of the heart, blood vessels, liver and kidney, primarily by diet since these are the diet-induced signs in humans with metabolic syndrome. we conclude that the model that comes closest to fulfilling this criterion is the high carbohydrate, high fat-fed male rodent.
we present a simple nearest-neighbor (nn) approach that synthesizes highfrequency photorealistic images from an “incomplete” signal such as a lowresolution image, a surface normal map, or edges. current state-of-the-art deep generative models designed for such conditional image synthesis lack two important things: (1) they are unable to generate a large set of diverse outputs, due to the mode collapse problem. (2) they are not interpretable, making it difficult to control the synthesized output. we demonstrate that nn approaches potentially address such limitations, but suffer in accuracy on small datasets. we design a simple pipeline that combines the best of both worlds: the first stage uses a convolutional neural network (cnn) to map the input to a (overly-smoothed) image, and the second stage uses a pixel-wise nearest neighbor method to map the smoothed output to multiple high-quality, high-frequency outputs in a controllable manner. importantly, pixel-wise matching allows our method to compose novel high-frequency content by cutting-and-pasting pixels from different training exemplars. we demonstrate our approach for various input modalities, and for various domains ranging from human faces, pets, shoes, and handbags. we introduce an approach that leverages surface normal predictions, along with appearance cues, to retrieve 3d models for objects depicted in 2d still images from a large cad object library. critical to the success of our approach is the ability to recover accurate surface normals for objects in the depicted scene. we introduce a skip-network model built on the pre-trained oxford vgg convolutional neural network (cnn) for surface normal prediction. our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the nyuv2 rgb-d dataset for surface normal prediction, and recovers fine object detail compared to previous methods. furthermore, we develop a two-stream network over the input image and predicted surface normals that jointly learns pose and style for cad model retrieval. when using the predicted surface normals, our two-stream network matches prior work using surface normals computed from rgb-d images on the task of pose prediction, and achieves state of the art when using rgb-d input. finally, our two-stream network allows us to retrieve cad models that better match the style and pose of a depicted object compared with baseline approaches.
most of the current boundary detection systems rely exclusively on low-level features, such as color and texture. however, perception studies suggest that humans employ object-level reasoning when judging if a particular pixel is a boundary. inspired by this observation, in this work we show how to predict boundaries by exploiting object-level features from a pretrained object-classification network. our method can be viewed as a "high-for-low" approach where high-level object features inform the low-level boundary detection process. our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on an established boundary detection benchmark and it is efficient to run. additionally, we show that due to the semantic nature of our boundaries we can use them to aid a number of high-level vision tasks. we demonstrate that using our boundaries we improve the performance of state-of-the-art methods on the problems of semantic boundary labeling, semantic segmentation and object proposal generation. we can view this process as a "low-for-high'" scheme, where low-level boundaries aid high-level vision tasks. thus, our contributions include a boundary detection system that is accurate, efficient, generalizes well to multiple datasets, and is also shown to improve existing state-of-the-art high-level vision methods on three distinct tasks. this paper proposes a conceptually simple but surprisingly powerful method which combines the effectiveness of a discriminative object detector with the explicit correspondence offered by a nearest-neighbor approach. the method is based on training a separate linear svm classifier for every exemplar in the training set. each of these exemplar-svms is thus defined by a single positive instance and millions of negatives. while each detector is quite specific to its exemplar, we empirically observe that an ensemble of such exemplar-svms offers surprisingly good generalization. our performance on the pascal voc detection task is on par with the much more complex latent part-based model of felzenszwalb et al., at only a modest computational cost increase. but the central benefit of our approach is that it creates an explicit association between each detection and a single training exemplar. because most detections show good alignment to their associated exemplar, it is possible to transfer any available exemplar meta-data (segmentation, geometric structure, 3d model, etc.) directly onto the detections, which can then be used as part of overall scene understanding.
purpose of this study was to compare different machine learning classifiers (c4.5, support vector machine, naive bayes, k-nn) in the early prediction of outcome of the subjects in vegetative state due to traumatic brain injury. accuracy proved acceptable for all compared methods (auc > 0.8), but sensitivity and specificity varied considerably and only some classifiers (in particular, support vector machine) appear applicable models in the clinical routine. a combined use of classifiers is advisable. we introduce a new accuracy index for receiver operating characteristic (roc) curves, namely the partial area under the binormal roc graph over any specified region of interest. we propose a simple but general procedure, based on a conventional analysis of variance, for comparing accuracy indices derived from two or more different modalities. the proposed method is related to and compared with existing methodology, and is illustrated by results from an experiment on optimization of density and contrast yielded by multiform photographic images used for scintigraphy.
a fundamental problem in computer vision and pattern recognition is to determine where and, most importantly, why a given technique is applicable. this is not only necessary because it helps us decide which techniques to apply at each given time. knowing why current algorithms cannot be applied facilitates the design of new algorithms robust to such problems. in this paper, we report on a theoretical study that demonstrates where and why generalized eigen-based linear equations do not work. in particular, we show that when the smallest angle between the ith eigenvector given by the metric to be maximized and the first i eigenvectors given by the metric to be minimized is close to zero, our results are not guaranteed to be correct. several properties of such models are also presented. for illustration, we concentrate on the classical applications of classification and feature extraction. we also show how we can use our findings to design more robust algorithms. we conclude with a discussion on the broader impacts of our results. we develop a face recognition algorithm which is insensitive to large variation in lighting direction and facial expression. taking a pattern classification approach, we consider each pixel in an image as a coordinate in a high-dimensional space. we take advantage of the observation that the images of a particular face, under varying illumination but fixed pose, lie in a 3d linear subspace of the high dimensional image space-if the face is a lambertian surface without shadowing. however, since faces are not truly lambertian surfaces and do indeed produce self-shadowing, images will deviate from this linear subspace. rather than explicitly modeling this deviation, we linearly project the image into a subspace in a manner which discounts those regions of the face with large deviation. our projection method is based on fisher's linear discriminant and produces well separated classes in a low-dimensional subspace, even under severe variation in lighting and facial expressions. the eigenface technique, another method based on linearly projecting the image space to a low dimensional subspace, has similar computational requirements. yet, extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed "fisherface" method has error rates that are lower than those of the eigenface technique for tests on the harvard and yale face databases.
recently, attempts to improve decision making in species management have focussed on uncertainties associated with modelling temporal fluctuations in populations. reducing model uncertainty is challenging; while larger samples improve estimation of species trajectories and reduce statistical errors, they typically amplify variability in observed trajectories. in particular, traditional modelling approaches aimed at estimating population trajectories usually do not account well for nonlinearities and uncertainties associated with multi-scale observations characteristic of large spatio-temporal surveys. we present a bayesian semi-parametric hierarchical model for simultaneously quantifying uncertainties associated with model structure and parameters, and scale-specific variability over time. we estimate uncertainty across a four-tiered spatial hierarchy of coral cover from the great barrier reef. coral variability is well described; however, our results show that, in the absence of additional model specifications, conclusions regarding coral trajectories become highly uncertain when considering multiple reefs, suggesting that management should focus more at the scale of individual reefs. the approach presented facilitates the description and estimation of population trajectories and associated uncertainties when variability cannot be attributed to specific causes and origins. we argue that our model can unlock value contained in large-scale datasets, provide guidance for understanding sources of uncertainty, and support better informed decision making. photosystem ii (psii) herbicides are used in large quantities on agricultural lands adjoining the great barrier reef (gbr). routine monitoring at 14 sites in inshore waters of the gbr using passive sampling techniques detected diuron (32-94% of sampling periods) at maximum concentrations of 1.7-430ng l(-1) in the relatively pristine cape york region to the mackay whitsunday region, respectively. a psii herbicide equivalent (psii-heq) index developed as an indicator for reporting was dominated by diuron (average contribution 89%) and typically increased during the wet season. the maximum psii-heq indicates the potential for photosynthetic inhibition of diatoms, seagrass and coral-symbionts. psii herbicides were significantly positively correlated with remotely sensed coloured dissolved organic matter, a proxy for freshwater extent. combining these methods provides for the first time the potential to cost-effectively monitor improvements in water quality entering the gbr with respect to exposure to psii herbicides.
the aim of this study was to investigate how previously inactive adults who had participated in a structured, partly supervised 6-week exercise program restructured their time budgets when the program ended. using a randomised controlled trial design, 129 previously inactive adults were recruited and randomly allocated to one of three groups: a moderate or extensive six-week physical activity intervention (150 and 300 additional minutes of exercise per week, respectively) or a control group. additional physical activity was accumulated through both group and individual exercise sessions with a wide range of activities. use of time and time spent in energy expenditure zones was measured using a computerised 24-h self-report recall instrument, the multimedia activity recall for children and adults, and accelerometry at baseline, mid- and end-program and at 3- and 6-months follow up. at final follow up, all significant changes in time use domains had returned to within 20 minutes of baseline levels (physical activity 1-2 min/d, active transport 3-9 min/d, self-care 0-2 min/d, television/videogames 13-18 min/d in the moderate and extensive group, relative to controls, respectively, p>0.05). similarly, all significant changes in time spent in the moderate energy expenditure zone had returned to within 1-3 min/d baseline levels (p>0.05), however time spent in vigorous physical activity according to accelerometry estimates remained elevated, although the changes were small in magnitude (1 min/d in the moderate and extensive groups, relative to controls, p=0.01). the results of this study demonstrate strong recidivist patterns in physical activity, but also in other aspects of time use. in designing and determining the effectiveness of exercise interventions, future studies would benefit from considering the whole profile of time use, rather than focusing on individual activities. trial registration australian new zealand clinical trials registry actrn12610000248066 measurement in behavioural epidemiology depends on high resolution and precise and accurate measures of the behaviour of interest. few questionnaires in the adult population are able to simultaneously collect the multidimensional information that is emerging as being important in the relationship between behaviour and health. this project had two objectives: (1) to develop an adult version of the computer-delivered multimedia activity recall for children and adolescents (marca), a 24-h activity recall instrument that can measure use-of-time and estimate energy expenditure and (2) to determine the test-retest reliability and convergent validity of the developed adult marca. thirty-eight healthy subjects (mean±sd, 31.7±12.1 yr) completed two recalls of the adult marca within 24-h and accelerometer counts were measured on 30 of the subjects. bland-altman analysis and intraclass correlation coefficients (icc) were used to quantify the test-retest reliability of the adult marca. spearman rank correlation coefficients (rho) were used to quantify convergent validity of the adult marca compared to accelerometer counts. the test-retest reliability coefficients of the adult marca were high with intra-class coefficients ranging from 0.99 to 1.00. moderate to strong validity was observed for physical activity level (pal) (met.min score of accelerometer wear time) and accelerometer counts per minute (rho=0.72). the adult marca is a valid and reliable self-report measure of use-of-time and energy expenditure, capable of a wide variety of flexible use-of-time analyses related to a wide range of behaviours.
purpose adolescents' physical activity levels during school break time are low and understanding correlates of physical activity and sedentary time in this context is important. this study investigated cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between a range of individual, behavioural, social and policy/organisational correlates and objectively measured school break time physical activity and sedentary time. methods in 2006, 146 adolescents (50% males; mean age = 14.1±0.6 years) completed a questionnaire and wore an accelerometer for ≥3 school days. time spent engaged in sedentary, light (lpa) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (mvpa) during school break times (recess and lunchtime) were calculated using existing cut-points. measures were repeated in 2008 among 111 adolescents. multilevel models examined cross-sectional and longitudinal associations. results bringing in equipment was cross-sectionally associated with 3.2% more mvpa during break times. females engaged in 5.1% more sedentary time than males, whilst older adolescents engaged in less mvpa than younger adolescents. few longitudinal associations were observed. adolescents who brought sports equipment to school engaged in 7.2% less lpa during break times two years later compared to those who did not bring equipment to school. conclusion these data suggest that providing equipment and reducing restrictions on bringing in sports equipment to school may promote physical activity during school recess. strategies targeting females' and older adolescents', in particular, are warranted. abstract objective: to develop an internationally acceptable definition of child overweight and obesity, specifying the measurement, the reference population, and the age and sex specific cut off points. design: international survey of six large nationally representative cross sectional growth studies. setting: brazil, great britain, hong kong, the netherlands, singapore, and the united states subjects: 97 876 males and 94 851 females from birth to 25 years of age main outcome measure: body mass index (weight/height2). results: for each of the surveys, centile curves were drawn that at age 18 years passed through the widely used cut off points of 25 and 30 kg/m2 for adult overweight and obesity. the resulting curves were averaged to provide age and sex specific cut off points from 2-18 years. conclusions: the proposed cut off points, which are less arbitrary and more internationally based than current alternatives, should help to provide internationally comparable prevalence rates of overweight and obesity in children.
analyses of phosphate and ammonium transporter mutants reveal differential requirements for these proteins during arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis depending on the plant nutrient status. during arbuscular mycorrhizal (am) symbiosis, the plant gains access to phosphate (pi) and nitrogen delivered by its fungal symbiont. transfer of mineral nutrients occurs at the interface between branched hyphae called arbuscules and root cortical cells. in medicago truncatula, a pi transporter, pt4, is required for symbiotic pi transport, and in pt4, symbiotic pi transport fails, arbuscules degenerate prematurely, and the symbiosis is not maintained. premature arbuscule degeneration (pad) is suppressed when pt4 mutants are nitrogen-deprived, possibly the result of compensation by pt8, a second am-induced pi transporter. however, pad is also suppressed in nitrogen-starved pt4 pt8 double mutants, negating this hypothesis and furthermore indicating that in this condition, neither of these symbiotic pi transporters is required for symbiosis. in m. truncatula, three amt2 family ammonium transporters are induced during am symbiosis. to test the hypothesis that suppression of pad involves amt2 transporters, we analyzed double and triple pi and ammonium transporter mutants. atm2;3 but not amt2;4 was required for suppression of pad in pt4, while amt2;4, but not amt2;3, complemented growth of a yeast ammonium transporter mutant. in summary, arbuscule life span is influenced by pt4 and atm2;3, and their relative importance varies with the nitrogen status of the plant. arbuscular mycorrhizal (am) symbiosis is a widespread mutualism formed between vascular plants and fungi of the glomeromycota. in this endosymbiosis, fungal hyphae enter the roots, growing through epidermal cells to the cortex where they establish differentiated hyphae called arbuscules in the cortical cells. reprogramming of the plant epidermal and cortical cells occurs to enable intracellular growth of the fungal symbiont; however, the plant genes underlying this process are largely unknown. here, through the use of rnai, we demonstrate that the expression of a medicago truncatula gene named vapyrin is essential for arbuscule formation, and also for efficient epidermal penetration by am fungi. vapyrin is induced transiently in the epidermis coincident with hyphal penetration, and then in the cortex during arbuscule formation. the vapyrin protein is cytoplasmic, and in cells containing am fungal hyphae, the protein accumulates in small puncta that move through the cytoplasm. vapyrin is a novel protein composed of two domains that mediate protein-protein interactions: an n-terminal vamp-associated protein (vap)/major sperm protein (msp) domain and a c-terminal ankyrin-repeat domain. putative vapyrin orthologs exist widely in the plant kingdom, but not in arabidopsis, or in non-plant species. the data suggest a role for vapyrin in cellular remodeling to support the intracellular development of fungal hyphae during am symbiosis.
sea quark distributions in the nucleon have naively been expected to be generated perturbatively by gluon splitting in this case there is no reason for the light quark and anti quark sea distributions to be di erent no asymmetries in the strange or heavy quark sea distributions are predicted in the improved parton model however recent experiments have called these naive expectations into question a violation of the gottfried sum rule has been measured in several experiments suggesting that u d in the proton additionally other measurements while not de nitive show that there may be an asymmetry in the strange and anti strange quark sea distributions these e ects may require nonperturbative explanations in this review we rst discuss the perturbative aspects of the sea quark distributions we then describe the experiments that could point to nonperturbative contributions to the nucleon sea current phenomenological models that could explain some of these e ects are reviewed strange matrix elements of the nucleon are calculated within the light-cone formulation of the meson cloud model. the q{sup 2} dependence of the strange vector and axial vector form factors is computed, and the strangeness radius and magnetic moment extracted, both of which are found to be very small and slightly negative. within the same framework one finds a small but nonzero excess of the antistrange distribution over the strange at large x. kaon loops are unlikely, however, to be the source of a large polarized strange quark distribution. {copyright} {ital 1997} {ital the american physical society}
an increasing number of automated models can make inferences about learners’ understanding based on their problem solving choices in interactive educational technologies. one potential use of these models is to personalize feedback interventions. we investigate using the output of an inverse planning model to choose feedback activities for learners. the inverse planning model uses the patterns of how a learner solves algebraic equations to estimate her proficiency on several discrete skills. the personalized feedback then focuses on the skill which is least proficient and includes a combination of existing educational content and scaffolded practice. we experimentally tested the effectiveness of personalizing the feedback based on the algorithm’s estimate compared to simply providing a random feedback activity. the results show that completing the feedback was associated with performance improvements from preto post-test, but that personalized feedback was not associated with reliably more improvement. however, participants who received feedback about a skill that was far from mastery did show reliably more improvement than those who received feedback about an already-mastered skill. this suggests that there is potential in using the inverse planning algorithm to provide more effective learning experiences. watching another person take actions to complete a goal and making inferences about that person's knowledge is a relatively natural task for people. this ability can be especially important in educational settings, where the inferences can be used for assessment, diagnosing misconceptions, and providing informative feedback. in this paper, we develop a general framework for automatically making such inferences based on observed actions; this framework is particularly relevant for inferring student knowledge in educational games and other interactive virtual environments. our approach relies on modeling action planning: we formalize the problem as a markov decision process in which one must choose what actions to take to complete a goal, where choices will be dependent on one's beliefs about how actions affect the environment. we use a variation of inverse reinforcement learning to infer these beliefs. through two lab experiments, we show that this model can recover people's beliefs in a simple environment, with accuracy comparable to that of human observers. we then demonstrate that the model can be used to provide real-time feedback and to model data from an existing educational game.
research and valid practice in emotional intelligence (ei) have been impeded by lack of theoretical clarity regarding (a) the relative roles of emotion perception, emotion understanding, and emotion regulation facets in explaining job performance; (b) conceptual redundancy of ei with cognitive intelligence and big five personality; and (c) application of the ei label to 2 distinct sets of constructs (i.e., ability-based ei and mixed-based ei). in the current article, the authors propose and then test a theoretical model that integrates these factors. they specify a progressive (cascading) pattern among ability-based ei facets, in which emotion perception must causally precede emotion understanding, which in turn precedes conscious emotion regulation and job performance. the sequential elements in this progressive model are believed to selectively reflect conscientiousness, cognitive ability, and neuroticism, respectively. "mixed-based" measures of ei are expected to explain variance in job performance beyond cognitive ability and personality. the cascading model of ei is empirically confirmed via meta-analytic data, although relationships between ability-based ei and job performance are shown to be inconsistent (i.e., ei positively predicts performance for high emotional labor jobs and negatively predicts performance for low emotional labor jobs). gender and race differences in ei are also meta-analyzed. implications for linking the ei fad in personnel selection to established psychological theory are discussed. a common research problem is the estimation of the population correlation between x and y from an observed correlation rxy obtained from a sample that has been restricted because of some sample selection process. methods of correcting sample correlations for range restriction in a limited set of conditions are well-known. an expanded classification scheme for range-restriction scenarios is developed that conceptualizes range-restriction scenarios from various combinations of the following facets: (a) the variable(s) on which selection occurs (x, y and/or a 3rd variable z), (b) whether unrestricted variances for the relevant variables are known, and (c) whether a 3rd variable, if involved, is measured or unmeasured. on the basis of these facets, the authors describe potential solutions for 11 different range-restriction scenarios and summarize research to date on these techniques.
backgroundthe reliability and reproducibility of experimental procedures is a cornerstone of scientific practice. there is a pressing technological need for the better representation of biomedical protocols to enable other agents (human or machine) to better reproduce results. a framework that ensures that all information required for the replication of experimental protocols is essential to achieve reproducibility.methodswe have developed the ontology exact2 (experimental actions) that is designed to capture the full semantics of biomedical protocols required for their reproducibility.to construct exact2 we manually inspected hundreds of published and commercial biomedical protocols from several areas of biomedicine. after establishing a clear pattern for extracting the required information we utilized text-mining tools to translate the protocols into a machine amenable format. we have verified the utility of exact2 through the successful processing of previously 'unseen' (not used for the construction of exact2) protocols.resultsthe paper reports on a fundamentally new version exact2 that supports the semantically-defined representation of biomedical protocols. the ability of exact2 to capture the semantics of biomedical procedures was verified through a text mining use case. in this exact2 is used as a reference model for text mining tools to identify terms pertinent to experimental actions, and their properties, in biomedical protocols expressed in natural language. an exact2-based framework for the translation of biomedical protocols to a machine amenable format is proposed.conclusionsthe exact2 ontology is sufficient to record, in a machine processable form, the essential information about biomedical protocols. exact2 defines explicit semantics of experimental actions, and can be used by various computer applications. it can serve as a reference model for for the translation of biomedical protocols in natural language into a semantically-defined format. motivation: many published manuscripts contain experiment protocols which are poorly described or deficient in information. this means that the published results are very hard or impossible to repeat. this problem is being made worse by the increasing complexity of high-throughput/automated methods. there is therefore a growing need to represent experiment protocols in an efficient and unambiguous way. results: we have developed the experiment actions (exact) ontology as the basis of a method of representing biological laboratory protocols. we provide example protocols that have been formalized using exact, and demonstrate the advantages and opportunities created by using this formalization. we argue that the use of exact will result in the publication of protocols with increased clarity and usefulness to the scientific community. availability: the ontology, examples and code can be downloaded from http://www.aber.ac.uk/compsci/research/bio/dss/exact/ contact: larisa soldatova lss@aber.ac.uk
the byte-addressable non-volatile memory (nvm) is a promising medium for data storage. nvm-oriented file systems have been designed to explore nvm's performance potential. meanwhile, applications may write considerable duplicate data. for nvm, a removal of duplicate data can promote space efficiency, improve write endurance, and potentially improve the performance by avoidance of repeatedly writing the same data. however, we have observed severe performance degradations when implementing a state-of-the-art inline deduplication algorithm in an nvm-oriented file system. a quantitative analysis reveals that, with nvm, 1) the conventional way to manage deduplication metadata for block devices, particularly in light of consistency, is inefficient, and, 2) the performance with deduplication becomes more subject to fingerprint calculations. we hence propose a deduplication algorithm called <italic>nv-dedup </italic>. nv-dedup manages deduplication metadata in a fine-grained, cpu and nvm-favored way, and preserves the metadata consistency with a lightweight transactional scheme. it also does workload-adaptive fingerprinting based on an analytical model and a transition scheme among fingerprinting methods to reduce calculation penalties. we have built a prototype of nv-dedup in the persistent memory file system (pmfs). experiments show that, nv-dedup not only substantially saves nvm space, but also boosts the performance of pmfs by up to 2.1<inline-formula> <tex-math notation="latex">$\times$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="wang-ieq1-2774270.gif"/> </alternatives></inline-formula>. next-generation non-volatile memories (nvms) promise dram-like performance, persistence, and high density. they can attach directly to processors to form non-volatile main memory (nvmm) and offer the opportunity to build very low-latency storage systems. these high-performance storage systems would be especially useful in large-scale data center environments where reliability and availability are critical. however, providing reliability and availability to nvmm is challenging, since the latency of data replication can overwhelm the low latency that nvmm should provide. we propose mojim, a system that provides the reliability and availability that large-scale storage systems require, while preserving the performance of nvmm. mojim achieves these goals by using a two-tier architecture in which the primary tier contains a mirrored pair of nodes and the secondary tier contains one or more secondary backup nodes with weakly consistent copies of data. mojim uses highly-optimized replication protocols, software, and networking stacks to minimize replication costs and expose as much of nvmm?s performance as possible. we evaluate mojim using raw dram as a proxy for nvmm and using an industrial nvmm emulation system. we find that mojim provides replicated nvmm with similar or even better performance than un-replicated nvmm (reducing latency by 27% to 63% and delivering between 0.4 to 2.7x the throughput). we demonstrate that replacing mongodb's built-in replication system with mojim improves mongodb's performance by 3.4 to 4x.
at present, infections with bovine viral diarrhea virus (bvdv) type 2 occur nearly as frequently as those with bvdv type 1, so development of vaccines that protect cattle from both type 1 and type 2 bvdv has become critical. in this study, we compared various dna prime-protein boost vaccination strategies to protect cattle from challenge with bvdv-2 using the major protective antigen of bvdv, glycoprotein e2. calves were immunized with a plasmid encoding either type 1 e2 (e2.1) or type 2 e2 (e2.2) or with both plasmids (e2.1+e2.2). this was followed by a heterologous boost with e2.1, e2.2 or e2.1 and e2.2 protein formulated with emulsigen and a cpg oligodeoxynucleotide. subsequently, the calves were challenged with bvdv-2 strain 1373. all vaccinated calves developed both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, including virus-neutralizing antibodies and ifn-gamma-secreting cells in the peripheral blood. depletion studies showed that cd4+ t cells were responsible for ifn-gamma production. furthermore, the calves vaccinated with either the e2.2 or the e2.1+e2.2 vaccines were very well protected from challenge with bvdv-2, having little leukopenia and showing no weight loss or temperature response. in addition, the animals vaccinated with the e2.1 vaccine were partially protected, so there was a certain level of cross-protection. these data demonstrate that a vaccination strategy consisting of priming with e2.2 or e2.1+e2.2 dna and boosting with e2.2 or e2.1+e2.2 protein fully protects cattle from bvdv-2 challenge. the immunogenicity of a poylvalent hiv-1 vaccine comprised of env antigens from primary r5 isolates was evaluated in rhesus macaques. dna vaccines encoding four env antigens from multiple hiv-1 subtypes and hiv-1 gag antigen from a single subtype elicited a persistent level of binding antibodies to gp120 from multiple hiv-1 isolates that were markedly enhanced following boosting with homologous gp120 proteins in qs-21 adjuvant irrespective of the route of dna immunization. these sera neutralized homologous and, to a lesser degree, heterologous hiv-1 isolates. four of the six immunized animals were completely protected following rectal challenge with a shiv encoding env from hiv-1(ba-l), whereas the virus load was reduced in the remaining animals compared to naïve controls. hence priming with dna encoding env antigens from multiple hiv-1 clades followed by boosting with homologous env proteins elicits anti-hiv-1 immune responses capable of protecting macaques against mucosal transmission of r5 tropic shiv isolate.
backgroundin addition to their cytotoxic nature, reactive oxygen species (ros) are also signal molecules in diverse cellular processes in eukaryotic organisms. linking genome-wide transcriptional changes to cellular physiology in oxidative stress-exposed aspergillus nidulans cultures provides the opportunity to estimate the sizes of peroxide (o22-), superoxide (o2•-) and glutathione/glutathione disulphide (gsh/gssg) redox imbalance responses.resultsgenome-wide transcriptional changes triggered by diamide, h2o2 and menadione in a. nidulans vegetative tissues were recorded using dna microarrays containing 3533 unique pcr-amplified probes. evaluation of loess-normalized data indicated that 2499 gene probes were affected by at least one stress-inducing agent. the stress induced by diamide and h2o2 were pulse-like, with recovery after 1 h exposure time while no recovery was observed with menadione. the distribution of stress-responsive gene probes among major physiological functional categories was approximately the same for each agent. the gene group sizes solely responsive to changes in intracellular o22-, o2•- concentrations or to gsh/gssg redox imbalance were estimated at 7.7, 32.6 and 13.0 %, respectively. gene groups responsive to diamide, h2o2 and menadione treatments and gene groups influenced by gsh/gssg, o22- and o2•- were only partly overlapping with distinct enrichment profiles within functional categories. changes in the gsh/gssg redox state influenced expression of genes coding for pbs2 like mapk kinase homologue, psk2 kinase homologue, atfa transcription factor, and many elements of ubiquitin tagging, cell division cycle regulators, translation machinery proteins, defense and stress proteins, transport proteins as well as many enzymes of the primary and secondary metabolisms. meanwhile, a separate set of genes encoding transport proteins, cpca and jlba amino acid starvation-responsive transcription factors, and some elements of sexual development and sporulation was ros responsive.conclusionthe existence of separate o22-, o2•- and gsh/gssg responsive gene groups in a eukaryotic genome has been demonstrated. oxidant-triggered, genome-wide transcriptional changes should be analyzed considering changes in oxidative stress-responsive physiological conditions and not correlating them directly to the chemistry and concentrations of the oxidative stress-inducing agent. this report describes a new method for simultaneous isolation of rna, dna and proteins from cell and tissue samples. the method is based on the use of a reagent containing phenol and guanidine thiocyanate. a biological sample is homogenized in the reagent and the simultaneous isolation of rna, dna and proteins is accomplished in a single step by a liquid-phase separation. the isolation of rna can be completed in about 1 h, and dna and proteins in about 3 h. the simultaneously isolated rna, dna and proteins are ready for northern, southern and western blotting. the complete recovery of dna from samples used for the rna and protein isolation makes it possible to normalize the results of gene expression studies based on dna content instead of on the more variable total rna, protein content or tissue weight.
intestinal epithelial cell damage is frequently seen in the mucosal lesions of infectious or inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis or crohn's disease. complete remission of these diseases requires both the disappearance of inflammation and the repair of damaged epithelium. saccharomyces boulardii (sb, biocodex) is a non-pathogenic yeast widely used as a preventive and therapeutic probiotic for the prevention and treatment of diarrhea and other gastrointestinal disorders. we recently showed that it enhances the repair of intestinal epithelium through activation of α2β1 integrin collagen receptors. in the present study, we demonstrated that α2β1 integrin is not the sole cell-extracellular matrix receptor involved during sb-mediated intestinal restitution. indeed, by using cell adhesion assays, we showed that sb supernatant contains heat sensitive molecule(s), with a molecular weight higher than 9 kda, which decreased αvβ5 integrin-mediated adhesion to vitronectin by competing with the integrin. moreover, sb-mediated changes in cell adhesion to vitronectin resulted in a reduction of the αvβ5signaling pathway. we used a monolayer wounding assay that mimics in vivo cell restitution to demonstrate that down-modulation of the αvβ5 integrin-vitronectin interaction is related to sb-induced cell migration. we therefore postulated that sb supernatant contains motogenic factors that enhance cell restitution through multiple pathways, including the dynamic fine regulation of αvβ5 integrin binding activity. this could be of major importance in diseases characterized by severe mucosal injury, such as inflammatory and infectious bowel diseases. crosstalk between integrins is involved in the regulation of various cell functions including cell migration. here we identify the interplay between the integrins alphavbeta5/beta6 and alpha2beta1 during cell migration toward type i collagen. human colon cancer cell lines ht29-d4 and sw480 were used as cell models. to improve our understanding of the consequences of alphavbeta5/beta6 function on alpha2beta1, we decreased the expression of alphav integrins by either sirna or lysosomal targeting strategies or inhibited their function using, as antagonists, blocking antibodies or disintegrins. in all cases, we observed a greatly enhanced alpha2beta1 integrin-dependent cell migration associated with focal adhesion rearrangements and increased outside-in signaling as demonstrated by elevated phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and mapkinase (erk1 and erk2). the alphavbeta5/beta6-dependent limitation of alpha2beta1 function could be overridden by ts2/16, an activating anti-beta1 antibody. interestingly, compared to control cells, the pharmacological inhibition of pi3kinase or the sirna-mediated knockdown of akt had little effect on the high alpha2beta1-mediated cell migration observed in the absence of alphav integrins or following activation of alpha2beta1 integrins by the ts2/16. these results suggest that integrins alphavbeta5/beta6 repress alpha2beta1 possibly by interfering with their activation process and thereby modify the cell signaling regulation of alpha2beta1-mediated migration.
cutaneous leishmaniasis has various outcomes, ranging from self-healing reddened papules to extensive open ulcerations that metastasise to secondary sites and are often resistant to standard therapies. in the case of l. guyanensis (l.g), about 5–10% of all infections result in metastatic complications. we recently showed that a cytoplasmic virus within l.g parasites (lrv1) is able to act as a potent innate immunogen, worsening disease outcome in a murine model. in this study, we investigated the immunophenotype of human patients infected by l.g and found a significant association between the inflammatory cytokine il-17a, the presence of lrv1 and disease chronicity. further, il-17a was inversely correlated to the protective cytokine ifn-γ. these findings were experimentally corroborated in our murine model, where il-17a produced in lrv1+ l.g infection contributed to parasite virulence and dissemination in the absence of ifn-γ. additionally, il-17a inhibition in mice using digoxin or sr1001, showed therapeutic promise in limiting parasite virulence. thus, this murine model of lrv1-dependent infectious metastasis validated markers of disease chronicity in humans and elucidated the immunologic mechanism for the dissemination of leishmania parasites to secondary sites. moreover, it confirms the prognostic value of lrv1 and il-17a detection to prevent metastatic leishmaniasis in human patients. rna interference (rnai) pathways are widespread in metaozoans but the genes required show variable occurrence or activity in eukaryotic microbes, including many pathogens. while some leishmania lack rnai activity and argonaute or dicer genes, we show that leishmania braziliensis and other species within the leishmania subgenus viannia elaborate active rnai machinery. strong attenuation of expression from a variety of reporter and endogenous genes was seen. as expected, rnai knockdowns of the sole argonaute gene implicated this protein in rnai. the potential for functional genetics was established by testing rnai knockdown lines lacking the paraflagellar rod, a key component of the parasite flagellum. this sets the stage for the systematic manipulation of gene expression through rnai in these predominantly diploid asexual organisms, and may also allow selective rnai-based chemotherapy. functional evolutionary surveys of rnai genes established that rnai activity was lost after the separation of the leishmania subgenus viannia from the remaining leishmania species, a divergence associated with profound changes in the parasite infectious cycle and virulence. the genus leishmania therefore offers an accessible system for testing hypothesis about forces that may select for the loss of rnai during evolution, such as invasion by viruses, changes in genome plasticity mediated by transposable elements and gene amplification (including those mediating drug resistance), and/or alterations in parasite virulence.
enhancement of sugar content and sweetness is desirable in some vegetables and in almost all fruits; however, biotechnological methods to increase sugar content are limited. here, a completely novel methodological approach is presented that produces sweeter tomato fruits but does not have any negative effects on plant growth. sucrose-induced repression of translation (sirt), which is mediated by upstream open reading frames (uorfs), was initially reported in arabidopsis atbzip11, a class s basic region leucine zipper (bzip) transcription factor gene. here, two atbzip11 orthologous genes, slbzip1 and slbzip2, were identified in tomato (solanum lycopersicum). slbzip1 and slbzip2 contained four and three uorfs, respectively, in the cdna 5'-leader regions. the second uorfs from the 5' cdna end were conserved and involved in sirt. tomato plants were transformed with binary vectors in which only the main open reading frames (orfs) of slbzip1 and slbzip2, without the sirt-responsive uorfs, were placed under the control of the fruit-specific e8 promoter. growth and morphology of the resulting transgenic tomato plants were comparable to those of wild-type plants. transgenic fruits were approximately 1.5-fold higher in sugar content (sucrose/glucose/fructose) than nontransgenic tomato fruits. in addition, the levels of several amino acids, such as asparagine and glutamine, were higher in transgenic fruits than in wild-type fruits. this was expected because slbzip transactivates the asparagine synthase and proline dehydrogenase genes. this 'sweetening' technology is broadly applicable to other plants that utilize sucrose as a major translocation sugar. the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) has revolutionised the rapid analysis of mammalian genomic dna (1). however, pcr is less useful in the analysis of plant dna due to the difficulties in extracting nucleic acids from limited amounts of plant tissue. we have developed a method for the rapid extraction of small amounts of plant genomic dna suitable for pcr analysis. the method is applicable to a variety of plant species and has the added advantage of not requiring any phenol or chloroform extraction. thus it is possible to complete an extraction within 15 minutes without handling any hazardous organic solvents. samples for pcr analysis (usually leaf tissue) are collected using the lid of a sterile eppendorf tube to pinch out a disc of material into the tube. this ensures uniform sample size and also reduces the possibilities of contamination arising from handling the tissue. dna is extracted as follows: the tissue is macerated (using disposable grinders from bel-art products: scienceware, pequannock, nj, 07440 usa. catalog no 992) in the original eppendorf tube at room temperature, without buffer, for 15 seconds. 400 yl of extraction buffer (200 mm tris hc1 ph 7.5, 250 mm nacl, 25 mm edta, 0.5% sds) is added and the sample vortexed for 5 seconds. this mixture can then be left at room temperature until all the samples have been extracted (> 1 hour). the extracts are centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 1 minute and 300 y\ of the supernatant transferred to a fresh eppendorf tube. this supernatant is mixed with 300 /il isopropanol and left at room temperature for 2 minutes. following centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 minutes, the pellet is vacuum dried and dissolved in 100 /xl 1xte. this dna is stable at 4°c for greater than one year. 2.5 yx of this sample is sufficient for a standard 50 y\ pcr (figure 1). when older tissue is used this may be increased to 25 /xl without any deleterious effect on the pcr. using this protocol we have found it possible to process hundreds of individual samples in a single working day.
objective the aim of this systematic review was to determine the validity and inter- and intra-observer reliability of the assessment of knee joint effusion in osteoarthritis (oa) of the knee. methods medline, web of knowledge, cinahl, embase, and amed were searched from their inception to february 2015. articles were included according to a priori defined criteria: samples containing participants with knee oa; prospective evaluation of clinical tests and assessments of knee effusion that included reliability, sensitivity, and specificity of these tests. results a total of 10 publications were reviewed. eight of these considered reliability and four on validity of clinical assessments against ultrasound effusion. it was not possible to undertake a meta-analysis of reliability or validity because of differences in study designs and the clinical tests. intra-observer kappa agreement for visible swelling ranged from 0.37 (suprapatellar) to 1.0 (prepatellar); for bulge sign 0.47 and balloon sign 0.37. inter-observer kappa agreement for visible swelling ranged from −0.02 (prepatellar) to 0.65 (infrapatellar), the balloon sign −0.11 to 0.82, patellar tap −0.02 to 0.75 and bulge sign kappa −0.04 to 0.14 or reliability coefficient 0.97. reliability and diagnostic accuracy tended to be better in experienced observers. very few data looked at performance of individual clinical tests with sensitivity ranging 18.2–85.7% and specificity 35.3–93.3%, both higher with larger effusions. conclusion the majority of unstandardized clinical tests to assess joint effusion in knee oa had relatively low intra- and inter-observer reliability. there is some evidence experience improved reliability and diagnostic accuracy of tests. currently there is insufficient evidence to recommend any particular test in clinical practice. objectives: to assess the prevalence of inflammation in subjects with chronic painful knee osteoarthritis (oa), as determined by the presence of synovitis or joint effusion at ultrasonography (us); and to evaluate the correlation between synovitis, effusion, and clinical parameters. methods: a cross sectional, multicentre, european study was conducted under the umbrella of eular-escisit. subjects had primary chronic knee oa (acr criteria) with pain during physical activity ⩾30 mm for at least 48 hours. clinical parameters were collected by a rheumatologist and an us examination of the painful knee was performed by a radiologist or rheumatologist within 72 hours of the clinical examination. ultrasonographic synovitis was defined as synovial thickness ⩾4 mm and diffuse or nodular appearance, and a joint effusion was defined as effusion depth ⩾4 mm. results: 600 patients with painful knee oa were analysed. at us 16 (2.7%) had synovitis alone, 85 (14.2%) had both synovitis and effusion, 177 (29.5%) had joint effusion alone, and 322 (53.7%) had no inflammation according to the definitions employed. multivariate analysis showed that inflammation seen by us correlated statistically with advanced radiographic disease (kellgren-lawrence grade ⩾3; odds ratio (or) = 2.20 and 1.91 for synovitis and joint effusion, respectively), and with clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of an inflammatory “flare”, such as joint effusion on clinical examination (or = 1.97 and 2.70 for synovitis and joint effusion, respectively) or sudden aggravation of knee pain (or = 1.77 for joint effusion). conclusion: us can detect synovial inflammation and effusion in painful knee oa, which correlate significantly with knee synovitis, effusion, and clinical parameters suggestive of an inflammatory “flare”.
distributed differential privacy and applications we propose a general purpose runtime framework to secure timing channels. our technique supports higher-order function invocations and computations looping on secret data, features which none of the existing approaches fully allow. we provably eliminate external and internal timing channels in both sequential and concurrent settings, in presence of deterministic as well as nondeterministic schedulers. there is a price to be paid, however – the high computation may have to be disrupted; the low computation is nevertheless guaranteed to be unaffected. we illustrate how our approach can be realized on standard computing platforms.
backgroundthe majority of propulsive forces in swimming are produced from the upper body, with strong correlations between upper body strength and sprint performance. there are significant gaps in the literature relating to the impact of resistance training on swimming performance, specifically the transfer to swimming performance.objectivethe aims of this systematic literature review are to (1) explore the transfer of resistance-training modalities to swimming performance, and (2) examine the effects of resistance training on technical aspects of swimming.methodsfour online databases were searched with the following inclusion criteria: (1) journal articles with outcome measures related to swimming performance, and (2) competitive swimmers participating in a structured resistance-training programme. exclusion criteria were (1) participants with a mean age <16 years; (2) untrained, novice, masters and paraplegic swimmers; (3) triathletes and waterpolo players; (4) swimmers with injuries or illness; and (5) studies of starts and turns specifically. data were extracted using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (prisma) guidelines, and the physiotherapy evidence database (pedro) scale was applied.resultsfor optimal transfer, specific, low-volume, high-velocity/force resistance-training programmes are optimal. stroke length is best achieved through resistance training with low repetitions at a high velocity/force. resisted swims are the most appropriate training modality for improving stroke rate.conclusionfuture research is needed with respect to the effects of long-term resistance-training interventions on both technical parameters of swimming and overall swimming performance. the results of such work will be highly informative for the scientific community, coaches and athletes. abstract dragunas, aj, dickey, jp, and nolte, vw. the effect of drag suit training on 50 m freestyle performance. j strength cond res 26(4): 989–994, 2012—little research has evaluated the effects of drag suit training in swimming; these effects need to be explored further to optimize their use in training. for this 5-week training study, 18 subjects were divided evenly into 2 groups: control group and drag suit–trained group. both groups performed weekly training routines that included 3 sprint sets. these sprint sets were performed by both the groups; however, the drag suit training group wore the drag suit, and the control group wore their typical training attire. we evaluated the swimmers' 50-m performance using a test set of six 50-m sprints on a 10-minute interval before and after the training program. the test set was performed twice (on 2 different days) where the swimmers were tested once in the drag suit and once in their regular training attire; the order of testing was randomized. final time, stroke rate, and distance per stroke were collected. we observed that the drag suit–trained group exhibited a statistically significant decrease in distance per stoke while wearing the drag suit and the control group showed a significant increase in stroke rate and decrease in distance per stroke (in both suits). it is suggested to include some amounts of drag suit training in periods where swimming volume may decrease. sets that are short in distance and performed at high intensity with sufficient rest to allow swimmers to maintain high stroke integrity should help athletes maintain techniques. we suggest incorporating the drag suit into the training regimen and should be considered a valuable resistive training device for swimming.
background and purpose the peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor (ppar)δ has been considered a therapeutic target for diabetes and obesity through enhancement of fatty acid oxidation. the present study aimed to characterize the effects of pparδ agonists during insulin resistance of the whole body, muscle and liver. in this study, we defined the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta/delta (ppardelta) in metabolic homeostasis by using subtype selective agonists. analysis of rat l6 myotubes treated with the ppardelta subtype-selective agonist, gw501516, by the affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays revealed that ppardelta controls fatty acid oxidation by regulating genes involved in fatty acid transport, beta-oxidation, and mitochondrial respiration. similar ppardelta-mediated gene activation was observed in the skeletal muscle of gw501516-treated mice. accordingly, gw501516 treatment induced fatty acid beta-oxidation in l6 myotubes as well as in mouse skeletal muscles. administration of gw501516 to mice fed a high-fat diet ameliorated diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance, an effect accompanied by enhanced metabolic rate and fatty acid beta-oxidation, proliferation of mitochondria, and a marked reduction of lipid droplets in skeletal muscles. despite a modest body weight change relative to vehicle-treated mice, gw501516 treatment also markedly improved diabetes as revealed by the decrease in plasma glucose and blood insulin levels in genetically obese ob/ob mice. these data suggest that ppardelta is pivotal to control the program for fatty acid oxidation in the skeletal muscle, thereby ameliorating obesity and insulin resistance through its activation in obese animals.
site-specific recombinases have been used for two decades to manipulate the structure of animal genomes in highly predictable ways and have become major research tools. however, the small number of recombinases demonstrated to have distinct specificities, low toxicity, and sufficient activity to drive reactions to completion in animals has been a limitation. in this report we show that four recombinases derived from yeast—kd, b2, b3, and r—are highly active and nontoxic in drosophila and that kd, b2, b3, and the widely used flp recombinase have distinct target specificities. we also show that the kd and b3 recombinases are active in mice. a new member of the 2-micron family of plasmids, named ptd1, was found in the yeast torulaspora delbrueckii, a widespread yeast associated with food. nucleotide sequences revealed the presence of a pair of inverted repeats and three open reading frames, one of which is a homologue of the flp recombinase gene of 2-micron plasmid. an ars region was identified, by replication in saccharomyces cerevisiae and t. delbrueckii, near one of the inverted repeats. by the use of ptd1 derivatives and auxotrophic mutant hosts an efficient host-vector system was established for t. delbrueckii. so far, the 2-micron family of plasmids is restricted to four closely related genera (q6 group): saccharomyces, zygosaccharomyces, kluyveromyces, and torulaspora. after a survey of 2500 strains belonging to about 500 species (80 genera) of yeast, no circular plasmids were found in other genera.
streptococcus agalactiae is a major pathogen of neonates and immunocompromised adults. prior studies have demonstrated that, beyond the neonatal period, s. agalactiae rarely causes invasive infections in children. however, during 2004-2005, s. agalactiae was the causative agent of 60 meningitis episodes in children aged 3 months to 12 years from angola. to identify and study the specific causative genetic lineages of s. agalactiae childhood meningitis, which lack characterization to date, we conducted an extensive molecular analysis of the recovered isolates (n = 21). this constitutes what we believe to be the first molecular study of the population structure of invasive s. agalactiae isolates from africa. a low genetic diversity was observed among the isolates, where the majority belonged to clonal complex (cc) 17 presenting the capsular subtype iii-2 (86 % of cases) and marked by the intron group ii gbsi1, which has previously been observed to be associated with neonatal hosts. the predominance of single-locus variants of sequence type (st) 17 suggested the local diversification of this hypervirulent clone, which displayed novel alleles of the fbsb and sip virulence genes. the absence of the scpb-lmb region in two s. agalactiae isolates with the ia/st23 genotype is more typical of cattle than human isolates. globally, these data provide novel information about the enhanced invasiveness of the cc17 genetic lineage in older children and suggest the local diversification of this clone, which may be related to the future emergence of a novel epidemic clone in angola. transmission of group b streptococcus (gbs) from mothers to neonates during childbirth is a leading cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis. although subtyping tools have identified specific gbs phylogenetic lineages that are important in neonatal disease, little is known about the genetic diversity of these lineages or the roles that recombination and selection play in the generation of emergent genotypes. here, we examined genetic variation, selection, and recombination in seven multilocus sequence typing (mlst) loci from 94 invasive, colonizing, and bovine strains representing 38 gbs sequence types and performed dna sequencing and pcr-based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of several putative virulence genes to identify gene content differences between genotypes. despite the low level of diversity in the mlst loci, a neighbor net analysis revealed a variable range of genetic exchange among the seven clonal complexes (ccs) identified, suggesting that recombination is partly responsible for the diversity observed between genotypes. recombination is also important for several virulence genes, as some gene alleles had evidence for lateral gene exchange across divergent genotypes. the cc-17 lineage, which is associated with neonatal disease, is relatively homogeneous and therefore appears to have diverged independently with an exclusive set of virulence characteristics. these data suggest that different gbs genetic backgrounds have distinct virulence gene profiles that may be important for disease pathogenesis. such profiles could be used as markers for the rapid detection of strains with an increased propensity to cause neonatal disease and may be considered useful vaccine targets.
coronary heart disease can be diagnosed by assessing the regional motion of the heart walls in ultrasound images of the left ventricle. even for experts, ultrasound images are difficult to interpret leading to high intra-observer variability. previous work indicates that in order to approach this problem, the interactions between the different heart regions and their overall influence on the clinical condition of the heart need to be considered. to do this, we propose a method for jointly learning the structure and parameters of conditional random fields, formulating these tasks as a convex optimization problem. we consider block-l1 regularization for each set of features associated with an edge, and formalize an efficient projection method to find the globally optimal penalized maximum likelihood solution. we perform extensive numerical experiments comparing the presented method with related methods that approach the structure learning problem differently. we verify the robustness of our method on echocardiograms collected in routine clinical practice at one hospital. coronary heart disease can be diagnosed by measuring and scoring regional motion of the heart wall in ultrasound images of the left ventricle (lv) of the heart. we describe a completely automated and robust technique that detects diseased hearts based on detection and automatic tracking of the endocardium and epicardium of the lv. the local wall regions and the entire heart are then classified as normal or abnormal based on the regional and global lv wall motion. in order to leverage structural information about the heart we applied bayesian networks to this problem, and learned the relations among the wall regions off of the data using a structure learning algorithm. we checked the validity of the obtained structure using anatomical knowledge of the heart and medical rules as described by doctors. the resultant bayesian network classifier depends only on a small subset of numerical features extracted from dual-contours tracked through time and selected using a filter-based approach. our numerical results confirm that our system is robust and accurate on echocardiograms collected in routine clinical practice at one hospital; our system is built to be used in real-time.
background appropriate patient selection is needed for targeted therapies that are efficacious only in patients with specific genetic alterations. we aimed to define subgroups of patients with candidate driver genes in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. methods patients with primary lung cancer who underwent clinical genetic tests at guangdong general hospital were enrolled. driver genes were detected by sequencing, high-resolution melt analysis, qpcr, or multiple pcr and race methods. results 524 patients were enrolled in this study, and the differences in driver gene alterations among subgroups were analyzed based on histology and smoking status. in a subgroup of non-smokers with adenocarcinoma, egfr was the most frequently altered gene, with a mutation rate of 49.8%, followed by eml4-alk (9.3%), pten (9.1%), pik3ca (5.2%), c-met (4.8%), kras (4.5%), stk11 (2.7%), and braf (1.9%). the three most frequently altered genes in a subgroup of smokers with adenocarcinoma were egfr (22.0%), stk11 (19.0%), and kras (12.0%). we only found egfr (8.0%), c-met (2.8%), and pik3ca (2.6%) alterations in the non-smoker with squamous cell carcinoma (scc) subgroup. pten (16.1%), stk11 (8.3%), and pik3ca (7.2%) were the three most frequently enriched genes in smokers with scc. ddr2 and fgfr2 only presented in smokers with scc (4.4% and 2.2%, respectively). among these four subgroups, the differences in egfr, kras, and pten mutations were statistically significant. conclusion the distinct features of driver gene alterations in different subgroups based on histology and smoking status were helpful in defining patients for future clinical trials that target these genes. this study also suggests that we may consider patients with infrequent alterations of driver genes as having rare or orphan diseases that should be managed with special molecularly targeted therapies. to investigate the clinicopathologic and molecular features of the t790m mutation and c-met amplification in a cohort of chinese non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) patients resistant to epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tkis). egfr tki-resistant nsclc patients (n = 29) and corresponding tumor specimens, and 53 samples of postoperative tki-naïve nsclc patients were collected. egfr exon 19, 20, and 21 mutations were analyzed. and c-met gene copy number was determined. the egfr t790m mutation in exon 20 was not detected in the population of 53 tki-naïve patients, but found in 48.3% (14/29) of the enrolled tki-resistant patients. c-met was amplified in 3.8% (2/53) of the tki-naïve nsclc patients and highly amplified in 17.2% (5/29) of the cohort. most of t790m mutations were frequently associated with non-smoker, adenocarcinoma and egfr activating mutations. three male patients with t790m mutation occurred with wild-type egfr, and were resistant to the treatments following tki resistance. features of c-met amplification in tki-naïve patients were indistinguishable from tki-resistant patients. in the group of wild-type egfr, patients with t790m mutation had median progression free survival (pfs) and overall survival (os) as 9.6 months and 12.6 months, respectively; whereas the median pfs and os of c-met amplified patients was 4.1 months and 8.0 months, respectively. these results suggest that egfr t790m mutation and c-met amplification can occur in tki-resistant nsclc with wild-type egfr, and these genetic defects might be related to different survival outcome. c-met amplification in tki-naïve or -resistant patients might share similarities in clinicopathologic features.
high-frequency electrical stimulation (hfs) of the human skin induces increased pain sensitivity in the surrounding unconditioned skin. the aim of the present study was to characterize the relative contribution of the different types of nociceptive and nonnociceptive afferents to the heterotopical hyperalgesia induced by hfs. in 17 healthy volunteers (9 men and 8 women), we applied hfs to the ventral forearm. the intensity of perception and event-related brain potentials (erps) elicited by vibrotactile stimuli exclusively activating nonnociceptive low-threshold mechanoreceptors and thermonociceptive stimuli exclusively activating heat-sensitive nociceptive afferents were recorded before and after hfs. the previously described mechanical hyperalgesia following hfs was confirmed by measuring the changes in the intensity of perception elicited by mechanical punctate stimuli. hfs increased the perceived intensity of both mechanical punctate and thermonociceptive stimuli applied to the surrounding unconditioned skin. the time course of the effect of hfs on the perception of mechanical and thermal nociceptive stimuli was similar. this indicates that hfs does not only induce mechanical hyperalgesia, but also induces heat hyperalgesia in the heterotopical area. vibrotactile erps were also enhanced after hfs, indicating that nonnociceptive somatosensory input could contribute to the enhanced responses to mechanical pinprick stimuli. finally, the magnitude of thermonociceptive erps was unaffected by hfs, indicating that type ii a-fiber mechano-heat nociceptors, thought to be the primary contributor to these brain responses, do not significantly contribute to the observed heat hyperalgesia. knowing whether an individual prefers the left or right hand for skilled activities is important to researchers in experimental psychology and neuroscience. the current study reports on a new measure of skilled hand preference derived from the provins and cunliffe (1972) handedness inventory. undergraduates (n = 3324) indicated their lateral preference for their hands, feet, eyes and ears. a measure of hand performance and familial handedness was also obtained. factor analysis identified ten items that loaded on skilled hand preference and these were included in the new flanders questionnaire. cluster analysis of the new questionnaire revealed three distinct groups (left-, mixed- & right-handed). the new test showed a strong association with other measures of lateral preference and hand performance. scores on the test were also related to the sex of the respondent and the hand preference of their parents. the flanders provides a measure of skilled hand preference that is easy to administer and understand and should be useful for experimenters wanting to screen for hand preference.
deep tissue injury (dti) is a severe pressure ulcer, which initiates in skeletal muscle tissue under intact skin. patients with spinal cord injury (sci) are especially vulnerable to dti, due to their impaired motosensory capacities. the underlying mechanisms that lead to dti are, however, still poorly understood. this study focuses on cell-level temperature distributions in muscles of patients with sci, which typically contain thinner muscle fibers and fewer capillaries. it has been shown previously by our group that ischemic muscles of rat models of dti cool down mildly and locally, which is very likely to slow the diffusivity of metabolites in the ischemic regions. however, it is unclear how these temperature decreases affect diffusivity at the scale of individual muscle cells in the microanatomy of sci patients. we hypothesize that a 2°c drop in the temperature of inflowing capillary blood, as shown in our animal studies, has a substantial effect on lowering the diffusivity of metabolites in skeletal muscle, but the pathological microanatomy in the chronic phase of sci is less dominant in affecting the local temperatures in and around muscle cells. in order to test this hypothesis, two-dimensional finite element (fe) models of cross sections through the microanatomy of muscle tissue were developed using comsol multiphysics software for normal and sci muscles. the models included muscle cells, extracellular matrix (ecm), and capillaries, each with its own geometrical, thermal, and heat production properties. the sci model configuration specifically included reduced cross section of myofibrils in favor of more ecm, less capillaries, and decreased blood inflow rate. after a 20-s heat transfer simulation, it was found that temperatures around the cells of the sci muscle were approximately 2°c lower than that in the normal muscle, that is, heat production from the muscle cell metabolism did not compensate for the lower inflowing blood temperature in the sci model. we conclude that the temperature and rate of inflowing capillary blood are the dominant factors determining the localized temperatures in the microarchitecture of an ischemic sci muscle tissue. the altered sci microanatomy was shown to be less influential. taken together with the stokes–einstein theory, our results indicate that diffusivity of metabolites would be approximately 50% less around the cells of sci muscle due to local cooling, which is yet another factor compromising tissue viability in the patients with sci. resistance to blood flow through peripheral vascular beds strongly influences cardiovascular function and transport to tissue. for a given vascular architecture, flow resistance is determined by the rheological behavior of blood flowing through microvessels. a new approach for calculating the contribution of blood rheology to microvascular flow resistance is presented. morphology (diameter and length), flow velocity, hematocrit, and topological position were determined for all vessel segments (up to 913) of terminal microcirculatory networks in the rat mesentery by intravital microscopy. flow velocity and hematocrit were also predicted from mathematical flow simulations, in which the assumed dependence of flow resistance on diameter, hematocrit, and shear rate was optimized to minimize the deviation between measured and predicted values. for microvessels with diameters below approximately 40 microns, the resulting flow resistances are markedly higher and show a stronger dependence on hematocrit than previously estimated from measurements of blood flow in narrow glass tubes. for example, flow resistance in 10-microns microvessels at normal hematocrit is found to exceed that of a corresponding glass tube by a factor of approximately 4. in separate experiments, flow resistance of microvascular networks was estimated from direct measurements of total pressure drop and volume flow, at systemic hematocrits intentionally varied from 0.08 to 0.68. the results agree closely with predictions based on the above-optimized resistance but not with predictions based on glass-tube data. the unexpectedly high flow resistance in small microvessels may be related to interactions between blood components and the inner vessel surface that do not occur in smooth-walled tubes.
we have shown previously (saengsirisuwan v, kinnick tr, schmit mb, and henriksen ej. j appl physiol 91: 145-153, 2001) that the antioxidant r-(+)-alpha-lipoic acid (r-ala), combined with endurance exercise training (et), increases glucose transport in insulin-resistant skeletal muscle in an additive fashion. the purpose of the present study was to investigate possible cellular mechanisms responsible for this interactive effect. we evaluated the effects of r-ala alone, et alone, or r-ala and et in combination on insulin-stimulated glucose transport, protein expression, and functionality of specific insulin-signaling factors in soleus muscle of obese zucker (fa/fa) rats. obese animals remained sedentary, received r-ala (30 mg.kg body wt(-1).day(-1)), performed et (daily treadmill running for < or =60 min), or underwent both r-ala treatment and et for 15 days. r-ala or et individually increased (p < 0.05) insulin-mediated (5 mu/ml) glucose transport (2-deoxyglucose uptake) in soleus muscle by 45 and 68%, respectively, and this value was increased to the greatest extent (124%) in the combined treatment group. soleus insulin receptor substrate (irs)-1 protein was significantly increased by r-ala alone (30%) or et alone (31%), and a further enhancement (55%) was observed after the combination treatment in the obese animals. enhanced levels of irs-1 protein expression after individual or combined interventions were significantly correlated with insulin action on glucose transport activity (r = 0.597, p = 0.0055). similarly, insulin-mediated irs-1 associated with the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase was increased by r-ala (317%) and et (319%) and to the greatest extent (435%) (all p < 0.05) by the combination treatment. these results indicate that the improvements of insulin action in insulin-resistant skeletal muscle after r-ala or et, alone and in combination, were associated with increases in irs-1 protein expression and irs-1 associated with p85. voluntary wheel running (wr) by juvenile female rats was used as a noninterventional model of soleus muscle functional overload to study the regulation of insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity by the glucose transporter (glut-4 isoform) protein level and glycogen concentration. soleus total protein content was significantly greater (+18%; p < 0.05) than in age-matched controls after 1 wk of wr, and this hypertrophic response continued in weeks 2-4 (+24-32%). glut-4 protein was 39% greater than in controls in 1-wk wr soleus, and this adaptation was accompanied by a similar increase in in vitro insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity (+29%). after 2 and 4 wk of wr, however, insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity had returned to control levels, despite a continued elevation (+25-28%) of glut-4 protein. at these two time points, glycogen concentration was significantly enhanced in wr soleus (+21-42%), which coincided with significant reductions in glycogen synthase activity ratios (-23 to -41%). these results indicate that, in this model of soleus muscle functional overload, the glut-4 protein level may initially regulate insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity in the absence of changes in other modifying factors. however, this regulation of glucose transport activity by glut-4 protein may be subsequently overridden by elevated glycogen concentration.
in the anesthetized cat we used laser-doppler flowmetry to investigate the part played by cervical superior sympathetic trunk (cst) fibers in the control of blood vessels in an orofacial area (the lower lip). the blood flow increase (antidromic vasodilatation) elicited by inferior alveolar nerve (ian) stimulation was not affected by ongoing repetitive cst stimulation over the frequency range examined (0.2-10 hz), although reflex parasympathetic vasodilatation was attenuated. the vasoconstrictor responses elicited by ian stimulation in some preparations were reduced in a frequency-dependent manner (at 0.2-1 hz) during ongoing cst stimulation (and replaced by vasodilator responses). the vasoconstrictor response evoked directly by brief cst stimulation was attenuated, but not transformed to a vasodilator response, by ongoing cst stimulation. thus in the cat lower lip 1) sympathetic stimulation attenuated one type of vasodilator response (parasympathetic-mediated vasodilatation), but not another (antidromic vasodilatation), and 2) ongoing sympathetic (cst) stimulation at low frequencies (<1 hz) prevented further sympathetic-mediated vasoconstriction. 1 the present study was designed to examine the interaction between sympathetic and parasympathetic influences on blood flow in oro‐facial areas such as lower lip, palate and submandibular gland (smg) and in the common carotid artery (cca) in anaesthetized cats. 2 section of the ipsilateral superior cervical sympathetic trunk (cst) increased the basal cca blood flow significantly. the control level with the nerve intact was comparable with that seen at 0.5‐1 hz cst stimulation, suggesting a spontaneous discharge of around 0.5‐1 hz in the cst fibres innervating the beds supplied by the cca. the basal blood flow at all sites examined was reduced by cst stimulation in a frequency‐dependent manner. 3 electrical stimulation of the central end of the lingual nerve (ln) evoked blood flow increases in the lower lip and palate. these blood flow increases were markedly reduced by concurrent cst stimulation in a manner that was frequency dependent, but not simply related to the vasoconstrictor effect of cst stimulation. this effect of cst stimulation was not observed in tongue or smg, even though cst stimulation evoked vasoconstriction in these tissues. a significant reduction in the level of cca blood flow attained during ln stimulation was observed on repetitive cst stimulation only at 10 hz, indicating that this response behaved in a fashion different from that seen in the lower lip, palate, tongue and smg. 4 the present study suggests that concurrent repetitive cst stimulation reduces parasympathetically mediated blood flow increases in certain oro‐facial areas (such as the lower lip and palate), but not in the tongue and smg. this inhibitory action was not a simple additive effect (between vasoconstriction and vasodilatation) and it disappeared rapidly after the cessation of cst stimulation.
this paper reports the characterization of the antidiabetic role of a hydroethanolic extract from parkinsonia aerial parts (hepa), in normal and alloxan-induced diabetic rats, treated with hepa (125 and 250 mg/kg; p.o.). oral glucose tolerance test, acute oral toxicity test and preliminary phytochemical analyses were performed. the diabetic rats treated with hepa showed a significant reduction in serum and urinary glucose, urinary urea and triglyceride levels, as compared to the diabetic untreated group. however, in the normal treated groups, a significant reduction was found only in serum triglyceride levels. in all treated diabetic groups, an improvement in hepatic glycogen was observed, as well as a decrease in liquid intake and urinary volume, and an enhancement in the weight of skeletal muscles (soleus and extensor digitorum longus), kidneys and epididymal adipose tissue. nevertheless, body and liver weights were ameliorated only in the diabetic group treated with hepa (250 mg/kg). moreover, oral glucose tolerance was higher in animals treated with hepa, while results also showed that hepa could be considered toxicologically safe. phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of tanins, flavonoids and steroids in hepa. in conclusion, p. aculeata presents an antidiabetic activity and other beneficial effects that ameliorate diabetes and associated complications. hypoglycemic effect of gentiana olivieri griseb. (gentianaceae) flowering herbs on oral administration were studied using in vivo models in normal, glucose-hyperglycemic and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. through in vivo bioassay-guided fractionation processes isoorientin, a known c-glycosylflavone, was isolated from the ethylacetate fraction by silica gel column chromatography as the main active ingredient from the plant. isoorientin exhibited significant hypoglycemic and antihyperlipidemic effects at 15 mg/kg b.w.dose. isoorientin concentration of the extracts and fractions were determined by hplc in order to establish a correlation between the hypoglycaemic activity.
symbionts are widespread and might have a substantial effect on the outcome of interactions between species, such as in host-parasitoid systems. here, we studied the effects of symbionts on the outcome of host-parasitoid interactions in a four-partner system, consisting of the parasitoid wasp leptopilina boulardi, its two hosts drosophila melanogaster and d. simulans, the wasp virus lbfv, and the endosymbiotic bacterium wolbachia. the virus is known to manipulate the superparasitism behavior of the parasitoid whereas some wolbachia strains can reproductively manipulate and/or confer pathogen protection to drosophila hosts. we used two nuclear backgrounds for both drosophila species, infected with or cured of their respective wolbachia strains, and offered them to l. boulardi of one nuclear background, either infected or uninfected by the virus. the main defence mechanism against parasitoids, i.e. encapsulation, and other important traits of the interaction were measured. the results showed that virus-infected parasitoids are less frequently encapsulated than uninfected ones. further experiments showed that this viral effect involved both a direct protective effect against encapsulation and an indirect effect of superparasitism. additionally, the wolbachia strain wau affected the encapsulation ability of its drosophila host but the direction of this effect was strongly dependent on the presence/absence of lbfv. our results confirmed the importance of heritable symbionts in the outcome of antagonistic interactions. wolbachia are a group of intracellular inherited bacteria that infect a wide range of arthropods. they are associated with a number of different reproductive phenotypes in their hosts, such as cytoplasmic incompatibility, parthenogenesis and feminization. while it is known that the bacterial strains responsible for these different host phenotypes form a single clade within the α–proteobacteria, until now it has not been possible to resolve the evolutionary relationships between differentwolbachia strains. to address this issue we have cloned and sequenced a gene encoding a surface protein ofwolbachia (wsp) from a representative sample of 28wolbachia strains. the sequences from this gene were highly variable and could be used to resolve the phylogenetic relationships of differentwolbachia strains. based on the sequence of thewsp gene from differentwolbachia isolates we propose that thewolbachia pipientis clade be initially divided into 12 groups. as more sequence information becomes available we expect the number of such groups to increase. in addition, we present a method ofwolbachia classification based on the use of group–specificwsp pcr primers which will allowwolbachia isolates to be typed without the need to clone and sequence individualwolbachia genes. this system should facilitate future studies investigating the distribution and biology ofwolbachia strains from large samples of different host species.
aims/hypothesisthe action of incretin hormones including glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (gip) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (glp-1) is potentiated in animal models defective in glucagon action. it has been reported that such animal models maintain normoglycaemia under streptozotocin (stz)-induced beta cell damage. however, the role of gip in regulation of glucose metabolism under a combination of glucagon deficiency and stz-induced beta cell damage has not been fully explored.methodsin this study, we investigated glucose metabolism in mice deficient in proglucagon-derived peptides (pgdps)—namely glucagon gene knockout (gcgko) mice—administered with stz. single high-dose stz (200 mg/kg, hstz) or moderate-dose stz for five consecutive days (50 mg/kg × 5, mstz) was administered to gcgko mice. the contribution of gip to glucose metabolism in gcgko mice was also investigated by experiments employing dipeptidyl peptidase iv (dpp4) inhibitor (dpp4i) or gcg–gipr double knockout (dko) mice.resultsgcgko mice developed severe diabetes by hstz administration despite the absence of glucagon. administration of mstz decreased pancreatic insulin content to 18.8 ± 3.4 (%) in gcgko mice, but ad libitum-fed blood glucose levels did not significantly increase. glucose-induced insulin secretion was marginally impaired in mstz-treated gcgko mice but was abolished in mstz-treated dko mice. although gcgko mice lack glp-1, treatment with dpp4i potentiated glucose-induced insulin secretion and ameliorated glucose intolerance in mstz-treated gcgko mice, but did not increase beta cell area or significantly reduce apoptotic cells in islets.conclusions/interpretationthese results indicate that gip has the potential to ameliorate glucose intolerance even under stz-induced beta cell damage by increasing insulin secretion rather than by promoting beta cell survival. aims/introduction:  excessive intake of sucrose can cause severe health issues, such as diabetes mellitus. in animal studies, consumption of a high‐sucrose diet (suc) has been shown to cause obesity, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. however, several in vivo experiments have been carried out using diets with much higher sucrose contents (50–70% of the total calories) than are typically ingested by humans. in the present study, we examined the effects of a moderate suc on glucose metabolism and the underlying mechanism.
the orbitofrontal cortex (ofc) has strong reciprocal connections to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlpfc), which is known to participate in spatial working memory processes. however, it is not known whether or not the ofc also participates in spatial working memory and whether the ofc and dlpfc contribute equally to this process. to address these issues, we collected single-neuron activity from both areas while a monkey performed an oculomotor delayed-response task, and compared the characteristics of task-related activities between the ofc and dlpfc. all of the task-related activities observed in the dlpfc were also observed in the ofc. however, the proportion and response characteristics of task-related activities were different between the two areas. while most delay-period activity observed in the dlpfc was directionally selective and showed tonic sustained activation, most delay-period activity observed in the ofc was omni-directional and showed gradually increasing activity. reward-period activity was predominant among task-related activities in the ofc. the proportion of neurons showing reward-period activity was significantly higher in the ofc than in the dlpfc. these results suggest that, although both the ofc and dlpfc participate in spatial working memory processes, the ofc is related more to the expectation and the detection of reward delivery, while the dlpfc is related more to the temporary maintenance of spatial information and its processing. 1. single-neuron activity was recorded from the prefrontal cortex of monkeys performing saccadic eye movements in oculomotor delayed-response (odr) and visually guided saccade (vgs) tasks. in the odr task the monkey was required to maintain fixation of a central spot throughout the 0.5-s cue and 3.0-s delay before making a saccadic eye movement in the dark to one of four or eight locations where the visual cue had been presented. the same locations were used for targets in the vgs tasks; however, unlike the odr task, saccades in the vgs tasks were visually guided. 2. among 434 neurons recorded from prefrontal cortex within and surrounding the principal sulcus (ps), 147 changed their discharge rates in relation to saccadic eye movements in the odr task. their response latencies relative to saccade initiation were distributed between -192 and 460-ms, with 22% exhibiting presaccadic activity and 78% exhibiting only postsaccadic activity. among ps neurons with presaccadic activity, 53% also had postsaccadic activity when the monkey made saccadic eye movements opposite to the directions for which the presaccadic activity was observed. 3. almost all (97%) ps neurons with presaccadic activity were directionally selective. the best direction and tuning specificity of each neuron were estimated from parameters used to fit a gaussian tuning curve function. the best direction for 62% of the neurons with presaccadic activity was toward the contralateral visual field, with the remaining neurons having best directions toward the ipsilateral field (23%) or along the vertical meridian (15%). 4. most postsaccadic activity of ps neurons (92%) was also directionally selective. the best direction for 48% of these neurons was toward the contralateral visual field, with the remaining neurons having best directions toward the ipsilateral field (36%) or along the vertical meridian (16%). eighteen percent of the neurons with postsaccadic activity showed a reciprocal response pattern: excitatory responses occurred for one set of saccade directions, whereas inhibitory responses occurred for roughly the opposite set of directions. 5. sixty ps neurons with saccade-related activity in the odr task were also examined in a vgs task. forty of these neurons showed highly similar profiles of directional specificity and response magnitude in both tasks, 13 showed saccade-related activity only in the odr task, and 7 changed their response characteristics between the odr and vgs tasks.(abstract truncated at 400 words)
background myelination is an exquisite and dynamic example of heterologous cell-cell interaction, which consists of the concentric wrapping of multiple layers of oligodendrocyte membrane around neuronal axons. understanding the mechanism by which oligodendrocytes ensheath axons may bring us closer to designing strategies to promote remyelination in demyelinating diseases. the main aim of this study was to follow glial-axonal interactions over time both in vitro and ex vivo to visualize the various stages of myelination. methodology/principal findings we took two approaches to follow myelination over time: i) time-lapse imaging of mixed cns myelinating cultures generated from mouse spinal cord to which exogenous gfp-labelled murine cells were added, and ii) ex vivo imaging of the spinal cord of shiverer (mbp mutant) mice, transplanted with gfp-labelled murine neurospheres. we demonstrate that oligodendrocyte-axonal interactions are dynamic events with continuous retraction and extension of oligodendroglial processes. using cytoplasmic and membrane-gfp labelled cells to examine different components of the myelin-like sheath, we provide evidence from time-lapse fluorescence microscopy and confocal microscopy that the oligodendrocytes' cytoplasm-filled processes initially spiral around the axon in a corkscrew-like manner. this is followed subsequently by focal expansion of the corkscrew process to form short cuffs, which then extend longitudinally along the axons. we predict from this model that these spiral cuffs must extend over each other first before extending to form internodes of myelin. conclusion these experiments show the feasibility of visualizing the dynamics of glial-axonal interaction during myelination over time. moreover, these approaches complement each other with the in vitro approach allowing visualization of an entire internodal length of myelin and the ex vivo approach validating the in vitro data. abstract: the gene expression of myelin basic proteins (mbps) in shiverer mutant mice was investigated by the northern and southern hybridization techniques. in the control mice rna molecules from the brains which were about 2,300 nucleotides in length were hybridized to cdna of 1.8 kb encoding for a mouse mbp, but rna from the brains of 3‐week‐old shiverer mutant mice contained no detectable amount of mbp transcripts hybridizing to this probe. moreover the shiverer mutant mice lost several restriction fragments that hybridized to the same probe in the control mice when each of the five restriction enzymes, i.e., hindiii, psti, pvuii, acci, and stui, was used. these data suggest that the shiverer mutation may correspond to the deletion of a large portion of mbp exon(s) in the gene, and this deletion causes inefficient transcription leading to the depletion of mbps in the myelin and the dysmyelination observed in these mice.
image by j. e. maragos. foreground: m. capitata; above: m. dilatata; above, lower left: invasive algae (kappaphycus/eucheuma spp.) 2 executive summary montipora dilatata is considered to be one of the rarest corals known. thought to be endemic to hawaii, only a few colonies have ever been found despite extensive surveys. endangered species status would have major conservation implications; however, coral species boundaries are poorly understood. in order to examine genetic and morphological variation in hawaiian montipora, a suite of molecular markers (mitochondrial: coi, cr, cyt-b, 16s, atp6; nuclear: atpsβ, its), in addition to a suite of measurements on skeletal microstructure, were examined. the its region and mitochondrial markers revealed four distinct clades: i) m. patula/m. verilli, ii) m. incrassata, iii) m. capitata, iv) m. dilatata/m. flabellata/m. turgescens. the nuclear atpsβ intron tree had several exceptions that are generally interpreted as resulting from recent hybridization between clades or incomplete lineage sorting. since the multicopy nuclear its region was concordant with the mitochondrial data, incomplete lineage sorting of the atpsβ intron is a more likely explanation. principal components analysis (pca) of microstructure measurements agreed with the genetic clades rather than the nominal taxa. these species groups therefore either represent recent or insipient (ca <1mya) species or morphological variants of the same biological species. these clades are likely to occur outside of hawaii according to mitochondrial control region haplotypes from previous studies. common garden experiments were conducted on distinct morphotypes of m. capitata to test the hypothesis that micro-skeletal traits can be phenotypically plastic in this genus. although the experiment suffered high mortality from parasitic flatworms, verrucae (rice-grain sized bumps) were documented to form on formerly smooth colonies, indicating plasticity. this study contributes towards understanding the relationship between genetic and morphological variation in this taxonomically challenging group, which is essential for effective conservation and the key to understanding the evolution and biodiversity of reef building corals. management implications this study identified two closely related species complexes (m. dilatata/m. flabellata/m. turgescens and m. patula/m. verilli) that may occur outside of hawaii. we found no significant genetic or micro-skeletal differences between nominal taxa within these species complexes; however, this study may not be capable of detecting recent or insipient species (ca <1mya). now that these species complexes have been identified, population genetic and/or reproductive studies are necessary to determine if the nominal species within each complex are actively interbreeding. the findings of rapid evolution and … summary the program modeltest uses log likelihood scores to establish the model of dna evolution that best fits the data.   availability the modeltest package, including the source code and some documentation is available at http://bioag.byu. edu/zoology/crandall_lab/modeltest.html.
introduction this study aimed to determine compliance with noninvasive home ventilation in children with obstructive sleep apnoea and the factors affecting this compliance.   methods we retrospectively reviewed 51 children who were prescribed noninvasive home ventilation for the management of obstructive sleep apnoea from 1 january 2000 until 31 may 2008. noninvasive ventilation was started based on positive polysomnogram, i.e. obstructive apnoea hypopnea index ≥ 1/hr. compliance was defined as the use of noninvasive ventilation ≥ 4 days/week.   results noninvasive home ventilation was started at a median age of 11.5 years. in all, 21 (41.2 %) children were reported to be compliant with treatment. univariate analysis revealed that the female gender (p = 0.017), presence of asthma (p = 0.023), presence of genetic syndromes (p = 0.023), use of bi-level ventilation versus continuous positive airway pressure (p = 0.027), and funding from the social work department (p = 0.049) were associated with compliance with noninvasive home ventilation. logistic regression revealed the presence of asthma (p = 0.008) and female gender (p = 0.047) to be significantly associated with compliance with treatment. however, factors such as counselling prior to initiation of treatment, severity of obstructive sleep apnoea before initiation of treatment, obesity, use of humidification, and polysomnogram indices were not found to be associated with treatment compliance.   conclusion only 41.2% of the children in this study were reported to be compliant with noninvasive home ventilation. the female gender and the presence of asthma were associated with treatment compliance. future research focusing on effective methods to improve compliance with noninvasive home ventilation in children should be undertaken. positive airway pressure (pap) devices are used to treat patients with sleep related breathing disorders (srbds), including obstructive sleep apnea (osa). after a patient is diagnosed with osa, the current standard of practice involves performing attended polysomnography (psg), during which positive airway pressure is adjusted throughout the recording period to determine the optimal pressure for maintaining upper airway patency. continuous positive airway pressure (cpap) and bilevel positive airway pressure (bpap) represent the two forms of pap that are manually titrated during psg to determine the single fixed pressure of cpap or the fixed inspiratory and expiratory positive airway pressures (ipap and epap, respectively) of bpap for subsequent nightly usage. a pap titration task force of the american academy of sleep medicine reviewed the available literature. based on this review, the task force developed these recommendations for conducting cpap and bpap titrations. major recommendations are as follows: (1) all potential pap titration candidates should receive adequate pap education, hands-on demonstration, careful mask fitting, and acclimatization prior to titration. (2) cpap (ipap and/or epap for patients on bpap) should be increased until the following obstructive respiratory events are eliminated (no specific order) or the recommended maximum cpap (ipap for patients on bpap) is reached: apneas, hypopneas, respiratory effort-related arousals (reras), and snoring. (3) the recommended minimum starting cpap should be 4 cm h2o for pediatric and adult patients, and the recommended minimum starting ipap and epap should be 8 cm h2o and 4 cm h2o, respectively, for pediatric and adult patients on bpap. (4) the recommended maximum cpap should be 15 cm h2o (or recommended maximum ipap of 20 cm h2o if on bpap) for patients < 12 years, and 20 cm h2o (or recommended maximum ipap of 30 cm h2o if on bpap) for patients > or = 12 years. (5) the recommended minimum ipap-epap differential is 4 cm h2o and the recommended maximum ipap-epap differential is 10 cm h2o (6) cpap (ipap and/or epap for patients on bpap depending on the type of event) should be increased by at least 1 cm h2o with an interval no shorter than 5 min, with the goal of eliminating obstructive respiratory events. (7) cpap (ipap and epap for patients on bpap) should be increased from any cpap (or ipap) level if at least 1 obstructive apnea is observed for patients < 12 years, or if at least 2 obstructive apneas are observed for patients > or = 12 years. (8) cpap (ipap for patients on bpap) should be increased from any cpap (or ipap) level if at least 1 hypopnea is observed for patients < 12 years, or if at least 3 hypopneas are observed for patients > or = 12 years. (9) cpap (ipap for patients on bpap) should be increased from any cpap (or ipap) level if at least 3 reras are observed for patients < 12 years, or if at least 5 reras are observed for patients > or = 12 years. (10) cpap (ipap for patients on bpap) may be increased from any cpap (or ipap) level if at least 1 min of loud or unambiguous snoring is observed for patients < 12 years, or if at least 3 min of loud or unambiguous snoring are observed for patients > or = 12 years. (11) the titration algorithm for split-night cpap or bpap titration studies should be identical to that of full-night cpap or bpap titration studies, respectively. (12) if the patient is uncomfortable or intolerant of high pressures on cpap, the patient may be tried on bpap. if there are continued obstructive respiratory events at 15 cm h2o of cpap during the titration study, the patient may be switched to bpap. (13) the pressure of cpap or bpap selected for patient use following the titration study should reflect control of the patient's obstructive respiration by a low (preferably < 5 per hour) respiratory disturbance index (rdi) at the selected pressure, a minimum sea level spo2 above 90% at the pressure, and with a leak within acceptable parameters at the pressure.) (14) an optimal titration reduces rdi < 5 for at least a 15-min duration and should include supine rem sleep at the selected pressure that is not continually interrupted by spontaneous arousals or awakenings. (15) a good titration reduces rdi < or = 10 or by 50% if the baseline rdi < 15 and should include supine rem sleep that is not continually interrupted by spontaneous arousals or awakenings at the selected pressure. (16) an adequate titration does not reduce the rdi < or = 10 but reduces the rdi by 75% from baseline (especially in severe osa patients), or one in which the titration grading criteria for optimal or good are met with the exception that supine rem sleep did not occur at the selected pressure. (17) an unacceptable titration is one that does not meet any one of the above grades. (18) a repeat pap titration study should be considered if the initial titration does not achieve a grade of optimal or good and, if it is a split-night psg study, it fails to meet aasm criteria (i.e., titration duration should be > 3 hr).
contextual information is crucial for semantic segmentation. however, finding the optimal trade-off between keeping desired fine details and at the same time providing sufficiently large receptive fields is non trivial. this is even more so, when objects or classes present in an image significantly vary in size. dilated convolutions have proven valuable for semantic segmentation, because they allow to increase the size of the receptive field without sacrificing image resolution. however, in current state-of-the-art methods, dilation parameters are hand-tuned and fixed. in this paper, we present an approach for learning dilation parameters adaptively per channel, consistently improving semantic segmentation results on street-scene datasets like cityscapes and camvid. convolutional networks are powerful visual models that yield hierarchies of features. we show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, improve on the previous best result in semantic segmentation. our key insight is to build “fully convolutional” networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. we define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. we adapt contemporary classification networks (alexnet, the vgg net, and googlenet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. we then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. our fully convolutional networks achieve improved segmentation of pascal voc (30% relative improvement to 67.2% mean iu on 2012), nyudv2, sift flow, and pascal-context, while inference takes one tenth of a second for a typical image.
research has indicated that atrial fibrillation (af) ablation failure is related to the presence of atrial fibrosis. however it remains unclear whether this information can be successfully used in predicting the optimal ablation targets for af termination. we aimed to provide a proof-of-concept that patient-specific virtual electrophysiological study that combines i) atrial structure and fibrosis distribution from clinical mri and ii) modeling of atrial electrophysiology, could be used to predict: (1) how fibrosis distribution determines the locations from which paced beats degrade into af; (2) the dynamic behavior of persistent af rotors; and (3) the optimal ablation targets in each patient. four mri-based patient-specific models of fibrotic left atria were generated, ranging in fibrosis amount. virtual electrophysiological studies were performed in these models, and where af was inducible, the dynamics of af were used to determine the ablation locations that render af non-inducible. in 2 of the 4 models patient-specific models af was induced; in these models the distance between a given pacing location and the closest fibrotic region determined whether af was inducible from that particular location, with only the mid-range distances resulting in arrhythmia. phase singularities of persistent rotors were found to move within restricted regions of tissue, which were independent of the pacing location from which af was induced. electrophysiological sensitivity analysis demonstrated that these regions changed little with variations in electrophysiological parameters. patient-specific distribution of fibrosis was thus found to be a critical component of af initiation and maintenance. when the restricted regions encompassing the meander of the persistent phase singularities were modeled as ablation lesions, af could no longer be induced. the study demonstrates that a patient-specific modeling approach to identify non-invasively af ablation targets prior to the clinical procedure is feasible. personalized computational cardiac models are emerging as an important tool for studying cardiac arrhythmia mechanisms, and have the potential to become powerful instruments for guiding clinical anti-arrhythmia therapy. in this article, we present the methodology for constructing a patient-specific model of atrial fibrosis as a substrate for atrial fibrillation. the model is constructed from high-resolution late gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (lge-mri) images acquired in vivo from a patient suffering from persistent atrial fibrillation, accurately capturing both the patient's atrial geometry and the distribution of the fibrotic regions in the atria. atrial fiber orientation is estimated using a novel image-based method, and fibrosis is represented in the patient-specific fibrotic regions as incorporating collagenous septa, gap junction remodeling, and myofibroblast proliferation. a proof-of-concept simulation result of reentrant circuits underlying atrial fibrillation in the model of the patient's fibrotic atrium is presented to demonstrate the completion of methodology development.
stable isotope measurements are employed extensively in plant–water relations research to investigate physiological and hydrological processes from whole plant to ecosystem scales. stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen are routinely measured to identify plant source water. this application relies on the assumption that no fractionation of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in water occurs during uptake by roots. however, a large fraction of the water taken up through roots in halophytic and xerophytic plants transverses cell membranes in the endodermis before entering the root xylem. passage of water through this symplastic pathway has been hypothesized to cause fractionation leading to a decrease in 2h of root xylem water relative to that in the surrounding soil medium. we examined 16 woody halophytic and xerophytic plant species in controlled conditions for evidence of hydrogen isotope fractionation during uptake at the root–soil interface. isotopic separation (δ2h = δ2hsoil water − δ2hxylem water) ranging from 3‰ to 9‰ was observed in 12 species. a significant positive correlation between salinity tolerance and the magnitude of δ2h was observed. water in whole stem segments, sapwood, and roots had significantly lower δ2h values relative to soil water in prosopis velutina woot., the species expressing the greatest δ2h values among the 16 species examined. pressurized water flow through intact root systems of artemisia tridentata nutt. and atriplex canescens (pursh) nutt. caused the δ2h values to decrease as flow rate increased. this relationship was not observed in p. velutina. destroying the plasma membranes of root cells by excessive heat from boiling did not significantly alter the relationship between δ2h of expressed water and flow rate. in light of these results, care should be taken when using the stable isotope method to examine source-water use in halophytic and xerophytic species. summarycrops sprinkled with saline irrigation water are subject to foliar salt absorption and injury as well as to injury from soil salinity. yield reductions caused by soil salinity alone are well documented, and data are presented here for 71 agricultural crops. factors affecting these data and their applicability to sprinkler-irrigated crops are discussed. although foliar injury has been observed with many sprinkled crops, particularly tree crops, essentially no information is available to predict yield losses as a function of the salt concentration of the irrigation water. salinity thresholds for sprinkling-induced foliar injury are estimated for some crops; however, climatic conditions greatly affect the onset and degree of injury. managment strategies that minimize sprinkling injury are mentioned.
we assessed the effects of coagulation factor vii (fvii) gene polymorphisms, lipid-related polymorphisms, and exercise training-induced plasma lipoprotein lipid changes on fvii level changes with exercise training in middle- to older-aged men and women. forty-six healthy sedentary men and women were stabilized on a low-fat diet and then underwent baseline testing, 6 mo of endurance exercise training, and final testing. plasma fvii-ag levels decreased with exercise training (106.7 +/- 1.4 vs. 104.2 +/- 1.6%, p = 0.005). there were no significant differences in fvii-ag changes with exercise training between -323 (0/10 bp)/-401 (g/t) haplotype or -402 (g/a) genotype groups. fvii-ag changes with training were not correlated with changes in plasma lipoprotein lipids. in linear regression analyses, fvii-ag changes with training remained significant after adjusting for training-induced plasma lipoprotein lipid changes (p = 0.01). fvii changes with training were associated with apolipoprotein e genotype (p = 0.012); this relationship was still evident after adjusting for training-induced plasma lipoprotein lipid changes (p = 0.047). fvii changes with training also were significantly associated with human atpase binding cassette-1 genotype (p = 0.018); this relationship persisted after accounting for the effect of the training-induced plasma lipoprotein lipid changes (p = 0.045). we conclude that plasma fvii-ag changes with exercise training are more closely related to selected lipid-related genotypes than fvii gene promoter variants. objective to cross-sectionally evaluate the presence of clustering of the insulin-resistance syndrome components. tests were conducted for association of the hind iii restriction site polymorphism at the lipoprotein lipase locus with clustering of the physiological components of the insulin resistance syndrome. research design and methods dna samples of 370 normoglycemic hispanics and 520 normoglycemic non-hispanic whites from the san luis valley, colorado, were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. lipids and glucose were determined by the standard procedures. cross-tabulation and χ2 analysis were used. results the insulin-resistance syndrome components (elevated fasting insulin, reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and elevated triglycerides) appeared together in individuals of this population sample more often than expected by chance. individuals in the population with the (+/+) lipoprotein lipase-hindiii restriction of fragment-length polymorphism genotype were more likely to have elevated fasting insulin and triglycerides and a reduced high-density lipoproteincholesterol level than subjects with the (+/−) genotype (odds ratio = 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.38–3.98). conclusions as expected from the physiological function of lipoprotein lipase, the primary association of lipoprotein lipase genotypes is with triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels. this appears to be the first reported genetic association with the insulin-resistance syndrome and may reflect genotype specific differences in the regulation of lipoprotein lipase by insulin.
background familial hypercholesterolemia (fh) is an autosomal dominant inherited disease caused by mutations in either the low-density lipoprotein receptor, the apolipoprotein b or the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 genes. it is characterized by a high concentration of low-density lipoprotein (ldl), which frequently gives rise to premature coronary disease. in this study, we report a novel splice site mutation of the ldl receptor gene in a tunisian family.   methods seven patients from the family were screened for mutations in the ldlr gene and the apob gene, using direct sequencing. rt-pcr and study on cultured skin fibroblast were realised to characterize the effect of novel mutation.   results direct sequencing of the promoter and 18 exons reveals a g>a substitution in the splice site junction of intron 8 (c.1186+1 g>a). study on cultured skin fibroblasts showed a residual activity of 10% of the ldl receptor. reverse transcription, amplification and direct sequencing of rna from patient's lymphocytes reveal a deletion of the final 51 bp of exon 8 preserving the reading frame.   conclusions the study identified a novel splice mutation c.1186+1 g>a in the ldl receptor gene. it causes the utilization of a new cryptic donor splice site 51 bp downstream from the normal site. the low density lipoprotein (ldl) receptor is a cell surface transmembrane protein that mediates the uptake and lysosomal degradation of plasma ldl, thereby providing cholesterol to cells. mutations disrupting the function of this receptor produce autosomal dominant familial hypercholesterolemia (fh). affected individuals have elevated plasma levels of ldl, which causes premature coronary atherosclerosis. to date, 71 mutations in the ldl receptor gene have been characterized at a molecular level. in this report, we describe 79 additional mutations and review the insights that all 150 mutations have provided into the structure/function relationship of the receptor protein and the clinical manifestations of fh. © 1992 wiley‐liss, inc.
negatively stained influenza virions sometimes show irregular morphology and are often referred to as pleomorphic. however, this irregular morphology has not been visualized when ultrathin-section transmission and scanning electron microscopies are used. this study focused on the effects of ultracentrifugation on influenza a virion morphology, as negative staining often involves ultracentrifugation to concentrate or purify virions. the morphologies of unfixed, glutaraldehyde-fixed and osmium tetroxide-fixed virions were quantitatively compared before and after ultracentrifugation, and it was found that, without chemical fixation, approximately 30% of virions were altered from oval to irregular shapes following ultracentrifugation. by contrast, most glutaraldehyde-fixed virions remained uniformly elliptical, even after ultracentrifugation. when a virus with an 11 aa deletion at the c terminus of its m2 cytoplasmic tail was ultracentrifuged, its morphology was appreciably deformed compared with that of the wild-type virus. these results demonstrate that the native morphology of influenza a virions is regular but is disrupted by ultracentrifugation, and that the cytoplasmic tail of m2 is important for virion integrity. abstract the viral replication cycle concludes with the assembly of viral components to form progeny virions. for influenza a viruses, the matrix m1 protein and two membrane integral glycoproteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, function cooperatively in this process. here, we asked whether another membrane protein, the m2 protein, plays a role in virus assembly. the m2 protein, comprising 97 amino acids, possesses the longest cytoplasmic tail (54 residues) of the three transmembrane proteins of influenza a viruses. we therefore generated a series of deletion mutants of the m2 cytoplasmic tail by reverse genetics. we found that mutants in which more than 22 amino acids were deleted from the carboxyl terminus of the m2 tail were viable but grew less efficiently than did the wild-type virus. an analysis of the virions suggested that viruses with m2 tail deletions of more than 22 carboxy-terminal residues apparently contained less viral ribonucleoprotein complex than did the wild-type virus. these m2 tail mutants also differ from the wild-type virus in their morphology: while the wild-type virus is spherical, some of the mutants were filamentous. alanine-scanning experiments further indicated that amino acids at positions 74 to 79 of the m2 tail play a role in virion morphogenesis and affect viral infectivity. we conclude that the m2 cytoplasmic domain of influenza a viruses plays an important role in viral assembly and morphogenesis.
seahorses, sea dragons and pipefishes of the teleost family syngnathidae are unique in that embryos develop within specialized brooding structures of the male. we enriched brooding syngnathus fuscus and syngnathus floridae males with injections of l-lysine-[15n2] and 16:0-palmitic acid 1-[13c] to demonstrate embryonic uptake of paternally-derived nutrients. while all embryos demonstrated amino acid enrichment, late stages showed significantly higher [15n], indicating greater utilization of paternal resources as yolk reserves diminished and embryonic energy demands increased. limited embryonic [13c] uptake, defined as less than 10% of adult enrichment, in 75 and 81% of s. floridae and s. fuscus respectively signified rapid lipid metabolism and thus the need for greater enrichment. interspecific differences in embryonic uptake of paternally-derived nutrients were not demonstrated. however, interspecific differences in egg nutrient reserves and fry size but comparable fry nutrient levels along with data from a published paternal exposure study indicate paternal transfer in s. fuscus most likely compensates for the comparative egg nutrient deficiency. this study is the first to our knowledge to provide direct evidence for the functional significance of the brood pouch in nutrient provisioning. these results add comparative information on the diversity of syngnathid paternal care and further our understanding of paternal influence on development. summary male seahorses and pipefishes of the family syngnathidae are heralded for their unique brood pouch structures for incubating embryos. there are three general types of brood pouch with increasing complexity: simple ventral gluing, two pouch flaps and a completely sealed sac. the diversity of functional roles within a type in providing nutrition, aeration and protection to offspring is unknown. here we reveal significant differences in parental nutrient allocation to embryos for two closely related, sympatric pipefishes with similar brood pouch structure. we document differences in embryo attachment, depletion of pouch fluid nutrients over development and egg nutrient partitioning between syngnathus floridae and syngnathus fuscus. in s. fuscus, females produce nutritionally poor eggs and the males implant developing embryos in the brood pouch adjacent to blood vessels. a female-biased breeding population was observed, supporting the hypothesis that the cost of male parental care is high in this species. the loose connection between eggs and brood pouch tissues and the appearance of undeveloped eggs and lipid droplets in the pouch of s. floridae males suggest this species utilizes nutrient-rich eggs produced by females as nurse eggs to supplement embryonic development. a balanced sex-ratio for s. floridae further supports more equal parental contribution. this comparison provides evidence of a decline in female gametic investment and reveals the rapid diversification of syngnathid brood pouch function. our results indicate gross classification of brooding structures into one of the three general pouch types does not predict the energetic investment of males in parental care. but rather, physiological characterization of the relative investment by each sex to offspring is essential to understanding the functional significance of the brood pouch.
aberrant expression of micrornas (mirnas), a class of small non-coding regulatory rnas, has been implicated in the development and progression of high-grade gliomas. however, the precise mechanistic role of many mirnas in this disease remains unclear. here, we investigate the functional role of mir-331-3p in glioblastoma multiforme (gbm). we found that mir-331-3p expression in gbm cell lines is significantly lower than in normal brain, and that transient overexpression of mir-331-3p inhibits gbm cell line proliferation and clonogenic growth, suggesting a possible tumor suppressor role for mir-331-3p in this system. bioinformatics analysis identified neuropilin-2 (nrp-2) as a putative target of mir-331-3p. using transfection studies, we validated nrp-2 mrna as a target of mir-331-3p in gbm cell lines, and show that nrp-2 expression is regulated by mir-331-3p. rna interference (rnai) to inhibit nrp-2 expression in vitro decreased the growth and clonogenic growth of gbm cell lines, providing further support for an oncogenic role for nrp-2 in high-grade gliomas. we also show that mir-331-3p inhibits gbm cell migration, an effect due in part to reduced nrp-2 expression. finally, we identified a significant inverse correlation between mir-331-3p and nrp-2 expression in the cancer genome atlas gbm cohort of 491 patients. together, our results suggest that a loss of mir-331-3p expression contributes to gbm development and progression, at least in part via upregulating nrp-2 expression and increasing cell proliferation and clonogenic growth. micrornas are small noncoding rnas that function by regulating target gene expression posttranscriptionally. they play a critical role in developmental and physiologic processes and are implicated in the pathogenesis of several human diseases including cancer. we examined the expression profiles of 241 human micrornas in normal tissues and the nci-60 panel of human tumor-derived cell lines. to quantify microrna expression, we employed a highly sensitive technique that uses stem-loop primers for reverse transcription followed by real-time pcr. most micrornas were expressed at lower levels in tumor-derived cell lines compared with the corresponding normal tissue. agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis of microrna expression revealed four groups among the nci-60 cell lines consisting of hematologic, colon, central nervous system, and melanoma tumor-derived cell lines clustered in a manner that reflected their tissue of origin. we identified specific subsets of micrornas that provide candidate molecular signatures characteristic of the tumor-derived cell lines belonging to these four clusters. we also identified specific microrna expression patterns that correlated with the proliferation indices of the nci-60 cell lines, and we developed evidence for the identification of specific micrornas as candidate oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in different tumor types. our results provide evidence that microrna expression patterns may mark specific biological characteristics of tumors and/or mediate biological activities important for the pathobiology of malignant tumors. these findings call attention to the potential of micrornas to provide etiologic insights as well as to serve as both diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for many different tumor types.
active 3d scene segmentation using kinectauthor: carlos hernandez matasabstract:this thesis takes as a starting point a segmentation framework for visual scenes based on markov random fields. the a ... this paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. the success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. these goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. we define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. a third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. we use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. on specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. with this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. the optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a gaussian-smoothed image. we extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. we present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.
objectives this investigation was designed 1) to assess whether the early diastolic velocity of the mitral annulus (ea) obtained with doppler tissue imaging (dti) behaves as a preload-independent index of left ventricular (lv) relaxation; and 2) to evaluate the relation of the mitral e/ea ratio to lv filling pressures.   background recent observations suggest that ea is an index of lv relaxation that is less influenced by lv filling pressures.   methods one hundred twenty-five study subjects were classified into three groups according to mitral e/a ratio, lv ejection fraction (lvef) and clinical symptoms: 34 asymptomatic subjects with a normal lvef and an e/a ratio > or =1; 40 with a normal lvef, an e/a ratio <1 and no heart failure symptoms (impaired relaxation [ir]); and 51 with heart failure symptoms and an e/a ratio >1 (pseudonormal [pn]). ea was derived from the lateral border of the annulus. a subset of 60 patients had invasive measurement of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (pcwp) simultaneous with doppler echocardiographic dti.   results ea was reduced in the ir and pn groups compared with the group of normal subjects: 5.8 +/- 1.5 and 5.2 +/- 1.4 vs. 12 +/- 2.8 cm/s, respectively (p < 0.001). mean pcwp (20 +/- 8 mm hg) related weakly to mitral e (r = 0.68) but not to ea. the e/ea ratio related well to pcwp (r = 0.87; pcwp = 1.24 [e/ea] + 1.9), with a difference between doppler and catheter measurements of 0.1 +/- 3.8 mm hg.   conclusions ea behaves as a preload-independent index of lv relaxation. mitral e velocity, corrected for the influence of relaxation (i.e., the e/ea ratio), relates well to mean pcwp and may be used to estimate lv filling pressures. left atrial (la) volume measurements have been made by the application of the method of discs (modified simpson's rule) to orthogonal biplane atrial echocardiographic images. validation of the technique has been suboptimal due to deficiencies of the reference standard, levophase angiography. to define the accuracy of echocardiography, we compared la end-systolic volume by echocardiography in 27 patients with volumes by cine computed tomography (cine ct), a highly accurate and validated method of measuring cardiac chambers. echocardiographic tracings were made in the apical long-axis two- and four-chamber views. in patients with atria less than 300 ml, 14 had echoes performed prospectively, with optimization of la size, while the remaining 10 were analyzed retrospectively. the volume of each slice was calculated and was then summated to obtain total volume. the correlation coefficient between two-dimensional echocardiography and cine ct was r = 0.98, and it was r = 0.82 when patients with atria greater than 300 ml (n = 3) were excluded. echocardiography underestimated cine ct measurements by 23%. the slope of the prospective group was closer to unity than the slope of the retrospective group (p less than 0.001), and the correlation with cine ct was slightly better for the prospective group (r = 0.88 versus r = 0.77). la volume by two-dimensional echocardiography correlates closely with cine ct, a more accurate method of volume determination, and gives valid measurements of la volume. efforts to maximize la size during scanning limit inaccuracies of echocardiographic measurements of the left atrium.
objectives this study was performed to evaluate the frequency and risk factors associated with new aortal lesions induced by surgical manipulation and their correlation with postoperative stroke.   background little is known about the causative mechanism of intraoperative atheroembolism after cardiac surgery.   methods epiaortic echocardiography was performed before cannulation and after decannulation in 472 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation.   results a new lesion in the ascending aortal intima was identified in 16 patients (3.4%) after decannulation. new lesions were severe, with mobile lesions or disruption of the intima in 10 patients. six of the severe lesions were related to aortic damping and the other four to aortic cannulation. three patients in this group had postoperative stroke. univariate analysis identified only the maximal thickness of the atheroma near the aorta manipulation site as a predictor of new lesions. the incidence of new lesions was 11.8% if the atheroma was approximately 3 to 4 mm thick and as high as 33.3% if the atheroma was >4 mm, but only 0.8% when it was <3 mm. total 10 patients (2.1%) sustained neurological complications. arteriosclerosis obliterans, atherosclerosis of the aorta and new mobile lesions were identified as predictors of strokes.   conclusions this study demonstrated an association between new lesions created by surgical maneuvers and postoperative stroke. embolic strokes were more likely to occur if new lesions were complicated with intimal disruption, especially of the mobile type. modifications in surgical procedures will be needed if thick plaque (especially >4 mm) is noted near the manipulation site. background to further gain insight into atheroembolization mechanisms epiaortic two-dimensional echocardiographic evaluation before extracorporeal circulation and after decannulation may be helpful.   methods epiaortic two-dimensional echocardiography was performed before cannulation and after decannulation in 188 (124 men) patients (mean age, 67.7 years; range, 43 to 86 years) undergoing operation with extracorporeal circulation for ischemic heart disease during 1996.   results after decannulation, a new intimal lesion was recognized in 10 of 188 patients (5.3%): mobile type in 5 patients (3 ending with a stroke [60%], 2 having brain computed tomographic scans compatible with embolism), intimal tear in 2, and intimal irregularity in 3 patients. stroke occurred in a significantly smaller number of patients (2 of 178 [1.1%]; p < 0.001) without new lesions.   conclusions clamp- or cannula-induced new lesions, especially of mobile type, are often complicated by postoperative stroke. aggressive surgical technique modifications may need to be considered to avoid creating new lesions, particularly of the mobile type.
cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) and p-glycoprotein (p-gp) are atp-binding cassette (abc) transporters that have two transmembrane domains (tmds) and two nucleotide-binding domains (nbds). defective folding of cftr lacking phenylalanine 508 (δphe508) in nbd1 is the most common cause of cystic fibrosis. the phe508 position seems to be universally important in abc transporters because deletion of the equivalent residue (tyr490) in p-gp also inhibits maturation of the protein. the pharmacological chaperone vrt-325 can repair the δphe508-type folding defects in p-gp or cftr. vrt-325 may repair the folding defects by promoting dimerization of the two nbds or by promoting folding of the tmds. to distinguish between these two mechanisms, we tested the ability of vrt-325 to promote folding of truncation mutants lacking one or both nbds. sensitivity to glycosidases was used as an indirect indicator of folding. it was found that vrt-325 could promote maturation of truncation mutants lacking nbd2. truncation mutants of cftr or p-gp lacking both nbds showed deficiencies in core-glycosylation that could be partially reversed by carrying out expression in the presence of vrt-325. the results show that dimerization of the two nbds to form a “nucleotide-sandwich” structure or nbd interactions with the tmds are not essential for vrt-325 enhancement of folding. instead, vrt-325 can promote folding of the tmds alone. the ability of vrt-325 to promote core-glycosylation of the nbd-less truncation mutants suggests that one mechanism whereby the compound enhances folding is by promoting proper insertion of tm segments attached to the glycosylated loops so that they adopt an orientation favorable for glycosylation. the most common cause of cystic fibrosis (cf) is deletion of phenylalanine 508 (deltaf508) in the cf transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) chloride channel. the deltaf508 mutation produces defects in folding, stability, and channel gating. to identify small-molecule correctors of defective cellular processing, we assayed iodide flux in deltaf508-cftr-transfected epithelial cells using a fluorescent halide indicator. screening of 150,000 chemically diverse compounds and more than 1,500 analogs of active compounds yielded several classes of deltaf508-cftr correctors (aminoarylthiazoles, quinazolinylaminopyrimidinones, and bisaminomethylbithiazoles) with micromolar potency that produced greater apical membrane chloride current than did low-temperature rescue. correction was seen within 3-6 hours and persisted for more than 12 hours after washout. functional correction was correlated with plasma membrane expression of complex-glycosylated deltaf508-cftr protein. biochemical studies suggested a mechanism of action involving improved deltaf508-cftr folding at the er and stability at the cell surface. the bisaminomethylbithiazoles corrected deltaf508-cftr in deltaf508/deltaf508 human bronchial epithelia but did not correct a different temperature-sensitive cftr mutant (p574h-cftr) or a dopamine receptor mutant. small-molecule correctors may be useful in the treatment of cf caused by the deltaf508 mutation.
it has been suggested that atypicalities in low‐level visual processing contribute to the expression and development of the unusual cognitive and behavioral profile seen in autism spectrum disorders (asd). however, previous investigations have yielded mixed results. in the largest study of its kind (asd n = 89; non‐asd = 52; mean age 15 years 6 months) and testing across the spectrum of iq (range 52–133), we investigated performance on three measures of basic visual processing: motion coherence, form‐from‐motion and biological motion (bm). at the group level, we found no evidence of differences between the two groups on any of the tasks, suggesting that there is no fundamental visual motion processing deficit in individuals with an asd, at least by adolescence. however, we identified a tail of individuals with asd (18% of the sample) who had exceptionally poor bm processing abilities compared to the non‐asd group, and who were characterized by low iq. for the entire sample of those both with and without asd, performance on the bm task uniquely correlated with performance on the frith–happé animations, a higher‐level task that demands the interpretation of moving, interacting agents in order to understand mental states. we hypothesize that this association reflects the shared social–cognitive characteristics of the two tasks, which have a common neural underpinning in the superior temporal sulcus. autism res 2011,4:347–357. © 2011 international society for autism research, wiley periodicals, inc. the autism diagnostic observation schedule—generic (ados-g) is a semistructured, standardized assessment of social interaction, communication, play, and imaginative use of materials for individuals suspected of having autism spectrum disorders. the observational schedule consists of four 30-minute modules, each designed to be administered to different individuals according to their level of expressive language. psychometric data are presented for 223 children and adults with autistic disorder (autism), pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (pddnos) or nonspectrum diagnoses. within each module, diagnostic groups were equivalent on expressive language level. results indicate substantial interrater and test—retest reliability for individual items, excellent interrater reliability within domains and excellent internal consistency. comparisons of means indicated consistent differentiation of autism and pddnos from nonspectrum individuals, with some, but less consistent, differentiation of autism from pddnos. a priori operationalization of dsm-iv/icd-10 criteria, factor analyses, and roc curves were used to generate diagnostic algorithms with thresholds set for autism and broader autism spectrum/pdd. algorithm sensitivities and specificities for autism and pddnos relative to nonspectrum disorders were excellent, with moderate differentiation of autism from pddnos.
in serbian, lexical decision latencies to words composed of letters that   exist in both the roman and cyrillic alphabets (some of which have different   phonemic interpretations in each) are slower than for the unique alphabet   transcription of those same words. in this study, we use the effect of   phonological ambiguity to explore the time course of semantic facilitation.   targets are either the phonologically ambiguous forms (e.g., petak meaning   “friday” when pronounced as a roman string /petak/ but without meaning when   pronounced in cyrillic as /retak/) or the unique alphabet transcription of   the same word (пetak). we manipulate alphabet match and semantic relatedness   of prime to target. in addition to replicating slowing due to phonological   ambiguity, we show 1) greater alphabet switch cost for bivalent then for   unambiguous targets as well as for unrelated then for related prime-target   pairs and 2) greater semantic facilitation as the number of shared common   letters between prime and target increases. results reveal the interaction of   phonological and semantic processes in serbian. the findings are discussed in   terms of a triangle model of language processing, which hypothesizes a   division of labor between an orthography-to-semantics, and an   orthographyto-phonology-to-semantics route and their simultaneous   contribution to activation of meaning. reaction times (rts) are an important source of information in experimental psychology. classical methodological considerations pertaining to the statistical analysis of rt data are optimized for analyses of aggregated data, based on subject or item means (c.f., forster & dickinson, 1976). mixed-effects modeling (see, e.g., baayen, davidson, & bates, 2008) does not require prior aggregation and allows the researcher the more ambitious goal of predicting individual responses. mixed-modeling calls for a reconsideration of the classical methodological strategies for analysing rts. in this study, we argue for empirical exibility with respect to the choice of transformation for the rts. we advocate minimal a-priori data trimming, combined with model criticism. we also show how trial-to-trial, longitudinal dependencies between individual observations can be brought into the statistical model. these strategies are illustrated for a large dataset with a non-trivial random-effects structure. special attention is paid to the evaluation of interactions involving fixed-effect factors that partition the levels sampled by random-effect factors.
expression of the recombinant human excitatory amino aid transporters, eaat1 and eaat2, in xenopus laevis oocytes allows electrogenic transport to be studied under voltage clamp conditions. we have investigated the transport of the pharmacological substrate, l‐serine‐o‐sulphate transport by eaat1 and eaat2. the ec50 values for l‐serine‐o‐sulphate transport by eaat2 showed a steep voltage‐dependence, increasing from 152±11 μm at −100 mv to 1930±160 μm at 0 mv. in contrast to eaat2, ec50 values for l‐serine‐o‐sulphate transport by eaat1 were relatively constant over the membrane potential range of −100 mv to 0 mv. the ec50 values for l‐glutamate and d‐aspartate transport, by eaat2, were also relatively constant over this membrane potential range. chloride ions modulated the voltage‐dependent changes in ec50 values for transport by eaat2. this effect was most apparent for l‐serine‐o‐sulphate transport, and to a lesser extent for l‐glutamate and not at all for d‐aspartate transport by eaat2. extracellular sodium and proton concentrations also modulated the voltage‐dependence of l‐serine‐o‐sulphate ec50 values for eaat2. we speculate that these different properties of l‐serine‐o‐sulphate transport by eaat2 compared to other substrates may be due to the much stronger acidity of the sulphate group of l‐serine‐o‐sulphate compared to carboxyl groups of l‐glutamate or d‐aspartate. these results highlight some of the differences in the way different glutamate transporter subtypes transport substrates. this may be used to understand further the transport process and develop subtype selective inhibitors of glutamate transport. reuptake plays an important role in regulating synaptic and extracellular concentrations of glutamate. three glutamate transporters expressed in human motor cortex, termed eaat1, eaat2, and eaat3 (for excitatory amino acid transporter), have been characterized by their molecular cloning and functional expression. each eaat subtype mrna was found in all human brain regions analyzed. the most prominent regional variation in message content was in cerebellum where eaat1 expression predominated. eaat1 and eaat3 mrnas were also expressed in various non- nervous tissues, whereas expression of eaat2 was largely restricted to brain. the kinetic parameters and pharmacological characteristics of transport mediated by each eaat subtype were determined in transfected mammalian cells by radio-label uptake and in microinjected oocytes by voltage-clamp measurements. the affinities of the eaat subtypes for l- glutamate were similar, with km determinations varying from 48 to 97 microm in the mammalian cell assay and from 18 to 28 microm in oocytes. glutamate uptake inhibitors were used to compare the pharmacologies of the eaat subtypes. the eaat2 subtype was distinguishable from the eaat1/eaat3 subtypes by the potency of several inhibitors, but most notably by sensitivity to kainic acid (ka) and dihydrokainic acid (dhk). ka and dhk potently inhibited eaat2 transport, but did not significantly affect transport by eaat1/eaat3. using voltage-clamp measurements, most inhibitors were found to be substrates that elicited transport currents. in contrast, ka and dhk did not evoke currents and they were found to block eaat2-mediated transport competitively. this selective interaction with the eaat2 subtype could be a significant factor in ka neurotoxicity. these studies provide a foundation for understanding the role of glutamate transporters in human excitatory neurotransmission and in neuropathology.
backgroundcomparative genomics is a powerful approach for studying variation in physiological traits as well as the evolution and ecology of microorganisms. recent technological advances have enabled sequencing large numbers of related genomes in a single project, requiring computational tools for their integrated analysis. in particular, accurate annotations and identification of gene presence and absence are critical for understanding and modeling the cellular physiology of newly sequenced genomes. although many tools are available to compare the gene contents of related genomes, new tools are necessary to enable close examination and curation of protein families from large numbers of closely related organisms, to integrate curation with the analysis of gain and loss, and to generate metabolic networks linking the annotations to observed phenotypes.resultswe have developed itep, an integrated toolkit for exploration of microbial pan-genomes, to curate protein families, compute similarities to externally-defined domains, analyze gene gain and loss, and generate draft metabolic networks from one or more curated reference network reconstructions in groups of related microbial species among which the combination of core and variable genes constitute the their "pan-genomes". the itep toolkit consists of: (1) a series of modular command-line scripts for identification, comparison, curation, and analysis of protein families and their distribution across many genomes; (2) a set of python libraries for programmatic access to the same data; and (3) pre-packaged scripts to perform common analysis workflows on a collection of genomes. itep’s capabilities include de novo protein family prediction, ortholog detection, analysis of functional domains, identification of core and variable genes and gene regions, sequence alignments and tree generation, annotation curation, and the integration of cross-genome analysis and metabolic networks for study of metabolic network evolution.conclusionsitep is a powerful, flexible toolkit for generation and curation of protein families. itep's modular design allows for straightforward extension as analysis methods and tools evolve. by integrating comparative genomics with the development of draft metabolic networks, itep harnesses the power of comparative genomics to build confidence in links between genotype and phenotype and helps disambiguate gene annotations when they are evaluated in both evolutionary and metabolic network contexts. a discrete uncoupling process for finite spaces is introduced, called the markov cluster process or the mcl process. the process is the engine for the graph clustering algorithm called the mcl algorithm. the mcl process takes a stochastic matrix as input, and then alternates expansion and inflation, each step defining a stochastic matrix in terms of the previous one. expansion corresponds with taking the $k$th power of a stochastic matrix, where $k\in\n$. inflation corresponds with a parametrized operator $\gamma_r$, $r\geq 0$, that maps the set of (column) stochastic matrices onto itself. the image $\gamma_r m$ is obtained by raising each entry in $m$ to the $r$th power and rescaling each column to have sum 1 again. in practice the process converges very fast towards a limit that is invariant under both matrix multiplication and inflation, with quadratic convergence around the limit points. the heuristic behind the process is its expected behavior for (markov) graphs possessing cluster structure. the process is typically applied to the matrix of random walks on a given graph $g$, and the connected components of (the graph associated with) the process limit generically allow a clustering interpretation of $g$. the limit is in general extremely sparse and iterands are sparse in a weighted sense, implying that the mcl algorithm is very fast and highly scalable. several mathematical properties of the mcl process are established. most notably, the process (and algorithm) iterands posses structural properties generalizing the mapping from process limits onto clusterings. the inflation operator $\gamma_r$ maps the class of matrices that are diagonally similar to a symmetric matrix onto itself. the phrase diagonally positive semi-definite (dpsd) is used for matrices that are diagonally similar to a positive semi-definite matrix. for $r\in\n$ and for $m$ a stochastic dpsd matrix, the image $\gamma_r m$ is again dpsd. determinantal inequalities satisfied by a dpsd matrix $m$ imply a natural ordering among the diagonal elements of $m$, generalizing the mapping of process limits onto clusterings. the spectrum of $\gamma_{\infty} m$ is of the form $\{0^{n-k}, 1^k\}$, where $k$ is the number of endclasses of the ordering associated with $m$, and $n$ is the dimension of $m$. this attests to the uncoupling effect of the inflation operator.
we present a new model for acquiring comprehensive multiword lexicons from large corpora based on competition among n-gram candidates. in contrast to the standard approach of simple ranking by association measure, in our model n-grams are arranged in a lattice structure based on subsumption and overlap relationships, with nodes inhibiting other nodes in their vicinity when they are selected as a lexical item. we show how the configuration of such a lattice can be optimized tractably, and demonstrate using annotations of sampled n-grams that our method consistently outperforms alternatives by at least 0.05 f-score across several corpora and languages. multiword expressions (mwes) are quite frequent in languages such as english, but their diversity, the scarcity of individual mwe types, and contextual ambiguity have presented obstacles to corpus-based studies and nlp systems addressing them as a class. here we advocate for a comprehensive annotation approach: proceeding sentence by sentence, our annotators manually group tokens into mwes according to guidelines that cover a broad range of multiword phenomena. under this scheme, we have fully annotated an english web corpus for multiword expressions, including those containing gaps.
predicting protein fractions and coagulation properties in bovine milk using fourier transform infrared (ft-ir) measurements is desirable. however, such predictions may rely on correlations with total protein content. the aim of this study was to show how correlations between total protein content, protein fractions, and coagulation properties are responsible for the successful prediction of protein fractions and rennet-induced coagulation properties in milk samples. this study comprised 832 bovine milk samples from 2 breeds (426 holstein and 406 jersey). holstein samples were collected from 20 danish dairy herds from october to december 2009; jersey samples were collected from 22 danish dairy herds from february to april 2010. all samples were from conventional herds and taken while cows were housed. the results showed that κ-cn, αs1-cn, αs1-cn with 8 phosphorylated groups attached (αs1-cn 8p), and curd firming rate could be predicted from ft-ir measurements of the milk samples (with coefficients of determination between 0.66 and 0.71). however, the success of these ft-ir-based predictions was based on indirect relationships with total protein content. hence, the ft-ir predictions relied on covariance structures with total protein content rather than absorption bands directly associated with the protein fractions and coagulation properties. if covariance structures between the protein fractions, coagulation properties, and total protein content used to calibrate partial least squares models were not conserved in future samples, these samples would show incorrect predictions of the protein fractions and coagulation properties. we demonstrated this using samples from 1 breed to calibrate and samples from the other breed to validate partial least squares models for β-cn. the 2 breeds had different covariance structures between β-cn and total protein content, and the validation samples yielded incorrect predictions. this finding may limit the usefulness of ft-ir-based predictions of protein fractions in milk recording, because indirect covariance structures in the calibration set must be valid for future samples, or future samples will show incorrect predictions. the objective of this study was to examine variation in overall milk, protein, and mineral composition of bovine milk in relation to rennet-induced coagulation, with the aim of elucidating the underlying causes of milk with impaired coagulation abilities. on the basis of an initial screening of 892 milk samples from 42 herds with danish jersey and holstein-friesian cows, a subset of 102 samples was selected to represent milk with good, poor, or noncoagulating properties (i.e., samples that within each breed represented the most extremes in regard to coagulation properties). milk with good coagulation characteristics was defined as milk forming a strong coagulum based on oscillatory rheology, as indicated by high values for maximum coagulum strength (g'(max)) and curd firming rate (cfr) and a short rennet coagulation time. poorly coagulating milk formed a weak coagulum, with a low g'(max) and cfr and a long rennet coagulation time. noncoagulating milk was defined as milk that failed to form a coagulum, having g'(max) and cfr values of zero at measurements taken within 1h after addition of rennet. for both breeds, a lower content of total protein, total casein (cn) and κ-cn, and lower levels of minerals (ca, p, mg) were identified in poorly coagulating and noncoagulating milk in comparison with milk with good coagulation properties. liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry revealed the presence of a great variety of genetic variants of the major milk proteins, namely, α(s1)-cn (variants b and c), α(s2)-cn (a), β-cn (a(1), a(2), b, i, and f), κ-cn (a, b, and e), α-lactalbumin (b), and β-lactoglobulin (a, b, and c). in poorly coagulating and noncoagulating milk samples of both breeds, the predominant composite genotype of α(s1)-, β-, and κ-cn was bb-a(2)a(2)-aa, which confirmed a genetic contribution to impaired milk coagulation. interestingly, subtle variations in posttranslational modification of cn were observed between the coagulation classes in both breeds. poorly coagulating and noncoagulating milk contained a lower fraction of the least phosphorylated α(s1)-cn form, α(s1)-cn 8p, relative to total α(s1)-cn, along with a lower fraction of glycosylated κ-cn relative to total κ-cn. thus, apparent variation was observed in the milk and protein composition, in the genetic makeup of the major milk proteins, and in the posttranslational modification level of cn between milk samples with either good or impaired coagulation ability, whereas the composition of poorly coagulating and noncoagulating milk was similar.
objectivesthe study aimed to review the etiologies of patients who underwent surgery for small bowel obstruction (sbo) and to evaluate the risk factors affecting the early postoperative outcomes.materials and methodsa case series of 430 patients (252 men) with a mean age of 64.5 years, who underwent 437 operations for sbo, were retrospectively reviewed.resultsperitoneal adhesions and hernia were the most common causes of sbo, contributing 42.3 and 26.8% of all cases, respectively. strangulation occurred in 27.7% and caused nonviable bowel in 13.0% of obstructing episodes. old age (age ≥ 70 years), female patient, nonadhesive obstruction, and hernia were the independent significant factors associated with bowel strangulation. the 30-day mortality was 6.5%, and the median postoperative hospital stay was 8 days. old age, the presence of premorbid pulmonary disease, and malignant obstruction were the independent factors associated with operative mortality. the overall complication rate was 35.5%, and old age was the only significant factor associated with postoperative complications.conclusionssurgery for sbo is still associated with significant mortality and morbidity. as old age is significantly associated with an increased incidence of strangulation, operative mortality, and complications, this group of patients should be managed with extra cautions to avoid unfavorable outcome of surgery. aim gastrografin is a hyperosmolar water-soluble contrast medium. besides its predictive value for the need for operative treatment, a potential therapeutic role of this agent in adhesive small bowel obstruction has been suggested. this study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of gastrografin in adhesive small bowel obstruction when conservative treatment failed.   methods patients with adhesive small bowel obstruction were given trial conservative treatment unless there was fear of bowel strangulation. those responded in the initial 48 h had conservative treatment continued. patients who showed no improvement in the initial 48 h were given 100 ml of gastrografin through nasogastric tube followed by serial abdominal radiographs. patients with the contrast appeared in large bowel within 24 h were regarded as having partial obstruction and conservative treatment was continued. patients in which the contrast failed to reach large bowel within 24 h were considered to have complete obstruction and laparotomy was performed.   results two hundred and twelve patients with 245 episodes of adhesive obstruction were included. fifteen patients were operated on soon after admission due to fear of strangulation. one hundred and eighty-six episodes of obstruction showed improvement in the initial 48 h and conservative treatment was continued. two patients had subsequent operations because of persistent obstruction. forty-four episodes of obstruction showed no improvement within 48 h and gastrografin was administered. seven patients underwent complete obstruction surgery. partial obstruction was demonstrated in 37 other cases, obstruction resolved subsequently in all of them except one patient who required laparotomy because of persistent obstruction. the overall operative rate in this study was 10%. there was no complication that could be attributed to the use of gastrografin.   conclusion the use of gastrografin in adhesive small bowel obstruction after unsuccessful conservative treatment is safe and reduces the need for surgical intervention.
multi-scale data which contains structures at different scales of size and density is a big challenge for spectral clustering. even given a suitable locally scaled affinity matrix, the first k eigenvectors of such a matrix still cannot separate clusters well. thus, in this paper, we exploit the fusion of the cluster-separation information from all eigenvectors to achieve a better clustering result. our method full spectral clustering (fuse) is based on power iteration (pi) and independent component analysis (ica). pi is used to fuse all eigenvectors to one pseudo-eigenvector which inherits all the cluster-separation information. to conquer the cluster-collision problem, we utilize pi to generate p (p > k) pseudo-eigenvectors. since these pseudo-eigenvectors are redundant and the cluster-separation information is contaminated with noise, ica is adopted to rotate the pseudo-eigenvectors to make them pairwise statistically independent. to let ica overcome local optima and speed up the search process, we develop a self-adaptive and self-learning greedy search method. finally, we select k rotated pseudo-eigenvectors (independent components) which have more cluster-separation information measured by kurtosis for clustering. various synthetic and real-world data verifies the effectiveness and efficiency of our fuse method. despite many empirical successes of spectral clustering methods— algorithms that cluster points using eigenvectors of matrices derived from the data—there are several unresolved issues. first. there are a wide variety of algorithms that use the eigenvectors in slightly different ways. second, many of these algorithms have no proof that they will actually compute a reasonable clustering. in this paper, we present a simple spectral clustering algorithm that can be implemented using a few lines of matlab. using tools from matrix perturbation theory, we analyze the algorithm, and give conditions under which it can be expected to do well. we also show surprisingly good experimental results on a number of challenging clustering problems.
cascade classifiers are widely used in real-time object detection. different from conventional classifiers that are designed for a low overall classification error rate, a classifier in each node of the cascade is required to achieve an extremely high detection rate and moderate false positive rate. although there are a few reported methods addressing this requirement in the context of object detection, there is no principled feature selection method that explicitly takes into account this asymmetric node learning objective. we provide such an algorithm here. we show that a special case of the biased minimax probability machine has the same formulation as the linear asymmetric classifier (lac) of wu et al. (linear asymmetric classifier for cascade detectors, 2005). we then design a new boosting algorithm that directly optimizes the cost function of lac. the resulting totally-corrective boosting algorithm is implemented by the column generation technique in convex optimization. experimental results on object detection verify the effectiveness of the proposed boosting algorithm as a node classifier in cascade object detection, and show performance better than that of the current state-of-the-art. pedestrian detection is a key problem in computer vision, with several applications that have the potential to positively impact quality of life. in recent years, the number of approaches to detecting pedestrians in monocular images has grown steadily. however, multiple data sets and widely varying evaluation protocols are used, making direct comparisons difficult. to address these shortcomings, we perform an extensive evaluation of the state of the art in a unified framework. we make three primary contributions: 1) we put together a large, well-annotated, and realistic monocular pedestrian detection data set and study the statistics of the size, position, and occlusion patterns of pedestrians in urban scenes, 2) we propose a refined per-frame evaluation methodology that allows us to carry out probing and informative comparisons, including measuring performance in relation to scale and occlusion, and 3) we evaluate the performance of sixteen pretrained state-of-the-art detectors across six data sets. our study allows us to assess the state of the art and provides a framework for gauging future efforts. our experiments show that despite significant progress, performance still has much room for improvement. in particular, detection is disappointing at low resolutions and for partially occluded pedestrians.
several of the most important conservation prioritization approaches select markedly different areas at global and regional scales. they are designed to maximize a certain biodiversity dimension such as coverage of species in the case of hotspots and complementarity, or composite properties of ecosystems in the case of wilderness. most comparisons between approaches have ignored the multidimensionality of biodiversity. we analyze here the results of two species-based methodologies—hotspots and complementarity—and an ecosystem-based methodology—wilderness—at local scale. as zoning of protected areas can increase the effectiveness of conservation, we use the data employed for the management plan of the peneda-gerês national park in portugal. we compare the approaches against four criteria: species representativeness, wilderness coverage, coverage of important areas for megafauna, and for regulating ecosystem services. our results suggest that species- and ecosystem-based approaches select significantly different areas at local scale. our results also show that no approach covers well all biodiversity dimensions. species-based approaches cover species distribution better, while the ecosystem-based approach favors wilderness, areas important for megafauna, and for ecosystem services. management actions addressing different dimensions of biodiversity have a potential for contradictory effects, social conflict, and ecosystem services trade-offs, especially in the context of current european biodiversity policies. however, biodiversity is multidimensional, and management and zoning at local level should reflect this aspect. the consideration of both species- and ecosystem-based approaches at local scale is necessary to achieve a wider range of conservation goals. marxan is software that delivers decision support for reserve system design. marxan was initially designed to solve a particular class of reserve design problems known as the minimum set problem (see box 1.1) where the goal is to achieve some minimum representation of biodiversity features for the smallest possible cost. marxan helps users to determine the possible contribution of individual areas and whole networks towards meeting their objectives. users may use marxan to explore and propose possible network configurations, to facilitate collaborative network design, or to guide their own land acquisition / marine zoning. marxan is not designed to act as a stand-alone reserve design solution. its effectiveness is dependent upon the involvement of people, the adoption of sound ecological principles, the establishment of scientifically defensible conservation goals and targets and the construction of spatial datasets. marxan should be used as part of a systematic conservation planning process (outlined in this chapter) and in collaboration with other forms of knowledge. these other forms of knowledge are essential to the refinement of marxan inputs, the interpretation of marxan outcomes and the precise placement of final reserve boundaries. because it seeks spatially efficient solutions, based on a defined problem, marxan represents a significant step forward from earlier approaches of scoring sites. nonetheless, there is a significant amount of uncertainty in selecting sites, which is but one aspect of systematic conservation planning, the final step of which is monitoring to evaluate whether the sites make meaningful contributions to the network. 1.1 overview of systematic conservation planning 1.1.1 what is systematic conservation planning? world-leading conservation planning processes, both marine and terrestrial, are employing an approach known as systematic conservation planning (pressey et al. 1993, noss and cooperrider 1994, davey 1998, pressey 1999, margules and pressey 2000, groves 2003, noss 2003, leslie 2005). systematic conservation planning focuses on locating, designing and managing protected areas that comprehensively represent the biodiversity of each region (mace et al. 2006). this approach to planning involves
constraint tightening to non-conservatively guarantee recursive feasibility and stability in stochastic model predictive control is addressed. stability and feasibility requirements are considered separately, highlighting the difference between existence of a solution and feasibility of a suitable, a priori known candidate solution. subsequently, a stochastic model predictive control algorithm which unifies previous results is derived, leaving the designer the option to balance an increased feasible region against guaranteed bounds on the asymptotic average performance and convergence time. besides typical performance bounds, under mild assumptions, we prove asymptotic stability in probability of the minimal robust positively invariant set obtained by the unconstrained lq-optimal controller. a numerical example, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed approach in comparison with classical, recursively feasible stochastic mpc and robust mpc, is provided. predictive regulation of linear discrete-time systems subject to unknown but bounded disturbances and to state/control constraints is addressed. an algorithm based on constraint restrictions is presented and its stability properties are analysed.
objective the aim of this study was to investigate, in an unselected sample of patients with guillain-barré syndrome in sweden, the utilization of healthcare resources, satisfaction with these resources, informal help and the burden of care on family caregivers during the first 2 years after onset.   subjects forty-four patients were enrolled from 8 hospitals, and 42 of them were followed for 2 years.   methods data on the utilization of hospital inpatient and outpatient care, primary care and community-based services were collected via computerized registry information, medical records and a specific protocol. patient satisfaction and the burden on family caregivers were studied using questionnaires.   results forty-one patients required inpatient hospitalization for a mean of 82 days. patients with persistent dependency during activities of daily living had significantly longer hospital stays and more days of outpatient rehabilitation. the majority of patients were satisfied with their care, but dissatisfaction was found regarding information and finances. at 2 years after onset, 26% of patients still depended on informal help. the spouses expressed increased concern and responsibility for household and family.   conclusion patients with persistent disability due to guillain-barré syndrome were found to have long-term need for services from the healthcare system and informal help. gottberg k, einarsson u, fredrikson s, von koch l, widén holmqvist l. multiple sclerosis in stockholm county. a pilot study of utilization of health‐care resources, patient satisfaction with care and impact on family caregivers.
atopic dermatitis (ad) is a widely spread cutaneous chronic disease characterised by sensitive reactions (eg. eczema) to normally innocuous elements. although relatively little is understood about its underlying mechanisms due to its complexity, skin barrier dysfunction has been recognised as a key factor in the development of ad. skin barrier homeostasis requires tight control of the activity of proteases, called kallikreins (klks), whose activity is regulated by a complex network of protein interactions that remains poorly understood despite its pathological importance. characteristic symptoms of ad include the outbreak of inflammation triggered by external (eg. mechanical and chemical) stimulus and the persistence and aggravation of inflammation even if the initial stimulus disappears. these characteristic symptoms, together with some experimental data, suggest the presence of positive feedback regulation for klk activity by inflammatory signals. we developed simple mathematical models for the klk activation system to study the effects of feedback loops and carried out bifurcation analysis to investigate the model behaviours corresponding to inflammation caused by external stimulus. the model analysis confirmed that the hypothesised core model mechanisms capture the essence of inflammation outbreak by a defective skin barrier. our models predicted the outbreaks of inflammation at weaker stimulus and its longer persistence in ad patients compared to healthy control. we also proposed a novel quantitative indicator for inflammation level by applying principal component analysis to microarray data. the model analysis reproduced qualitative ad characteristics revealed by this indicator. our results strongly implicate the presence and importance of feedback mechanisms in klk activity regulation. we further proposed future experiments that may provide informative data to enhance the system-level understanding on the regulatory mechanisms of skin barrier in ad and healthy individuals. apoptosis is an important physiological process crucially involved in development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms. although the major signaling pathways have been unraveled, a detailed mechanistic understanding of the complex underlying network remains elusive. we have translated here the current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of the death-receptor-activated caspase cascade into a mathematical model. a reduction down to the apoptotic core machinery enables the application of analytical mathematical methods to evaluate the system behavior within a wide range of parameters. using parameter values from the literature, the model reveals an unstable status of survival indicating the need for further control. based on recent publications we tested one additional regulatory mechanism at the level of initiator caspase activation and demonstrated that the resulting system displays desired characteristics such as bistability. in addition, the results from our model studies allowed us to reconcile the fast kinetics of caspase 3 activation observed at the single cell level with the much slower kinetics found at the level of a cell population.
helminth parasites can cause considerable damage when migrating through host tissues, thus making rapid tissue repair imperative to prevent bleeding and bacterial dissemination particularly during enteric infection. however, how protective type 2 responses targeted against these tissue-disruptive multicellular parasites might contribute to homeostatic wound healing in the intestine has remained unclear. here, we observed that mice lacking antibodies (aid-/-) or activating fc receptors (fcrg-/-) displayed impaired intestinal repair following infection with the murine helminth heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri (hpb), whilst transfer of immune serum could partially restore chemokine production and rescue wound healing in aid-/- mice. impaired healing was associated with a reduced expression of cxcr2 ligands (cxcl2/3) by macrophages (mφ) and myofibroblasts (mf) within intestinal lesions. whilst antibodies and helminths together triggered cxcl2 production by mφ in vitro via surface fcr engagement, chemokine secretion by intestinal mf was elicited by helminths directly via fcrg-chain/dectin2 signaling. blockade of cxcr2 during hpb challenge infection reproduced the delayed wound repair observed in helminth infected aid-/- and fcrg-/- mice. finally, conditioned media from human mφ stimulated with infective larvae of the helminth ascaris suum together with immune serum, promoted cxcr2-dependent scratch wound closure by human mf in vitro. collectively our findings suggest that helminths and antibodies instruct a chemokine driven mφ-mf crosstalk to promote intestinal repair, a capacity that may be harnessed in clinical settings of impaired wound healing. because abnormalities of mucosal immunity have been suggested in human iga nephropathy, we examined the involvement of mucosal immunity in iga deposition to the kidney in hyper iga (higa) mice, which was established as a mouse model for human iga nephropathy with hyperserum iga. the number of surface iga+b220− lymphocytes in the intestinal lamina propria (lp) of higa mice increased 2.7-fold at 30 wk of age as compared with those at 10 wk of age, whereas normal mice did not show such increase. the surface iga+b220− lp lymphocytes spontaneously secreted iga in culture. morphological studies showed that the surface iga+b220− lymphocytes of murine intestinal lp are identical with plasma cells (pcs). about 20% of iga+b220− pc in lp expressed both mac-1 and cd19, suggesting that they may derive from peritoneal b-1 cells. cell cycle study on intestinal iga-pcs using bromodeoxyuridine revealed no difference between higa mice and normal mice, suggesting that the high frequency of iga-producing pcs in higa mice is not due to enhanced proliferation or prolonged survival of iga-producing pcs in lp. in addition, iga secretion into the gut lumen of higa mice decreased drastically (to one forth) with aging. these data suggest that the increased number of intestinal iga-producing pcs and the down-regulation of iga excretion into the intestinal lumen might synergistically contribute to the hyperserum iga in higa mice and resultant iga deposition to the kidney.
we describe a new deep learning architecture for learning to rank question answer pairs. our approach extends the long short-term memory (lstm) network with holographic composition to model the relationship between question and answer representations. as opposed to the neural tensor layer that has been adopted recently, the holographic composition provides the benefits of scalable and rich representational learning approach without incurring huge parameter costs. overall, we present holographic dual lstm (hd-lstm), a unified architecture for both deep sentence modeling and semantic matching. essentially, our model is trained end-to-end whereby the parameters of the lstm are optimized in a way that best explains the correlation between question and answer representations. in addition, our proposed deep learning architecture requires no extensive feature engineering. via extensive experiments, we show that hd-lstm outperforms many other neural architectures on two popular benchmark qa datasets. empirical studies confirm the effectiveness of holographic composition over the neural tensor layer. matching natural language sentences is central for many applications such as information retrieval and question answering. existing deep models rely on a single sentence representation or multiple granularity representations for matching. however, such methods cannot well capture the contextualized local information in the matching process. to tackle this problem, we present a new deep architecture to match two sentences with multiple positional sentence representations. specifically, each positional sentence representation is a sentence representation at this position, generated by a bidirectional long short term memory (bi-lstm). the matching score is finally produced by aggregating interactions between these different positional sentence representations, through $k$-max pooling and a multi-layer perceptron. our model has several advantages: (1) by using bi-lstm, rich context of the whole sentence is leveraged to capture the contextualized local information in each positional sentence representation; (2) by matching with multiple positional sentence representations, it is flexible to aggregate different important contextualized local information in a sentence to support the matching; (3) experiments on different tasks such as question answering and sentence completion demonstrate the superiority of our model.
links between parents’ psychiatric symptoms and their children’s behavioral and emotional problems have been widely documented in previous research, and the search for moderators of this association has begun. however, family structure (single versus dual-parent households) has received little attention as a potential moderator, despite indirect evidence that risk may be elevated in single-parent homes. two other candidate moderators—youth gender and age—have been tested directly, but with inconsistent findings across studies, perhaps in part because studies have differed in whether they used youth clinical samples and in which informants (parents vs. youths) reported on youth problems. in the present study, we examined these three candidate moderators using a sample of exclusively clinic-referred youths (n = 333, 34 % girls, aged 7–14,) and assessing youth problems through both parent- and youth-reports. both family structure and youth gender emerged as robust moderators across parent and youth informants. parent symptoms were associated with youth internalizing and externalizing problems in single-parent but not dual-parent homes; and parent symptoms were associated with youth internalizing problems among boys, but not girls. the moderator findings suggest that the risks associated with parent psychopathology may not be uniform but may depend, in part, on family structure and youth gender. context decades of randomized controlled trials have produced separate evidence-based treatments for depression, anxiety, and conduct problems in youth, but these treatments are not often used in clinical practice, and they produce mixed results in trials with the comorbid, complex youths seen in practice. an integrative, modular redesign may help.   objective standard/separate and modular/integrated arrangements of evidence-based treatments for depression, anxiety, and conduct problems in youth were compared with usual care treatment, with the modular design permitting a multidisorder focus and a flexible application of treatment procedures.   design randomized effectiveness trial.   setting ten outpatient clinical service organizations in massachusetts and hawaii.   participants a total of 84 community clinicians were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions for the treatment of 174 clinically referred youths who were 7 to 13 years of age (70% of these youths were boys, and 45% were white). the study was conducted during the period from january 12, 2005 to may 8, 2009.   interventions standard manual treatment (59 youths [34% of the sample]; cognitive behavioral therapy for depression, cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety, and behavioral parent training for conduct problems), modular treatment (62 youths [36%]; integrating the procedures of the 3 separate treatments), and usual care (53 youths [30%]).   main outcome measures outcomes were assessed using weekly youth and parent assessments. these assessments relied on a standardized brief problem checklist and a patient-generated top problems assessment (ie, the severity ratings on the problems that the youths and parents had identified as most important). we also conducted a standardized diagnostic assessment before and after treatment.   results mixed effects regression analyses showed that modular treatment produced significantly steeper trajectories of improvement than usual care and standard treatment on multiple brief problem checklist and top problems assessment measures. youths receiving modular treatment also had significantly fewer diagnoses than youths receiving usual care after treatment. in contrast, outcomes of standard manual treatment did not differ significantly from outcomes of usual care.   conclusions the modular approach outperformed usual care and standard evidence-based treatments on multiple clinical outcome measures. the modular approach may be a promising way to build on the strengths of evidence-based treatments, improving their utility and effectiveness with referred youths in clinical practice settings. trial registration  clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct01178554.
using fiducial markers ensures reliable detection and identification of planar features in images. fiducials are used in a wide range of applications, especially when a reliable visual reference is needed, e.g., to track the camera in cluttered or textureless environments. a marker designed for such applications must be robust to partial occlusions, varying distances and angles of view, and fast camera motions. in this paper, we present a robust, highly accurate fiducial system, whose markers consist of concentric rings, along with its theoretical foundations. relying on projective properties, it allows to robustly localize the imaged marker and to accurately detect the position of the image of the (common) circle center. we demonstrate that our system can detect and accurately localize these circular fiducials under very challenging conditions and the experimental results reveal that it outperforms other recent fiducial systems. over the last decades fiducial markers have provided widely adopted tools to add reliable model-based features into an otherwise general scene. given their central role in many computer vision tasks, countless different solutions have been proposed in the literature. some designs are focused on the accuracy of the recovered camera pose with respect to the tag; some other concentrate on reaching high detection speed or on recognizing a large number of distinct markers in the scene. in such a crowded area both the researcher and the practitioner are licensed to wonder if there is any need to introduce yet another approach. nevertheless, with this paper, we would like to present a general purpose fiducial marker system that can be deemed to add some valuable features to the pack. specifically, by exploiting the projective properties of a circular set of sizeable dots, we propose a detection algorithm that is highly accurate. further, applying a dot pattern scheme derived from error-correcting codes, allows for robustness with respect to very large occlusions. in addition, the design of the marker itself is flexible enough to accommodate different requirements in terms of pose accuracy and number of patterns. the overall performance of the marker system is evaluated in an extensive experimental section, where a comparison with a well-known baseline technique is presented.
s: nagy, zs., tqkes, sz., aradi, j. studying the effect of antisense oligonucleotides targeted against bcr-abl, bcl-2, c-myb and (da)10 on the proliferation of k562 to gain further insight into the role of raf-1 in normal cell growth, c-raf-1 mrna expression, raf-1 protein production, and raf-1-associated kinase activity in normal human t cells were analyzed. in contrast to the constitutive expression of raf-1 in continuously proliferating cell lines, c-raf-1 mrna and raf-1 protein levels were barely detectable in freshly isolated g0 t lymphocytes. previous work with fibroblasts has suggested that raf-1 plays a signaling role in the g0-g1 phase transition. in t cells, triggering via the t-cell antigen receptor (tcr)-cd3 complex (tcr/cd3) resulted in an approximately fourfold increase in c-raf-1 mrna. in addition, the promotion of g1 progression by interleukin 2 (il-2) was associated with a 5- to 10-fold immediate/early induction of c-raf-1 mrna, resulting in up to a 12-fold increase in raf-1 protein expression. tcr/cd3 activation did not alter the phosphorylation state of raf-1, whereas interleukin 2 receptor stimulation resulted in a rapid increase in the phosphorylation state of a subpopulation of raf-1 molecules progressively increasing throughout g1. these findings were complemented by assays for raf-1-associated kinase activity which revealed a gradual accumulation of serine and threonine autokinase activity in raf-1 immunoprecipitates during g1, which remained elevated throughout dna replication.
ceratomyxa shasta is a myxozoan parasite identified as a contributor to salmon mortality in the klamath river, usa. the parasite has a complex life cycle involving a freshwater polychaete, manayunkia speciosa and a salmonid. as part of ongoing research on how environmental parameters influence parasite establishment and replication, we designed a laboratory experiment to examine the effect of water flow (velocity) on completion of the c. shasta infectious cycle. the experiment tested the effect of two water velocities, 0.05 and 0.01 m s(-1), on survival and infection of m. speciosa as well as transmission to susceptible rainbow trout and comparatively resistant klamath river chinook salmon. the faster water velocity facilitated the greatest polychaete densities, but the lowest polychaete infection prevalence. rainbow trout became infected in all treatments, but at the slower velocity had a shorter mean day to death, indicating a higher infectious dose. infection was not detected in chinook salmon even at a dose estimated to be as high as 80,000 actinospores per fish. the higher water velocity resulted in lower c. shasta infection prevalence in m. speciosa and decreased infection severity in fish. another outcome of our experiment is the description of a system for maintaining and infecting m. speciosa in the laboratory. myxobolus cerebralis, the myxozoan parasite responsible for whirling disease in salmonid fishes, has a complex life-cycle involving an invertebrate host and 2 spore stages. water flow rate is an environmental variable thought to affect the establishment and propagation of m. cerebralis; however, experimental data that separates flow effects from those of other variables are scarce. to compare how this parameter affected parasite infection dynamics and the invertebrate and vertebrate hosts, dead, infected fish were introduced into a naive habitat with susceptible hosts under 2 experimental flow regimes: slow (0 x 02 cm/s) and fast (2 x 0 cm/s). throughout the 1-year study, uninfected fry were held in both systems, the outflows were screened weekly for spores and the annelid populations were monitored. we found clear differences in prevalence of infection in the worms, prevalence and severity of infection in the fish, and host survival. both flows provided environments in which m. cerebralis could complete its life-cycle; however, both the parasite and its invertebrate host proliferated to a greater extent in the slow flow environment over the 1-year study period. this finding is of significance for aquatic systems where the flow rate can be manipulated, and should be incorporated into risk analysis assessments.
the mechanisms by which aging progressively depletes testosterone (te) availability in the male are unknown. accordingly, the objective was to estimate brain gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gnrh) outflow (release and action), which cannot be observed directly, on the basis of downstream effects on pituitary luteinizing hormone (lh) secretion. lh, in turn, feeds forward on (stimulates) gonadal te secretion, which then feeds back on (inhibits) gnrh-driven lh secretion. lh and te concentrations were measured repetitively (every 10 min) over 18 h during graded pharmacological blockade of endogenous gnrh outflow in 24 healthy 20- to 72-yr-old men. data were analyzed using a new age-dependent regression model of gnrh-lh-te interactions to estimate pulsatile lh secretion and elimination, gnrh outflow, lh feedforward, and te feedback. by incorporating regression on age within the dose-response model, we show that aging erodes all three primary forward and reverse pathways linking the brain, pituitary gland, and testes. aging is associated with concomitant deficits in gnrh --> lh feedforward, lh --> te feedforward, and te --> gnrh/lh feedback. the analytical formalism should be generalizable to other ensemble regulatory systems, such as those that control growth, reproduction, stress adaptations, and glucose metabolism. pulsatile and thus total testosterone (te) secretion declines in older men, albeit for unknown reasons. analytical models forecast that aging may reduce the capability of endogenous luteinizing hormone (lh) pulses to stimulate leydig cell steroidogenesis. this notion has been difficult to test experimentally. the present study used graded doses of a selective gonadotropin releasing hormone (gnrh)-receptor antagonist to yield four distinct strata of pulsatile lh release in each of 18 healthy men ages 23-72 yr. deconvolution analysis was applied to frequently sampled lh and te concentration time series to quantitate pulsatile te secretion over a 16-h interval. log-linear regression was used to relate pulsatile lh secretion to attendant pulsatile te secretion (lh-te drive) across the four stepwise interventions in each subject. linear regression of the 18 individual estimates of lh-te feedforward dose-response slopes on age disclosed a strongly negative relationship (r = -0.721, p < 0.001). accordingly, the present data support the thesis that aging in healthy men attenuates amplitude-dependent lh drive of burst-like te secretion. the experimental strategy of graded suppression of neuroglandular outflow may have utility in estimating dose-response adaptations in other endocrine systems.
two-dimensional gel electrophoretic analysis of the proteome of streptococcus mutans grown at a steady state in a glucose-limited anaerobic continuous culture revealed a number of proteins that were differentially expressed when the growth ph was lowered from ph 7.0 to ph 5.0. changes in the expression of metabolic proteins were generally limited to three biochemical pathways: glycolysis, alternative acid production and branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis. the relative level of expression of protein spots representing all of the enzymes associated with the embden-meyerhof-parnas pathway, and all but one of the enzymes involved in the major alternative acid fermentation pathways of s. mutans, was identified and measured. proteome data, in conjunction with end-product and cell-yield analyses, were consistent with a phenotypic change that allowed s. mutans to proliferate at low ph by expending energy to extrude excess h(+) from the cell, while minimizing the detrimental effects that result from the uncoupling of carbon flux from catabolism and the consequent imbalance in nadh and pyruvate production. the changes in enzyme levels were consistent with a reduction in the formation of the strongest acid, formic acid, which was a consequence of the diversion of pyruvate to both lactate and branched-chain amino acid production when s. mutans was cultivated in an acidic environment. a plaque growth chamber was developed for long-term growth of five separate plaques from the same plaque or saliva sample under identical conditions of temperature and gas phase. reagent addition and growth conditions for each plaque could be independently controlled, and each was accessible for sequential sampling and electrode insertion. plaques were cultured for over six weeks on pellicle-coated lux (tm) 25-mm diameter cover-slips at 35°c under 5% co2 in n 2, and supplied with a medium containing 0.25% mucin (bmm) at 3.6 ml/h, and with periodic 5% sucrose. electron microscopy and flora analysis of microcosm plaques showed that they had close similarities to reported characteristics of natural dental plaques. diverse motile bacteria were present. sucrose-induced stephan ph curves and urea-induced ph rises were also similar to those reported for natural plaques. changes in plaque urease, calcium, phosphate concentrations, and the flora were followed over five weeks in a plaque supplied with bmm containing additional 2.5 mmol/l calcium and 7.5 mmol/l phosphate. despite this high environmental calcium phosphate concentration, there was no continuing increase in calcium levels, although plaque phosphate doubled. urease levels fluctuated. changes in the cultivable flora were minor. a urea-containing calcium phosphate/ mono-fluorophosphate ph 5 solution, applied for six min every two h for seven days, increased plaque calcium, phosphate, and fluoride to high levels. thus, plaques grown over several weeks in the multi-station artificial mouth exhibited metabolic and ph behavior typical of natural plaques, could be analyzed during development, and the system allowed manipulation of environmental variables important in plaque ph control and calcification.
genetic and epigenetic mechanisms may interact and together affect biological processes and disease development. however, most previous studies have investigated genetic and epigenetic mechanisms independently, and studies examining their interactions throughout the human genome are lacking. to identify genetic loci that interact with the epigenome, we performed the first genome-wide dna methylation quantitative trait locus (mqtl) analysis in human pancreatic islets. we related 574,553 single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) with genome-wide dna methylation data of 468,787 cpg sites targeting 99% of refseq genes in islets from 89 donors. we identified 67,438 snp-cpg pairs in cis, corresponding to 36,783 snps (6.4% of tested snps) and 11,735 cpg sites (2.5% of tested cpgs), and 2,562 significant snp-cpg pairs in trans, corresponding to 1,465 snps (0.3% of tested snps) and 383 cpg sites (0.08% of tested cpgs), showing significant associations after correction for multiple testing. these include reported diabetes loci, e.g. adcy5, kcnj11, hla-dqa1, ins, pdx1 and grb10. cpgs of significant cis-mqtls were overrepresented in the gene body and outside of cpg islands. follow-up analyses further identified mqtls associated with gene expression and insulin secretion in human islets. causal inference test (cit) identified snp-cpg pairs where dna methylation in human islets is the potential mediator of the genetic association with gene expression or insulin secretion. functional analyses further demonstrated that identified candidate genes (gpx7, gstt1 and snx19) directly affect key biological processes such as proliferation and apoptosis in pancreatic β-cells. finally, we found direct correlations between dna methylation of 22,773 (4.9%) cpgs with mrna expression of 4,876 genes, where 90% of the correlations were negative when cpgs were located in the region surrounding transcription start site. our study demonstrates for the first time how genome-wide genetic and epigenetic variation interacts to influence gene expression, islet function and potential diabetes risk in humans. type 1 diabetes (t1d) is a common autoimmune disorder that arises from the action of multiple genetic and environmental risk factors. we report the findings of a genome-wide association study of t1d, combined in a meta-analysis with two previously published studies. the total sample set included 7,514 cases and 9,045 reference samples. forty-one distinct genomic locations provided evidence for association with t1d in the meta-analysis (p < 10−6). after excluding previously reported associations, we further tested 27 regions in an independent set of 4,267 cases, 4,463 controls and 2,319 affected sib-pair (asp) families. of these, 18 regions were replicated (p < 0.01; overall p < 5 × 10−8) and 4 additional regions provided nominal evidence of replication (p < 0.05). the many new candidate genes suggested by these results include il10, il19, il20, glis3, cd69 and il27.
aim this article presents findings from a participatory action research study into the experience and use of occupation, theory and evidence in the everyday practice of a group of occupational therapists working in a large metropolitan hospital delivering a range of acute services, in melbourne, australia.   methods and findings narrative data gathered from 11 individual interviews and 10 group discussions were analysed through numerous iterative cycles to explore research issues and evaluate research actions. this article discusses why the participating occupational therapists chose to change the language they used to describe their practice from a focus on 'function' to a focus on 'occupation'. this change improved the therapists' levels of confidence, strengthened their professional identities and provided for a sense of renewed empowerment within the organisation.   conclusions the findings suggest that occupational therapists in acute settings can utilise language more effectively to augment their ability to promote the vital and unique contribution that occupational therapy has to make. such small, yet powerful changes can empower occupational therapists to address long-standing dilemmas of representation and enable transformative practices. the disclosure relates to can end seamers and similar apparatus, in which end closures are secured on top of successive containers by securing tools, these tools and the support means which carry the containers being rotated simultaneously by a drive common to all the working parts of the machine and derived from a level above the securing tools. a single, unpressurized, gravity/centrifugal, entirely internal lubricating system is described.
geo-demographic analysis is an essential part of a geographical information system (gis) for predicting people’s behavior based on statistical models and their residential location. fuzzy geographically weighted clustering (fgwc) serves as one of the most efficient algorithms in geo-demographic analysis. despite being an effective algorithm, fgwc is sensitive to initialize when the random selection of cluster centers makes the iterative process falling into the local optimal solution easily. artificial bee colony (abc), one of the most popular meta-heuristic algorithms, can be regarded as the tool to achieve global optimization solutions. this research aims to propose a novel geo-demographic analysis algorithm that integrates fgwc to the optimization scheme of abc for improving geo-demographic clustering accuracy. experimental results on various datasets show that the clustering quality of the proposed algorithm called fgwc-abc is better than those of other relevant methods. the proposed algorithm is also applied to a decision-making application for analyzing crime behavior problem in the population using the us communities and crime dataset. it provides fuzzy rules to determine the violent crime rate in terms of linguistic labels from socioeconomic variables. these results are significant to make predictions of further us violent crime rate and to facilitate appropriate decisions on prevention such the situations in the future. geographic information systems (gis) play a very important role to researches and industries. in fact, there have been some studies related to the development of this kind of systems as well as methods of mining attribute gis data. in this paper, we will explore an aspect of data mining in gis, that is, gis clustering for geo-demographic analysis and present a novel context-based fuzzy geographically weighted clustering algorithm to solve such task.
backgroundpatients undergoing intermediate-risk surgery are typically taken to the ward postoperatively. however, some may develop complications requiring intensive care later. we aimed to evaluate the characteristics of patients undergoing intermediate-risk surgery who required late postoperative admission to the intensive care unit (icu) and determine the predictors for this.methodsthe study included patients undergoing intermediate-risk surgery with preoperative indication for icu but who were taken to the ward postoperatively, because they appeared to be responding well. however, they required late icu admission. icu care and preoperative saps 3 score were evaluated. palliative surgeries and patients readmitted to icu were excluded.resultsthe study included 100 patients, 27 % of whom had late postoperative admission to the icu. the preoperative saps 3 score was higher (45.4 ± 7.8 vs. 35.9 ± 7.4, p < 0.001) in patients who required delayed admission to the icu postoperatively. furthermore, they had undergone longer surgery (4.2 ± 1.9 vs. 2.7 ± 1.5 h, p < 0.001), and a greater proportion were gastrointestinal surgeries (14.8 vs. 5.5 %, p = 0.03) and intraoperative transfusion (18.5 vs. 5.5 % p = 0.04). in multivariate analysis, preoperative saps 3 and surgery duration independently predicted postoperative icu admission, respectively (or 1.25; 95 % ci 1.1–1.4 and or 3.33; 95 % ci 1.7–6.3).conclusionthe identification of high-risk surgical patients is essential for proper treatment; time of surgery and preoperative saps 3 seem to provide a useful indication of risk and may help better to characterize patients undergoing intermediate-risk surgery that demand icu care. objectiverisk adjustment systems now in use were developed more than a decade ago and lack prognostic performance. objective of the saps 3 study was to collect data about risk factors and outcomes in a heterogeneous cohort of intensive care unit (icu) patients, in order to develop a new, improved model for risk adjustment.designprospective multicentre, multinational cohort study.patients and settinga total of 19,577 patients consecutively admitted to 307 icus from 14 october to 15 december 2002.measurements and resultsdata were collected at icu admission, on days 1, 2 and 3, and the last day of the icu stay. data included sociodemographics, chronic conditions, diagnostic information, physiological derangement at icu admission, number and severity of organ dysfunctions, length of icu and hospital stay, and vital status at icu and hospital discharge. data reliability was tested with use of kappa statistics and intraclass-correlation coefficients, which were >0.85 for the majority of variables. completeness of the data was also satisfactory, with 1 [0–3] saps ii parameter missing per patient. prognostic performance of the saps ii was poor, with significant differences between observed and expected mortality rates for the overall cohort and four (of seven) defined regions, and poor calibration for most tested subgroups.conclusionsthe saps 3 study was able to provide a high-quality multinational database, reflecting heterogeneity of current icu case-mix and typology. the poor performance of saps ii in this cohort underscores the need for development of a new risk adjustment system for critically ill patients.
linguistic knowledge in natural language understanding systems is commonly stratified across several levels. this is true of information extraction as well. typical state-of-the-art information extraction systems require syntactic-semantic patterns for locating facts or events in text; domain-specific word or concept classes for semantic generalization; and a specialized lexicon of terms that may not be found in general-purpose dictionaries, among other kinds of knowledge. we describe an approach to unsupervised, or minimally supervised, knowledge acquisition. the approach is based on bootstrapping a comprehensive knowledge base from a small set of seed elements. our approach is embodied in algorithms for discovery of patterns, concept classes, and lexicon, from raw un-annotated text. we present the results of knowledge acquisition, and examine them in the context of prior work. we discuss problems in evaluating the quality of the acquired knowledge, and methodologies for evaluation. 1 customization for information extraction this chapter focuses on event-level information extraction (ie), and its lowerlevel enabling components. the objective of ie, as considered here, is to analyze text written in plain natural language, and to find facts or events in the text. the facts and events are formally expressed as multi-argument (n-ary) relations, whose arguments are entities, corresponding to objects in the real world. information extraction systems typically operate within a specific domain, and need to be adapted for every new domain of interest. adaptation for a particular domain entails the collection of knowledge that is needed to operate within that domain. experience indicates that such collection cannot be undertaken by manual means only—i.e., by enlisting domain experts to provide expertise, and computational linguists to induct the expertise into the system,—as the costs would compromise the enterprise. this is known as the acquisition bottleneck. hence, attention has centered on the process of knowledge acquisition for nlp in general, and for ie in particular. there has been an observable trend in these approaches, moving from the labor-intensive manual methods of customization, toward automatic methods of knowledge acquisition; further, among the automatic methods, moving from fully-supervised methods, which require large amounts of annotation, toward unsupervised or minimally supervised methods. m.t. pazienza (ed.): scie 2002, lnai 2700, pp. 1–28, 2003. c © springer-verlag berlin heidelberg 2003 written communication of ideas is carried out on the basis of statistical probability in that a writer chooses that level of subject specificity and that combination of words which he feels will convey the most meaning. since this process varies among individuals and since similar ideas are therefore relayed at different levels of specificity and by means of different words, the problem of literature searching by machines still presents major difficulties. a statistical approach to this problem will be outlined and the various steps of a system based on this approach will be described. steps include the statistical analysis of a collection of documents in a field of interest, the establishment of a set of "notions" and the vocabulary by which they are expressed, the compilation of a thesaurus-type dictionary and index, the automatic encoding of documents by machine with the aid of such a dictionary, the encoding of topological notations (such as branched structures), the recording of the coded information, the establishment of a searching pattern for finding pertinent information, and the programming of appropriate machines to carry out a search.
the new emerging theory of compressive sampling demonstrates that by exploiting the structure of a signal, it is possible to sample a signal below the nyquist rate—using random projections—and achieve perfect reconstruction. in this paper, we consider a special case of compressive sampling where the uncompressed signal is non-negative, and propose a number of sparse recovery algorithms—which utilise non-negative matrix factorisation (nmf), iteratively reweighted least squares (irls) & nonnegative quadratic programming (nqp)—for the recovery of minimum `p-norm solutions, 0 ≤ p ≤ 1. we examine the performance of nmf when applied to compressed data and discuss consequences for machine learning algorithms applied to random projections of the data to be analysed. as a necessary first step, we investigate the signal recovery performance of the proposed algorithms, and demonstrate that— for sufficiently sparse non-negative signals—the signals recovered by the sparse recovery algorithms and their least squares versions are essentially the same, which suggests that a non-negativity constraint is enough to recover sufficiently sparse signals. we build on our results and extend non-negative matrix factorisation to compressively sampled data, where a sparse non-negative basis and corresponding non-negative coefficients for the original uncompressed matrix are learned indirectly in the compressed domain. thus, demonstrating that machine learning algorithms that employ non-negative constraints can successfully learn uncompressed features from compressed data—by way of a simple modification of the generative model. the new emerging theory of compressive sampling has demonstrated that by exploiting the structure of a signal, it is possible to sample a signal below the nyquist rate and achieve perfect reconstruction. in this short note, we employ non-negative matrix factorisation in the context of compressive sampling and propose two nmf algorithms for signal recovery—one of which utilises iteratively reweighted least squares. the algorithms are applied to compressively sampled non-negative data, where a sparse non-negative basis and corresponding non-negative coefficients for the original uncompressed data are discovered directly in the compressively sampled domain.
bariatric surgery was born in the 1950s at the university of minnesota. from this time, it continues to evolve and, by the same token, gives new or better possibilities to treat not only obesity but also associated comorbidities. metabolomics is also a relatively young science discipline, and similarly, it shows great potential for the comprehensive study of the dynamic alterations of the metabolome. it has been widely used in medicine, biology studies, biomarker discovery, and prognostic evaluations. currently, several dozen metabolomics studies were performed to study the effects of bariatric surgery. lc-ms and nmr are the most frequently used techniques to study main effects of rygb or sg. research has yield many interesting results involving not only clinical parameters but also molecular modulations. detected changes pertain to amino acid, lipids, carbohydrates, or gut microbiota alterations. it proves that including bariatric surgery to metabolic surgery is warranted. however, many molecular modulations after those procedures remain unexplained. therefore, application of metabolomics to study this field seems to be a proper solution. new findings can suggest new directions of surgery technics modifications, contribute to broadening knowledge about obesity and diseases related to it, and perhaps develop nonsurgical methods of treatment in the future. chronological age is one of the most important risk factors for adverse clinical outcome. still, two individuals at the same chronological age could have different biological aging states, leading to different individual risk profiles. capturing this individual variance could constitute an even more powerful predictor enhancing prediction in age-related morbidity. applying a nonlinear regression technique, we constructed a metabonomic measurement for biological age, the metabolic age score, based on urine data measured via (1)h nmr spectroscopy. we validated the score in two large independent population-based samples by revealing its significant associations with chronological age and age-related clinical phenotypes as well as its independent predictive value for survival over approximately 13 years of follow-up. furthermore, the metabolic age score was prognostic for weight loss in a sample of individuals who underwent bariatric surgery. we conclude that the metabolic age score is an informative measurement of biological age with possible applications in personalized medicine.
conventional tabletop systems have focused on communication with virtual data, using phiconsor physical objects as handles. this approach is versatile, given the full use of a horizontal display. however, we consider that an another approach can be formulated that can support normal specific tasks on a table. we have developed a card-handling activity environment enhanced by a tabletop interface. we use a glass tabletop with controllable transparency to improve surface scanning and the display of supplemental data. we describe the architecture of the tabletop system and its design criteria. due to its simple configuration, this tabletop system can handle a large number of paper cards, as used in the kj method. therefore, our system can be used to enhance card-based tasks by showing additional data, and it provides the ability to review transactions by recording the tasks. in this paper we present artoolkitplus, a successor to the popular artoolkit pose tracking library. artoolkitplus has been optimized and extended for the usage on mobile devices such as smartphones, pdas and ultra mobile pcs (umpcs). we explain the need and specific requirements of pose tracking on mobile devices and how we met those requirements. to prove the applicability we performed an extensive benchmark series on a broad range of off-the-shelf handhelds.
abstract in this study, the complete mitogenome sequence of two moray eels of gymnothorax formosus and scuticaria tigrina (anguilliformes: muraenidae) has been sequenced by the next-generation sequencing method. the assembled mitogenome, with the length of 16,558 bp for g. formosus and 16,521 bp for s. tigrina, shows 78% identity to each other. both mitogenomes follow the typical vertebrate arrangement, including 13 protein coding genes, 22 transfer rnas, two ribosomal rnas genes, and a non-coding control region of d-loop. the length of d-loop is 927 bp (g. formosus) and 850 bp (s. tigrina), which is located between trna-pro and trna-phe. the overall gc content is 45.5% for g. formosus and 47.9% for s. tigrina. complete mitogenomes of g. formosus and s. tigrina provide essential and important dna molecular data for further phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis for moray eel. the dual organellar genome annotator (dogma) automates the annotation of organellar (plant chloroplast and animal mitochondrial) genomes. it is a web-based package that allows the use of blast searches against a custom database, and conservation of basepairing in the secondary structure of animal mitochondrial trnas to identify and annotate genes. dogma provides a graphical user interface for viewing and editing annotations. annotations are stored on our password-protected server to enable repeated sessions of working on the same genome. finished annotations can be extracted for direct submission to genbank.
this paper uses best-worst scaling, a choice-based survey method, to assess adolescents' level of concern for various adverse consequences of tobacco use. in addition to health risks cited most often (i.e., lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases), the study also focuses on less frequently mentioned health implications (e.g., effects on teeth, appearance, skin, weight and sexual dysfunction) and other adverse effects that are unrelated to health, such as cost, addiction, or manipulation by the tobacco industry. the relative importance of 15 items was assessed in a sample of 376 adolescents (ages 14-19 years) in western switzerland. the resulting data provide rich information on the relative importance of the items considered and even allow for the assessment of individual-level preference scales. the results indicate that apart from lung cancer that is consistently rated as being of most concern, less-mentioned health risks such as reduced physical capacity and sexual dysfunction are of significant importance. subgroup analyses and results from a random parameter approach highlight substantial heterogeneity in preferences that should be exploited in future prevention messages. background: one of the greatest difficulties in evaluating healthcare system reform in any country is that governments often do not clearly articulate what it is they are attempting to do. in australia, a recent inquiry set out 15 principles to guide the reform process, but it remains unclear how the australian public values the principles, how such values vary across the country, and, more fundamentally, if australians understand the principles.objectives: to evaluate the australian healthcare reform principles from the perspective of the australian public, to test if such preferences are valued consistently across geographic and socioeconomic strata, and to test for the degree of understanding of the principles among the public.methods: we employed best-worst scaling (bws), a stated-preference method grounded in random utility theory, to elicit public preference for 15 healthcare reform principles. the bws tasks were incorporated into an online survey that also gathered geographic and socioeconomic information and included questions relating to the understanding of the reform principles. respondents were a geographically diverse set of australians who were randomized to receive one of two versions of the survey, each containing a block of 15 choice tasks. tasks in block one contained a subset of the choice tasks containing subsets of seven principles based on a balanced incomplete block design, while tasks in block two contained tasks with eight principles defined by the complement of the former.in each bws task, respondents were simply asked to identify the most and least important principle. analysis of preference was based on assigning the most valued principles a ‘1’ and the least valued principles ‘−1’, and with each item appearing eight times in each block, preferences were analyzed over a cardinal utility scale bounded by −8 and +8. analysis was based on simple summary statistics and stratified by geographic and socioeconomic measures.results: a sample of 204 respondents participated in the survey (a participation rate of 85%). quality and safety was the most important principle and a culture of reflective improvement and innovation was the least important. public voice and community engagement was the second least important principle and was also understood by barely half the respondents.conclusions: this research demonstrates how random-utility-based methods can be used to provide estimates of the importance of reform principles that have known statistical properties. the bws task used forced respondents to discriminate between the principles on offer, unlike rating scales. researchers and practitioners in healthcare should consider using bws tasks in preference to rating scales.
planning for and managing radiological terrorism incidents that involve the release of radionuclides from a dirty bomb requires considering the potential lifesaving impact of protective radionuclide decorporation countermeasures (e.g., lung lavage). lung lavage therapy could prevent deaths via the pulmonary mode (which involves radiation pneumonitis and fibrosis) by reducing the radiation dose to the lung from inhaled radionuclides. the risk avoidance (rav) assessment framework introduced in a related paper is used to evaluate the pulmonary-lethality-mode rav due to lung lavage and the associated risk avoidance proportion (rap) for hypothetical inhalation-exposure scenarios. the lethality rav is a measure (on a scale from 0 to 1) of the actual risk reduction associated with the applied protective countermeasures. the lethality rap is the lethality rav divided by the lethality risk when no protective countermeasures are employed and is a useful measure of the efficacy of the countermeasures applied. examples of pulmonary-mode lethality rav and rap calculations are presented for hypothetical scenarios involving lung lavage to remove beta and/or gamma-emitting radionuclides that are inhaled in highly insoluble forms. the approach presented could be used to develop optimal schemes for applying lung lavage therapy following a terrorist incident involving a dirty bomb. this paper provides theoretical health-risk-assessment tools that are designed to facilitate planning for and managing radiological terrorism incidents that involve ingestion exposure to bone-seeking radionuclides (e.g., radiostrontium nuclides). the focus is on evaluating lethality risk avoidance (rav; i.e., the decrease in risk) that is associated with radionuclide decorporation countermeasures employed to remove ingested bone-seeking beta and/or gamma-emitting radionuclides from the body. to illustrate the application of tools presented, hypothetical radiostrontium decorporation scenarios were considered that involved evaluating the hematopoietic-mode-lethality rav. for evaluating the efficacy of specific decorporation countermeasures, the lethality risk avoidance proportion (rap; which is the rav divided by the total lethality risk in the absence of protective countermeasures) is introduced. the lethality rap is expected to be a useful tool for designing optimal radionuclide decorporation schemes and for identifying green, yellow and red dose-rate zones. for the green zone, essentially all of the lethality risk is expected to be avoided (rap = 1) as a consequence of the radionuclide decorporation scheme used. for the yellow zone, some but not all of the lethality risk is expected to be avoided. for the red zone, none of the lethality risk (which equals 1) is expected to be avoided.
current web server farms have simple resource allocation models. one model used is to dedicate a server or a group of servers for each customer. another model partitions physical servers into logical servers and assigns one to each customer. yet another model allows customers to be active on multiple servers using load-balancing techniques. the ability to handle peak loads while minimizing cost of resources required on the farm is a subject of ongoing research.we improve resource utilization through sharing. customer load is expressed as a multidimensional probability distribution. each customer is assigned to a server so as to minimize the total number of servers needed to host all the customers. we use the notion of complementarity of customers in simple heuristics for this stochastic vector-packing problem. the proposed method generates a resource allocation plan while guaranteeing a qos to each customer. simulation results justify our scheme. statistical sharing over several timescales is a key feature of the internet, and is likely to be an essential aspect of future atm networks. in this chapter we describe how usage-sensitive pricing can encourage statistical sharing, and we provide a quantitative framework for the discussion of pricing issues in systems where statistical sharing is important. in particular we describe a simple charging and accounting mechanism for real-time bursty connections, based on the concept of an eeective bandwidth. the mechanism performs the dual role of conveying information to the network that allows more eecient statistical sharing, and information to the user about the resource implications of diierently policed connection requests. the resulting tarii takes a strikingly simple form: a charge a(x) per unit time, a charge b(x) per unit volume of traac carried, and a charge c(x) per connection, where the triple (a(x); b(x); c(x)) are xed at the time of connection acceptance as a function of the connection contract x. this form of tarii is also able to reveal user preferences concerning delay tolerant traac, and thus promises to provide a uniied pricing model over a wide range of quality of service classes.
pseudolaric acid b (pab) possesses comparable fungicidal activity against candida albicans to amphotericin b and antifungal activity against azole-resistant candida species. however, its poor water solubility makes the formulation a considerable challenge for dermal permeation of pab. the aim of this project was to improve the solubility and eventually the dermal permeability and bioavailability by developing a microemulsion based gel for pab (pab me-gel). pab me-gel was formulated using isopropyl myristate as oil phase, cremphor el as surfactant, transcutol p as cosurfactant, and carbopol as gel matrix, and characterized by droplet size, morphology, ph, and rheology. the 3 month storage test showed that pab me-gel possessed good physicochemical stability. in vitro permeation of pab through rat skin from me-gel was investigated in comparison with pab microemulsion (pab me) and pab hydrogel (pab gel), and results showed that me significantly enhanced pab retention in the skin and permeation through the skin whether it was incorporated into the gel or not. in vivo dermatopharmacokinetics study using microdialysis further confirmed that me-gel significantly increased pab dermal bioavailability compared with the gel (41.95 ± 8.89 μg/ml vs. 13.90 ± 2.22 μg/ml). in vitro sensitivity against c. albicans test indicated that the antifungal activity of pab me-gel increased with the increase of pab loading, and 8 mg/g of pab me-gel exhibited a higher antifungal activity than that of 20mg/g miconazole nitrate cream. in vivo antifungal activity evaluation in c. albicans infected guinea pigs showed that 8 mg/g of pab me-gel exhibited a higher efficacy than that of 20mg/g miconazole nitrate cream after 7 day treatment. overall, the results indicated that the me enhanced in vitro permeability, in vivo dermal bioavailability, and antifungal activity of pab. therefore, me-gel may be a promising approach for topical dermal delivery of pab to treat skin fungal infection. the objective was to develop a ternary skin targeting system for ketoconazole (ket) using a combined strategy of microemulsion (me) and cyclodextrin (hp-β-cd), i.e., ket-cd-me, which exploits both virtues of cyclodextrin complex and me to obtain the synergetic effect. ket-cd-me was formulated using labrafil m 1944 cs as oil phase, solutol hs 15 as surfactant, transcutol p as cosurfactant, and hp-β-cd solution as aqueous phase. the formulation of ket-cd-me was optimized and the optimal formulation was characterized in terms of particle size, size distribution, ph value, and viscosity. long term stability experiment showed that hp-β-cd could increase the physical stability of ternary system and ket chemical stability. percutaneous permeation of ket from ket-cd-me in vitro through rat skin was investigated in comparison with ket microemulsion (ket-me), ket hp-β-cd inclusion solution (ket-cd), ket aqueous suspension, and commercial ket cream; the results showed that the combination of me with hp-β-cd exhibited significantly synergistic effect on ket deposition within the skin (29.38 ± 1.79 μg/cm(2)) and a slightly synergistic effect on ket penetration through the skin (11.3 μg/cm(2)/h). the enhancement of the combination on skin deposition was further visualized by confocal laser scanning microscope (clsm). in vitro sensitivity against candida parapsilosis test indicated that ket-cd-me enhanced ket antifungal activity mainly owing to the solubilization of hp-β-cd on ket in the ternary system. moreover, the interactions between hp-β-cd and ket in the ternary system were elucidated through microscale thermophoresis (mst) and 2d (1)h nmr spectroscopy. the profiles from mst confirmed the host-guest interactions of hp-β-cd with ket in the ternary system and a deep insight into the interactions between ket and hp-β-cd were obtained by means of 2d (1)h nmr spectroscopy. the results indicate that the ternary system of me combination with hp-β-cd may be a promising approach for skin targeting delivery of ket.
the gonadal description of the freshwater atherinopsid pike silverside chirostoma estor suggests that the gonads differentiate as ovaries or testes by 8 weeks after hatching when raised at 21 °c. thermal treatments at 14 °c, 21 °c and 29 °c applied from fertilisation, clearly affected phenotypic sex ratios, suggesting that the thermolabile window of sex determination occurred early in development. in this study, exposure to the highest temperature led to male-biased sex ratios in this species. however, the effects of the lower and medium temperatures on the sex ratios were less clear, suggesting the presence of a mixture of genotypic and temperature-dependent sex determination (tsd) mechanisms in c. estor, similar to other atherinopsids. this work further enhances our knowledge regarding the diversity and plasticity of tsd mechanisms in atherinopsid and teleost fish. elevated water temperature has been found to cause gonadal degeneration in fish, including the partial or complete loss of germinal elements, and might impair fertility and reproductive performance. germ cell–deficient and even completely sterile pejerrey odontesthes bonariensis have been found in two lagoons in argentina, and exposure to warm water is one of the possible causes of these abnormalities. this experiment was conducted (a) to compare the histological characteristics of the abnormal gonads from wild pejerrey with those of animals exposed to heat in the laboratory and (b) to examine whether short‐term pulses of heat similar to diurnal temperature variations in natural environments during summer can trigger gonadal cell degeneration in adult pejerrey. wild fish with gonadal abnormalities were obtained from the san miguel del monte and lacombe lagoons (buenos aires province, argentina). laboratory specimens were obtained by exposure of adult pejerrey to five thermal regimes (constant 24° and 29°c and 12‐h cycles of 27°–31°, 28°–30°, and 28°–31°c) for up to 16 wk. germ cell–deficient specimens for histological comparison with wild animals were also obtained by exposing larvae and juveniles for 8–12 wk to 29°c and rearing until they became adults. the histological characteristics of the abnormal gonads of wild pejerrey closely resembled those of fish partially or completely sterilized by high water temperature in the laboratory. the results indicate that fluctuating (high) thermal regimes triggered germ cell disappearance in a manner comparable to a constant temperature of 29°c. these results support the notion that high temperature during unusually warm summers might trigger germ cell degeneration and could be the cause of the observed gonadal abnormalities in wild pejerrey.
purpose to identify candidate protein biomarkers in sera indicative of acute retinal injury. methods we used laser photocoagulation as a model of acute retinal injury in rhesus macaques. in a paired-control study design, we collected serum from each animal (n=6) at 4 h, 1 day, and 3 days following a mock procedure and then again following retinal laser treatment that produced mild lesions. samples were fractionated by isoelectric focusing, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (lc-ms/ms). spectral counting was used to determine relative protein abundances and identify proteins with statistically significant differences between control and treated sera. results mild retinal injury was confirmed by fundus photography and histological examination. the average number of total proteins detected by lc-ms/ms was 908±82 among samples from all three time points. following statistical analysis and employing stringent filtering criteria, a total of 19 proteins were identified as being significantly more abundant in sera following laser-induced retinal injury, relative to control sera. many of the proteins detected were unique to one time point. however, four proteins (phosphoglycerate kinase 1, keratin 18, lewis alpha-3-fucosyltransferase, and ephrin receptor a2) showed differences that were significant at both 4 h and 1 day after laser treatment, followed by a decrease to baseline levels by day 3. conclusions a serum biomarker response to mild retinal laser injury was demonstrated in a primate model. among the proteins detected with highest significant differences, most are upregulated within 24 h, and their appearance in the serum is transient. it is conceivable that a panel of these proteins could provide a means for detecting the acute-phase response to retinal injury. further investigation of these candidate biomarkers and their correlation to retinal damage is warranted. purpose ureteropelvic junction obstruction may either worsen and require surgery, improve or remain stable. it may take upward of 3 years for the natural history to unfold. urinary proteome analysis using capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry has been shown to differentiate between normal infants and those with ureteropelvic junction obstruction. we sought to confirm these findings using liquid chromatography/nano-spray mass spectrometry to examine the urinary proteome in patients with unilateral grade iv ureteropelvic junction obstruction compared to age matched healthy infants.   materials and methods urine specimens were obtained from 21 healthy infants with normal maternal/fetal ultrasound and 25 infants with grade iv unilateral ureteropelvic junction obstruction. specimens were prepared using standard methods and subjected to liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analysis. normalized data were annotated using the ipa(r) knowledge platform.   results there were 31 proteins significantly different in their level of abundance at 1 to 6 months, and 18 at 7 to 12 months compared to age matched controls. these proteins clustered into major functional networks. all of the biomarkers previously reported in clinical studies of ureteropelvic junction obstruction were observed with the notable exception of transforming growth factor-beta1.   conclusions these results confirm the presence of significant differences in the urinary proteome in unilateral ureteropelvic junction obstruction compared to age matched normal individuals. this study adds new information about levels of abundance of specific proteins and peptides in ureteropelvic junction obstruction, which may allow for better classification of disease subgroups and help to establish improved indications for the early selection of surgical candidates based on urinary protein biomarkers.
prostate cancer is the most common fatal cancers in men, and exposure to toxic elements is the most important factor in the aetiology for prostate cancer. selected elements (cd, cr, cu, fe, mn, ni, pb and zn) were analyzed in the blood, scalp hair and nails of prostate cancer patients and counterpart healthy donors by atomic absorption spectrometry. average concentrations of cd, mn, ni and pb were found to be significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the blood, scalp hair and nails of the patients compared with those of the healthy subjects who exhibited significantly higher concentrations of zn. the correlation study revealed significantly diverse relationships of the elements in the blood, scalp hair and nails of the two donor groups. variations in the elemental concentrations were also noted for various types of prostate cancer (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, transitional cell carcinoma and small cell carcinoma), as well as for different stages of the cancer. multivariate apportionment of trace elements in the blood, scalp hair and nails of the patients was also significantly different than that in the healthy donors. the study evidenced considerably divergent variations in the elemental concentrations in prostate cancer patients in comparison with healthy subjects. background gastrointestinal cancer is one of the most common types of cancer which is predominantly associated with the environmental factors. the carcinogenic processes are linked with the imbalances of trace metals in body fluid and tissues.   methods trace metals (cd, cr, cu, fe, ni, pb and zn) are estimated in blood plasma and scalp hair of the cancer patients and controls employing nitric acid-perchloric acid based wet-digestion followed by atomic absorption spectrophotometric method.   results the mean concentrations of cd, cr, cu and ni were found to be significantly higher in the plasma of patients compared with the controls, however, appreciably higher concentrations of fe and zn were observed in the plasma of controls. the average scalp hair concentrations of zn, fe, pb, cu and cd were notably higher in the patients than controls. the correlation study revealed significantly different mutual variations of the trace metals in the plasma and scalp hair of the patients and controls. the apportionment of trace metals in the plasma and scalp hair of the patients and controls was also considerably different.   conclusions the study revealed that the carcinogenic processes are significantly affecting the trace metal burden and mutual variations in the cancerous patients compared with the controls.
family and youth violence are increasingly recognized as key public health issues in developing countries. parenting interventions form an important evidence-based strategy for preventing violence, both against and by children, yet most rigorous trials of parenting interventions have been conducted in high-income countries, with far fewer in low- and middle-income countries (lmics). this systematic review, conducted in line with cochrane handbook guidelines, investigated the effectiveness of parenting interventions for reducing harsh/abusive parenting, increasing positive parenting practices, and improving parent–child relationships in lmics. attitudes and knowledge were examined as secondary outcomes. a range of databases were systematically searched, and randomized trials included. high heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis, but characteristics of included studies were described according to type of delivery mode and outcome. twelve studies with 1580 parents in nine countries reported results favoring intervention on a range of parenting measures. the validity of results for most studies is unclear due to substantial or unclear risks of bias. however, findings from the two largest, highest-quality trials suggest parenting interventions may be feasible and effective in improving parent–child interaction and parental knowledge in relation to child development in lmics, and therefore may be instrumental in addressing prevention of child maltreatment in these settings. given the well-established evidence base for parenting interventions in high-income countries, and increasingly good evidence for their applicability across cultures and countries, there is now an urgent need for more rigorously evaluated and reported studies, focusing on youth outcomes as well as parenting, adapted for contexts of considerable resource constraints. the cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions is the official document that describes in detail the process of preparing and maintaining cochrane systematic reviews on the effects of healthcare interventions.
currently, deep neural networks are deployed on low-power portable devices by first training a full-precision model using powerful hardware, and then deriving a corresponding low-precision model for efficient inference on such systems. however, training models directly with coarsely quantized weights is a key step towards learning on embedded platforms that have limited computing resources, memory capacity, and power consumption. numerous recent publications have studied methods for training quantized networks, but these studies have mostly been empirical. in this work, we investigate training methods for quantized neural networks from a theoretical viewpoint. we first explore accuracy guarantees for training methods under convexity assumptions. we then look at the behavior of these algorithms for non-convex problems, and show that training algorithms that exploit high-precision representations have an important greedy search phase that purely quantized training methods lack, which explains the difficulty of training using low-precision arithmetic. groups at mit and nyu have collected a dataset of millions of tiny colour images from the web. it is, in principle, an excellent dataset for unsupervised training of deep generative models, but previous researchers who have tried this have found it dicult to learn a good set of lters from the images. we show how to train a multi-layer generative model that learns to extract meaningful features which resemble those found in the human visual cortex. using a novel parallelization algorithm to distribute the work among multiple machines connected on a network, we show how training such a model can be done in reasonable time. a second problematic aspect of the tiny images dataset is that there are no reliable class labels which makes it hard to use for object recognition experiments. we created two sets of reliable labels. the cifar-10 set has 6000 examples of each of 10 classes and the cifar-100 set has 600 examples of each of 100 non-overlapping classes. using these labels, we show that object recognition is signicantly improved by pre-training a layer of features on a large set of unlabeled tiny images.
aims/hypothesisa high but normal fasting plasma glucose level in adults is a risk factor for future development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. we investigated whether normal fasting plasma glucose levels (<5.60 mmol/l) are associated with decreases in insulin sensitivity and beta cell function, as well as an adverse cardiovascular profile in obese youth.methodswe performed a cross-sectional analysis in a multiethnic sample of 1,020 obese youth (614 girls and 406 boys; mean age 12.9 years [ci 95% 12.7–13.1], bmi z score 2.34 [ci 95% 2.31–2.38]) with normal fasting plasma glucose. all participants had a standard ogtt, with calculation of indices of insulin sensitivity and beta cell function. for the analysis, prepubertal and pubertal participants were stratified into quartiles of normal fasting plasma glucose.resultswe observed a significant increase in fasting insulin and auc 2 h glucose across quartiles. pronounced changes were observed in insulin sensitivity and secretion, particularly in the pubertal group. moreover, the odds of presenting with impaired glucose tolerance increased by 4.5% with each 0.06 mmol/l increase in fasting plasma glucose. no significant differences in cardiovascular indices were seen across quartiles.conclusions/interpretationthese data suggest that in obese youth, independent of age, bmi z score, sex, family history and ethnicity, insulin sensitivity and secretion decline when moving from low to high normal fasting plasma glucose. the simple measure of fasting plasma glucose could assist clinicians in identifying children for targeted diabetes screening and subsequent lifestyle management. given the extreme increase in prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, and the potential for metabolic syndrome in obese youth, identifying simplified indexes for assessing stimulated insulin sensitivity is critical. the purpose of this study was validation of two surrogate indexes of insulin sensitivity determined from the oral glucose tolerance test (ogtt): the composite whole body insulin sensitivity index (wbisi) and the insulin sensitivity index (isi). an obese population (aged 8-18 yr) of normal and impaired glucose tolerance individuals was studied. one group (n = 38) performed both the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp and ogtt for comparison of insulin sensitivity measurements as well as (1)h-magnetic resonance spectroscopy estimates of intramyocellular lipid content. another larger (n = 368) cohort participated only in an ogtt. both the wbisi and isi represented good estimates (r = 0.78 and 0.74; p < 0.0005) for clamp-derived insulin sensitivity (glucose disposed, m-value), respectively. in the large cohort, the surrogate indexes demonstrated the shift toward poorer function and increased risk profile as a function of insulin resistance. additionally, the wbisi and isi correlated with intramyocellular lipid content (r = -0.74 and -0.71; p < 0.0001), a tissue marker for insulin resistance. insulin sensitivity can be estimated using plasma glucose and insulin responses derived from the ogtt in obese youth with normal and impaired glucose tolerance.

backgroundeffective teaching requires an understanding of both what (content knowledge) and how (process knowledge) to teach. while previous studies involving medical students have compared preceptors with greater or lesser content knowledge, it is unclear whether process expertise can compensate for deficient content expertise. therefore, the objective of our study was to compare the effect of preceptors with process expertise to those with content expertise on medical students' learning outcomes in a structured small group environment.methodsone hundred and fifty-one first year medical students were randomized to 11 groups for the small group component of the cardiovascular-respiratory course at the university of calgary. each group was then block randomized to one of three streams for the entire course: tutoring exclusively by physicians with content expertise (n = 5), tutoring exclusively by physicians with process expertise (n = 3), and tutoring by content experts for 11 sessions and process experts for 10 sessions (n = 3). after each of the 21 small group sessions, students evaluated their preceptors' teaching with a standardized instrument. students' knowledge acquisition was assessed by an end-of-course multiple choice (eoc-mcq) examination.resultsstudents rated the process experts significantly higher on each of the instrument's 15 items, including the overall rating. students' mean score (±sd) on the eoc-mcq exam was 76.1% (8.1) for groups taught by content experts, 78.2% (7.8) for the combination group and 79.5% (9.2) for process expert groups (p = 0.11). by linear regression student performance was higher if they had been taught by process experts (regression coefficient 2.7 [0.1, 5.4], p < .05), but not content experts (p = .09).conclusionswhen preceptors are physicians, content expertise is not a prerequisite to teach first year medical students within a structured small group environment; preceptors with process expertise result in at least equivalent, if not superior, student outcomes in this setting. purpose: to examine an instrument for evaluating clinical teaching using factor analysis and to refine the validated instrument to a practical length. method: factor analysis on a split sample of 1,581 student evaluations rating 178 teachers. the instrument was based on the seven-category stanford faculty development program's (sfdp's) clinical teaching framework and contained 58 likert-scaled items, with at least seven items per category plus five items measuring “teacher's knowledge.” standard methodology for survey item reduction was used to remove items with low or complex factor loadings and iteratively remove items with low item-scale correlation. results were replicated on the second sample. results: the seven original categories emerged and items originally categorized under “knowledge” statistically combined with “promoting self-directed learning.” over 73% of the variance was explained. item reduction resulted in 25 items with overall internal consistency over .97 and internal consistency of constructs ranging from .82 to .95. conclusions: factor analysis of student ratings validated the seven-category sfdp framework. an abbreviated instrument to measure the seven categories is described. results suggest that students may not systematically distinguish between their teachers' knowledge and their teachers' ability to promote self-directed learning, an important finding for both administrators and faculty development programs.
dendrobatid frogs are among the best known anurans in the world, mainly due to their toxicity and associated bright colors. a recently described dendrobatid genus, andinobates, comprises frogs distributed among the colombian andes and panama. during field work in the distrito de donoso, colón province, panama, we found a poison frog that we here describe as a new species. the new species belongs to the a. minutus species group and is described herein as andinobates geminisae sp. nov. this new species differs from all other members of the group by having uniformly orange smooth skin over the entire body and a distinctive male advertisement call. the new species is smaller than other colorful dendrobatids present in the area, such as oophaga pumilio and o. vicentei. we also provide molecular phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial dna sequences of dendrobatids and summarize genetic distances among andinobates species. andinobates geminisae occurs in caribbean versant rainforest on the westernmost edge of the known distribution of a. minutus, and represents the fourth species within this genus in panama. this is vulnerable to habitat loss and excessive harvesting and requires immediate conservation plans to preserve this species with a restricted geographic range. the poison frogs of the colombian andes, pacific lowlands and panama have been recently recognized as a new, monophyletic and well-supported genus: andinobates. the species richness and distribution within andinobates remain poorly understood due to the paucity of geographic, genetic and phenotypic data. here we use a combination of molecular, bioacoustic and morphometric evidence to describe a new species of andean poison frog: andinobates cassidyhornae sp. nov. from the high elevation cloud forests of the colombian cordillera occidental, in the northwestern andes. the new species is associated to the bombetes group and characterized by a unique combination of ventral and dorsal color patterns. data on 1119 bp from two mitochondrial markers allowed us to reject the null hypotheses that a. cassidyhornae sp. nov. is part of the phenotypically similar and geographically less distant species: a. opisthomelas, a. virolinensis or a. bombetes. the best available phylogenetic trees and the genetic distance to other andinobates species further support this decision. altogether, the advertisement call parameters unambiguously separated a. cassidyhornae sp. nov. calls from the calls of the three closest species. the new species adds to a poorly known and highly endangered genus of poison frogs that requires further studies and urgent conservation measures.
secreted modular calcium-binding protein 2 (smoc2) belongs to the secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (sparc) family of matricellular proteins whose members are known to modulate cell-matrix interactions. we report that smoc2 is upregulated in the kidney tubular epithelial cells of mice and humans following fibrosis. using genetically manipulated mice with smoc2 overexpression or knockdown, we show that smoc2 is critically involved in the progression of kidney fibrosis. mechanistically, we found that smoc2 activates a fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition (fmt) to stimulate stress fiber formation, proliferation, migration, and extracellular matrix production. furthermore, we demonstrate that targeting smoc2 by sirna results in attenuation of tgfβ1-mediated fmt in vitro and an amelioration of kidney fibrosis in mice. these findings implicate that smoc2 is a key signaling molecule in the pathological secretome of a damaged kidney and targeting smoc2 offers a therapeutic strategy for inhibiting fmt-mediated kidney fibrosis - an unmet medical need. research on fibroblast biology in three-dimensional collagen matrices offers new opportunities to understand the reciprocal and adaptive interactions that occur between cells and surrounding matrix in a tissue-like environment. such interactions are integral to the regulation of connective tissue morphogenesis and dynamics that characterizes tissue homeostasis and wound repair. during fibroblast-collagen matrix remodeling, mechanical signals from the remodeled matrix feed back to modulate cell behavior in an iterative process. as mechanical loading (tension) within the matrix increases, the mechanisms used by cells to remodel the matrix change. fibroblasts in matrices that are under tension or relaxed respond differently to growth factor stimulation, and switching between mechanically loaded and unloaded conditions influences whether cells acquire proliferative/biosynthetic active or quiescent/resting phenotypes.
background in patients with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (ahrf) during exacerbations of copd, mortality can be high despite noninvasive ventilation (niv). for some, ahrf is terminal and niv is inappropriate. however there is no definitive method of identifying patients who are unlikely to survive. the aim of this study was to identify factors associated with inpatient mortality from ahrf with respiratory acidosis due to copd. methods copd patients presenting with ahrf and who were treated with niv were studied prospectively. the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (fev1), world health organization performance status (who-ps), clinical observations, a composite physiological score (early warning score), routine hematology and biochemistry, and arterial blood gases prior to commencing niv, were recorded. results in total, 65 patients were included for study, 29 males and 36 females, with a mean age of 71 ± 10.5 years. inpatient mortality in the group was 33.8%. mortality at 30 days and 12 months after admission were 38.5% and 58.5%, respectively. on univariate analysis, the variables associated with inpatient death were: who-ps ≥ 3, long-term oxygen therapy, anemia, diastolic blood pressure < 70 mmhg, early warning score ≥ 3, severe acidosis (ph < 7.20), and serum albumin < 35 g/l. on multivariate analysis, only anemia and who-ps ≥ 3 were significant. the presence of both predicted 68% of inpatient deaths, with a specificity of 98%. conclusion who-ps ≥ 3 and anemia are prognostic factors in ahrf with respiratory acidosis due to copd. a combination of the two provides a simple method of identifying patients unlikely to benefit from niv. the early warning score (ews) is a simple physiological scoring system suitable for bedside application. the ability of a modified early warning score (mews) to identify medical patients at risk of catastrophic deterioration in a busy clinical area was investigated. in a prospective cohort study, we applied mews to patients admitted to the 56-bed acute medical admissions unit (mau) of a district general hospital (dgh). data on 709 medical emergency admissions were collected during march 2000. main outcome measures were death, intensive care unit (icu) admission, high dependency unit (hdu) admission, cardiac arrest, survival and hospital discharge at 60 days. scores of 5 or more were associated with increased risk of death (or 5.4, 95%ci 2.8-10.7), icu admission (or 10.9, 95%ci 2.2-55.6) and hdu admission (or 3.3, 95%ci 1.2-9.2). mews can be applied easily in a dgh medical admission unit, and identifies patients at risk of deterioration who require increased levels of care in the hdu or icu. a clinical pathway could be created, using nurse practitioners and/or critical care physicians, to respond to high scores and intervene with appropriate changes in clinical management.
in image and video denoising, a quantitative measure of genuine image content, noise, and blur is required to facilitate quality assessment, when the ground truth is not available. in this paper, we present a no-reference image quality assessment for denoising applications, which examines local image structure using orientation dominancy and patch sparsity. we propose a fast method to find the dominant orientation of image patches, which is used to decompose them into singular values. combining singular values with the sparsity of the patch in the transform domain, we measure the possible image content and noise of the patches and of the whole image. we show that the proposed method is useful to select parameters of denoising algorithms automatically in different noise scenarios such as white gaussian and processed noise. our objective and subjective results confirm the correspondence between the measured quality and the ground truth. we show that the proposed method rivals related state-of-the-art no-reference quality assessment approaches. sharpness is an important determinant in visual assessment of image quality. the human visual system is able to effortlessly detect blur and evaluate sharpness of visual images, but the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. existing blur/sharpness evaluation algorithms are mostly based on edge width, local gradient, or energy reduction of global/local high frequency content. here we understand the subject from a different perspective, where sharpness is identified as strong local phase coherence (lpc) near distinctive image features evaluated in the complex wavelet transform domain. previous lpc computation is restricted to be applied to complex coefficients spread in three consecutive dyadic scales in the scale-space. here we propose a flexible framework that allows for lpc computation in arbitrary fractional scales. we then develop a new sharpness assessment algorithm without referencing the original image. we use four subject-rated publicly available image databases to test the proposed algorithm, which demonstrates competitive performance when compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.
rhinoscleroma is a chronic granulomatous infection of the upper airways caused by the bacterium klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis. the disease is endemic in tropical and subtropical areas, but its diagnosis remains difficult. as a consequence, and despite available antibiotherapy, some patients evolve advanced stages that can lead to disfiguration, severe respiratory impairment and death by anoxia. because identification of the etiologic agent is crucial for the definitive diagnosis of the disease, the aim of this study was to develop two simple pcr assays. we took advantage of the fact that all klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis isolates are (i) of capsular serotype k3; and (ii) belong to a single clone with diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms (snp). the complete sequence of the genomic region comprising the capsular polysaccharide synthesis (cps) gene cluster was determined. putative functions of the 21 genes identified were consistent with the structure of the k3 antigen. the k3-specific sequence of gene kr11509 (wzy) was exploited to set up a pcr test, which was positive for 40 k3 strains but negative when assayed on the 76 other klebsiella capsular types. further, to discriminate klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis from other k3 klebsiella strains, a specific pcr assay was developed based on diagnostic snps in the phosphate porin gene phoe. this work provides rapid and simple molecular tools to confirm the diagnostic of rhinoscleroma, which should improve patient care as well as knowledge on the prevalence and epidemiology of rhinoscleroma. in escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, the core oligosaccharide backbone of the lipopolysaccharide is modified by phosphoryl groups. the negative charges provided by these residues are important in maintaining the barrier function of the outer membrane. in contrast, klebsiella pneumoniae lacks phosphoryl groups in its core oligosaccharide but instead contains galacturonic acid residues that are proposed to serve a similar function in outer membrane stability. gla(kp) is a udp-galacturonic acid c4-epimerase that provides udp-galacturonic acid for core synthesis, and the enzyme was biochemically characterized because of its potentially important role in outer membrane stability. high-performance anion-exchange chromatography was used to demonstrate the udp-galacturonic acid c4-epimerase activity of gla(kp), and capillary electrophoresis was used for activity assays. the reaction equilibrium favors udp-galacturonic acid over udp-glucuronic acid in a ratio of 1.4:1, with the k(m) for udp-glucuronic acid of 13.0 microm. gla(kp) exists as a dimer in its native form. nad+/nadh is tightly bound by the enzyme and addition of supplementary nad+ is not required for activity of the purified enzyme. divalent cations have an unexpected inhibitory effect on enzyme activity. gla(kp) was found to have a broad substrate specificity in vitro; it is capable of interconverting udp-glucose/udp-galactose and udp-n-acetylglucosamine/udp-n-acetylgalactosamine, albeit at much lower activity. the epimerase gale interconverts udp-glucose/udp-galactose. multicopy plasmid-encoded gla(kp) partially complemented a gale mutation in s. enterica and in k. pneumoniae; however, chromosomal gla(kp) could not substitute for gale in a k. pneumoniae gale mutant in vivo.
magnetization transfer in white matter (wm) causes biexponential relaxation, but most quantitative t1 measurements fit data assuming monoexponential relaxation. the resulting monoexponential t1 estimate varies based on scan parameters and represents a source of variation between studies, especially at high fields. in this study, we characterized wm t1 relaxation and performed simulations to determine how to minimize this deviation. brain water proton (1h2o) longitudinal relaxation time constants (t1) were obtained from three healthy individuals at magnetic field strengths (b0) of 0.2 tesla (t), 1.0t, 1.5t, 4.0t, and 7.0t. a 5‐mm midventricular axial slice was sampled using a modified look‐locker technique with 1.5 mm in‐plane resolution, and 32 time points post‐adiabatic inversion. the results confirmed that for most brain tissues, t1 values increased by more than a factor of 3 between 0.2t and 7t, and over this range were well fitted by t1 (s) = 0.583(b0)0.382, t1(s) = 0.857(b0)0.376, and t1(s) = 1.35(b0)0.340 for white matter (wm), internal gm, and blood 1h2o, respectively. the ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (csf) 1h2o t1 value did not change with b0, and its average value (standard deviation (sd)) across subjects and magnetic fields was 4.3 (±0.2) s. the tissue 1/t1 values at each field were well correlated with the macromolecular mass fraction, and to a lesser extent tissue iron content. the field‐dependent increases in 1h2o t1 values more than offset the well‐known decrease in typical mri contrast reagent (cr) relaxivity, and simulations predict that this leads to lower cr concentration detection thresholds with increased magnetic field. magn reson med 57:308–318, 2007. © 2007 wiley‐liss, inc.
background early postoperative physical activity in elderly patients suffering from proximal femoral fractures may reduce mortality. we hypothesized that activity trackers can reliably and objectively monitor the in-hospital mobilization, correlating with functional independence and quality of life. methods three different tracker types (fitbit™ flex, misfit™ shine, and axivity ax3) at three locations (wrist, ankle, and femur) recorded steps and signal vector magnitudes (svm) in 22 patients. they were 81 ± 8 years old, were equally distributed between the sexes, and had an asa score of 2.5 ± 0.6. single protocoled activity events (n = 191) were clinically categorized into 4 levels and correlated with the monitored signals. additionally, 2 ± 1 and 8 ± 3 days after the operation, the euroqol-5d and the barthel-20 index supplemented this data. results all measurements at the wrist (fitbit, misfit) resulted in unacceptable accuracy; however, sensitivity and specificity reached around 90% using the misfit at the ankle. applying this combination, the correlation between real and measured steps (r2 = 0.99) and the category discrimination were statistically significant (p < 0.002). a discriminant analysis featured the calculation of four activity levels based on svm measurements using the axivity tracker at the femur. a cluster analysis showed a 100% agreement between the clinically observed and the calculated activity levels. the amount of active minutes or periods and both the euroqol-5d and the barthel-20 indices significantly increased between the analyzed time points after the operation. however, only the barthel-20 was associated with the measured activity levels (p < 0.01). conclusion the misfit and the axivity trackers can reliably monitor activity in elderly patients after operative treatment of proximal femur fractures. however, the wear location is decisive. objectively measured activity correlated with functional independence and quality of life. we have studied the effect of shortening of the femoral neck and varus collapse on the functional capacity and quality of life of patients who had undergone fixation of an isolated intracapsular fracture of the hip with cancellous screws. after screening 660 patients at four university medical centres, 70 patients with a mean age of 71 years (20 to 90) met the inclusion criteria. overall, 66% (46 of 70) of the fractures healed with > 5 mm of shortening and 39% (27 of 70) with > 5 degrees of varus. patients with severe shortening of the femoral neck had significantly lower short form-36 questionnaire (sf-36) physical functioning scores (no/mild (<5 mm) vs severe shortening (> 10 mm); 74 vs 42 points, p < 0.001). a similar effect was noted with moderate shortening, suggesting a gradient effect (no/mild (< 5 mm) vs moderate shortening (5 to 10 mm); 74 vs 53 points, p = 0.011). varus collapse correlated moderately with the occurrence of shortening (r = 0.66, p < 0.001). shortening also resulted in a significantly lower euroqol questionnaire (eq5d) index scores (p = 0.05). in a regression analysis shortening of the femoral neck was the only significant variable predictive of a low sf-36 physical functioning score (p < 0.001).
aims/hypothesisdiabetic kidney disease (dkd) is a microvascular complication associated with poor control of blood glucose and bp. we aimed to evaluate the predictors of development and progression of dkd in a cohort of high-risk individuals with type 2 diabetes, placing emphasis on ambulatory bp and arterial stiffness.methodsin a prospective study, 629 individuals without advanced renal failure had their renal function evaluated annually over a median follow-up period of 7.8 years. ambulatory bp was monitored and aortic stiffness was assessed by carotid–femoral pulse wave velocity at baseline. multivariate competing risks analysis with all-cause mortality, using the fine and gray approach, was used to examine the independent predictors of development and progression of dkd, a composite of development or progression of abnormal albuminuria and worsening of renal function (doubling of serum creatinine or progression to end-stage renal disease).resultsat baseline, 197 individuals had dkd. during follow-up, dkd developed or progressed in 195 individuals, abnormal albuminuria developed or progressed in 125 individuals and renal function deteriorated in 91. after adjustments for baseline albuminuria and renal function, age, sex, diabetes duration and use of renin–angiotensin antagonists, poorer control of blood glucose (hr 1.17; 95% ci 0.98, 1.40; p = 0.09 for each 1 sd increment in mean first-year hba1c), higher ambulatory systolic bp (hr 1.28; 95% ci 1.09, 1.50; p = 0.003, for each 1 sd increase in daytime systolic bp [sbp]) and increased aortic stiffness (hr 1.16; 95% ci 1.00, 1.34; p = 0.05) were independent predictors of development or progression of dkd. at baseline, ambulatory bp was a stronger predictor than bp measured in the clinic. aortic stiffness predicted abnormal albuminuria development or progression (hr 1.26; 95% ci 1.02, 1.56; p = 0.036) whereas ambulatory bp was a stronger predictor of renal function deterioration (hr 1.32; 95% ci 1.09, 1.60; p = 0.005 for daytime sbp).conclusions/interpretationpoor blood glucose and bp control and increased aortic stiffness were the main predictors of development or progression of dkd; ambulatory sbp was a better predictor than bp measured in the clinic. ambulatory bp monitoring and assessment of aortic stiffness should be more widely used in clinical type 2 diabetes management. objective the action in diabetes and vascular disease: preterax and diamicron mr controlled evaluation (advance) trial reported that intensive glucose control prevents end-stage kidney disease (eskd) in patients with type 2 diabetes, but uncertainty about the balance between risks and benefits exists. here, we examine the long-term effects of intensive glucose control on risk of eskd and other outcomes. research design and methods survivors, previously randomized to intensive or standard glucose control, were invited to participate in post-trial follow-up. eskd, defined as the need for dialysis or kidney transplantation, or death due to kidney disease, was documented overall and by baseline ckd stage, along with hypoglycemic episodes, major cardiovascular events, and death from other causes. results a total of 8,494 advance participants were followed for a median of 5.4 additional years. in-trial hba1c differences disappeared by the first post-trial visit. the in-trial reductions in the risk of eskd (7 vs. 20 events, hazard ratio [hr] 0.35, p = 0.02) persisted after 9.9 years of overall follow-up (29 vs. 53 events, hr 0.54, p < 0.01). these effects were greater in earlier-stage ckd (p = 0.04) and at lower baseline systolic blood pressure levels (p = 0.01). the effects of glucose lowering on the risks of death, cardiovascular death, or major cardiovascular events did not differ by levels of kidney function (p > 0.26). conclusions intensive glucose control was associated with a long-term reduction in eskd, without evidence of any increased risk of cardiovascular events or death. these benefits were greater with preserved kidney function and with well-controlled blood pressure.
abstract magnetotactic bacteria (mtb) in the phylum nitrospirae synthesize up to hundreds of intracellular bullet-shaped magnetite magnetosomes. in the present study, a watermelon-shaped magnetotactic bacterium (designated mwb-1) from lake beihai in beijing, china, was characterized. this uncultivated microbe was identified as a member of the phylum nitrospirae and represents a novel phylogenetic lineage with ≥6% 16s rrna gene sequence divergence from all currently described mtb. mwb-1 contained 200 to 300 intracellular bullet-shaped magnetite magnetosomes and showed a helical swimming trajectory under homogeneous magnetic fields; its magnetotactic velocity decreased with increasing field strength, and vice versa. a robust phylogenetic framework for mwb-1 and all currently known mtb in the phylum nitrospirae was constructed utilizing maximum-likelihood and bayesian algorithms, which yielded strong evidence that the nitrospirae mtb could be divided into four well-supported groups. considering its population densities in sediment and its high numbers of magnetosomes, mwb-1 was estimated to account for more than 10% of the natural remanent magnetization of the surface sediment. taken together, the results of this study suggest that mtb in the phylum nitrospirae are more diverse than previously realized and can make important contributions to the sedimentary magnetization in particular environments. a combination of polymerase chain reaction-assisted rrna sequence retrieval and fluorescent oligonucleotide probing was used to identify in situ a hitherto unculturable, big, magnetotactic, rod-shaped organism in freshwater sediment samples collected from lake chiemsee. tentatively named "magnetobacterium bavaricum," this bacterium is evolutionarily distant from all other phylogenetically characterized magnetotactic bacteria and contains unusually high numbers of magnetosomes (up to 1,000 magnetosomes per cell). the spatial distribution in the sediment was studied, and up to 7 x 10 active cells per cm were found in the microaerobic zone. considering its average volume (25.8 +/- 4.1 mum) and relative abundance (0.64 +/- 0.17%), "m. bavaricum" may account for approximately 30% of the microbial biovolume and may therefore be a dominant fraction of the microbial community in this layer. its microhabitat and its high content of sulfur globules and magnetosomes suggest that this organism has an iron-dependent way of energy conservation which depends on balanced gradients of oxygen and sulfide.
persistent postconcussion syndrome (pcs) occurs in around 5–10% of individuals after mild traumatic brain injury (mtbi), but research into the underlying biology of these ongoing symptoms is limited and inconsistent. one reason for this could be the heterogeneity inherent to mtbi, with individualized injury mechanisms and psychological factors. a multimodal imaging study may be able to characterize the injury better. objectives to examine patterns of brain activation while performing a working memory task in persons with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (tbi) and healthy controls. it is well established that working memory is an area of cognition that is especially vulnerable to disruption after tbi. although much has been learned about the system of cerebral representation of working memory in healthy people, little is known about how this system is disrupted by tbi.   methods functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) was used to assess brain activation during a working memory task (a modified version of the paced auditory serial addition test) in nine patients with tbi and seven healthy controls.   results patients with tbi were able to perform the task, but made significantly more errors than healthy controls. cerebral activation in both groups was found in similar regions of the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, and resembled patterns of activation found in previous neuroimaging studies of working memory in healthy persons. however, compared with the healthy controls, the tbi group displayed a pattern of cerebral activation that was more regionally dispersed and more lateralised to the right hemisphere. differences in lateralisation were particularly evident in the frontal lobes.   conclusions impairment of working memory in tbi seems to be associated with alterations in functional cerebral activity.
abstract    cyclophilin a (cypa) is an important host factor in the replication of a variety of rna viruses. also the replication of several nidoviruses was reported to depend on cypa, although possibly not to the same extent. these prior studies are difficult to compare, since different nidoviruses, cell lines and experimental set-ups were used. here, we investigated the cypa dependence of three distantly related nidoviruses that can all replicate in huh7 cells: the arterivirus equine arteritis virus (eav), the alphacoronavirus human coronavirus 229e (hcov-229e), and the betacoronavirus middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov). the replication of these viruses was compared in the same parental huh7 cells and in cypa-knockout huh7 cells generated using crispr/cas9-technology. cypa depletion reduced eav yields by ~ 3-log, whereas mers-cov progeny titers were modestly reduced (3-fold) and hcov-229e replication was unchanged. this study reveals that the replication of nidoviruses can differ strikingly in its dependence on cellular cypa. the gene expression of plus-strand rna viruses with a polycistronic genome depends on translation and replication of the genomic mrna, as well as synthesis of subgenomic (sg) mrnas. arteriviruses and coronaviruses, distantly related members of the nidovirus order, employ a unique mechanism of discontinuous minus-strand rna synthesis to generate subgenome-length templates for the synthesis of a nested set of sg mrnas. non-structural protein 1 (nsp1) of the arterivirus equine arteritis virus (eav), a multifunctional regulator of viral rna synthesis and virion biogenesis, was previously implicated in controlling the balance between genome replication and sg mrna synthesis. here, we employed reverse and forward genetics to gain insight into the multiple regulatory roles of nsp1. our analysis revealed that the relative abundance of viral mrnas is tightly controlled by an intricate network of interactions involving all nsp1 subdomains. distinct nsp1 mutations affected the quantitative balance among viral mrna species, and our data implicate nsp1 in controlling the accumulation of full-length and subgenome-length minus-strand templates for viral mrna synthesis. the moderate differential changes in viral mrna abundance of nsp1 mutants resulted in similarly altered viral protein levels, but progeny virus yields were greatly reduced. pseudorevertant analysis provided compelling genetic evidence that balanced eav mrna accumulation is critical for efficient virus production. this first report on protein-mediated, mrna-specific control of nidovirus rna synthesis reveals the existence of an integral control mechanism to fine-tune replication, sg mrna synthesis, and virus production, and establishes a major role for nsp1 in coordinating the arterivirus replicative cycle.
develop a framework for efficient free‐breathing simultaneous whole‐heart coronary magnetic resonance angiography (cmra) and cardiac positron emission tomography (pet) on a 3 tesla pet‐mr system. noninvasive imaging plays a central role in the diagnosis of heart failure, assessment of prognosis, and monitoring of therapy. cardiovascular magnetic resonance (cmr) offers a comprehensive assessment of heart failure patients and is now the gold standard imaging technique to assess myocardial anatomy, regional and global function, and viability. furthermore, it allows assessment of perfusion and acute tissue injury (edema and necrosis), whereas in nonischemic heart failure, fibrosis, infiltration, and iron overload can be detected. the information derived from cmr often reveals the underlying etiology of heart failure, and its high measurement accuracy makes it an ideal technique for monitoring disease progression and the effects of treatment. evidence on the prognostic value of cmr-derived parameters in heart failure is rapidly emerging. this review summarizes the advantages of cmr for patients with heart failure and its important role in key areas.
context. radioiodine (rai) administration has adverse effects in patients treated for thyroid cancer (dtc), but there is scarce information regarding their intensity and duration. objective. to evaluate frequency and intensity of early and late rai-related symptoms in patients with dtc. design. observational prospective study. patients. dtc patients who underwent thyroidectomy, with or without rai. measurements. patients answered 2 surveys: (1) from 0 to 6 months and (2) between 6 and 18 months after initial treatment. results. 110 patients answered the first survey and 61 both. nearly 80 percent received rai. among early symptoms, periorbital edema, excessive tearing, salivary gland disturbances, dry mouth, taste disorders, and nausea were more frequent and intense among rai patients. regarding late symptoms, periorbital edema, salivary gland pain and swelling, and dry mouth were more frequent and intense in rai patients. frequency and intensity of adverse effects were not different between low and high rai doses (50 versus ≥100 mci). conclusion. rai-related symptoms are frequent and usually persist after 6 months of administration, even when low doses are given. this finding must be considered when deciding rai administration, especially in low risk patients, among whom rai benefit is controversial. salivary gland side effects (sses) can be a source of significant morbidity in thyroid cancer patients receiving radioactive iodine (rai) for remnant ablation or therapy. however, the incidence, time course, and ultimate resolution of sses that develop in the first few months after a single administered activity of rai for remnant ablation has not be adequately defined. methods: we retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of patients after rai remnant ablation (rra) to determine the incidence of salivary gland–related side effects reported within the first year of rra, the dose-response relationship between administered activity and specific sses, and the incidence of specific sses based on the method of preparation for remnant ablation (recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone [rhtsh] vs. traditional thyroid hormone withdrawal [thw]). results: sses were reported within the first year of rai ablation in 39% of a cohort of 262 patients (66% women, 93% papillary thyroid cancer; median dose, 5,217 mbq [141 mci]). persistent side effects were noted after a median of 7 y in 5% or less of the entire cohort. however, when side effects developed in patients during the first year, the incidence of persistence of the symptom at last follow-up ranged from 5% to 13%. a statistically significant dose response was seen between administered activity of rai and development of salivary gland swelling (p = 0.001, logistic dose-response curve) but not with dry mouth (p = 0.63), altered taste (p = 0.27), or salivary gland pain (p = 0.152). sses developed in 14% of patients receiving administered activities of 1,110 mbq (30 mci); administered activities of 2,775 mbq (75 mci) or more were associated with symptoms in 40% of patients (p = 0.046). despite receiving a statistically higher administered activity (5,661 ± 2,997 mbq [153 ± 81 mci] for thw vs. 4,958 ± 2,294 mbq [134 ± 62 mci] for rhtsh), thw was associated with a lower rate of salivary gland swelling than the rhtsh preparation (20% vs. 10%; p = 0.017), without differences in the development of dry mouth, altered taste, or salivary gland pain. conclusion: although sses occurred in 39% of patients after routine rra, they were usually transient, so that the overall incidence of persistent side effects at a median follow-up of 7 y was only 5%. even though the risk for persistent side effects is rather small, these data do emphasize the need to select patients carefully for rra who are thought to be at moderate to high risk for recurrence and to use the minimally effective dose of rai activity, in an attempt to maximize the potential benefit while minimizing the risk for adverse events for an individual patient.
during refuelling, people may easily be exposed to extremely high levels of gasoline vapour for a short time, although such exposure takes on more importance in the case of service station attendants. the volume of gasoline sold in refuelling operations and the ambient temperature can significantly increase the environmental level of benzene, toluene and xylene (btx) vapours and, subsequently, the occupational risk of service station attendants. this is especially true in the case of benzene, the most important component of gasoline vapours from a toxicological point of view. the european directive 98/70/ec, limiting the benzene composition of gasoline, and 94/63/ec, concerning the use of vapour recovery systems in the delivery of gasoline to services stations, were applied in spain from january 2000 and 2002, respectively. in addition, a new limit value for occupational exposure of 3.25 mg/m(3) was fixed for benzene in directive 97/42/ec, applied from june 2003. however, recent years have seen the growing use of diesel as well as of unleaded and reformulated gasoline. in this study, we analyse the differences found between air concentration levels of btxs in 2000 and 2003, analysing samples taken from the personal breathing-zone of occupationally exposed workers in service stations. the results are compared with those obtained in a similar study carried out in 1995 (before the new regulations came into force). the study was carried out in two phases. the first phase was carried out in 2000, after application of the new legal regulation limiting the benzene concentration in gasoline. in this case, an occupationally exposed population of 28 service station attendants was sampled in july, with a mean ambient temperature of 30-31 degrees c. in the second phase, 19 exposed subjects were sampled in july 2003, one of the warmest months in recent years with mean temperatures of 35-36 degrees c during the time of exposure monitoring. the results were then compared with those obtained in 1995, for similar summer weather conditions (environmental temperature between 28 and 30 degrees c). a significant relationship between the volume of gasoline sold and the ambient concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons was found for each worker sampled in all three of the years. furthermore, a significant decrease in the environmental levels of btxs was observed after january 2000, especially in the case of benzene, with mean time-weighted average concentrations for 8 h of 736 microg/m(3) (range 272-1603) in 1995, 241 microg/m(3) (range 115-453) in 2000 and 163 microg/m(3) (range 36-564) in 2003, despite the high temperatures reached in the last mentioned year. work on deck on eight oil product tankers was examined. the purpose was to evaluate the need for improvement of the working environment to reduce the risk of occupational cancer. benzene, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) and organic lead compounds were sampled, and the crew answered a questionnaire on acute health effects. by area monitoring, benzene was generally found to be in the range from the detection limit, of 0.01 ppm, up to 1.15 ppm, but one tanker which loaded gasoline with the hatches open had levels up to 55 ppm. personal monitoring showed exposure levels in the range 0.01-1.15 ppm. the pah-levels and the levels of organic lead were low. no seamen were observed using respiratory protective equipment. central nervous system symptoms were reported by the crew with the highest exposures to benzene although benzene may not be the only cause. the exposure to benzene and other hydrocarbons on the deck of oil product tankers ought to be reduced.
while many papers propose innovative methods for constructing individual rules in separate-and-conquer rule learning algorithms, comparatively few study the heuristic rule evaluation functions used in these algorithms to ensure that the selected rules combine into a good rule set. underestimating the impact of this component has led to suboptimal design choices in many algorithms. the main goal of this paper is to demonstrate the importance of heuristic rule evaluation functions by improving existing rule induction techniques and to provide guidelines for algorithm designers. we first select optimal heuristic rule learning functions for several metaheuristic-based algorithms and empirically compare the resulting heuristics across algorithms. this results in large and significant improvements of the predictive accuracy for two techniques. we find that despite the absence of a global optimal choice for all algorithms, good default choices can be shared across algorithms with similar search biases. a near-optimal selection can thus be found for new algorithms with minor experimental tuning. lastly, a major contribution is made towards balancing a model’s predictive accuracy with its comprehensibility. we construct a pareto front of optimal solutions for this trade-off and show that gains in comprehensibility and/or accuracy are possible for the techniques studied. the parametrized heuristics enable users to select the desired balance as they offer a high flexibility when it comes to selecting the desired accuracy and comprehensibility in rule miners. discrete values have important roles in data mining and knowledge discovery. they are about intervals of numbers which are more concise to represent and specify, easier to use and comprehend as they are closer to a knowledge-level representation than continuous values. many studies show induction tasks can benefit from discretization: rules with discrete values are normally shorter and more understandable and discretization can lead to improved predictive accuracy. furthermore, many induction algorithms found in the literature require discrete features. all these prompt researchers and practitioners to discretize continuous features before or during a machine learning or data mining task. there are numerous discretization methods available in the literature. it is time for us to examine these seemingly different methods for discretization and find out how different they really are, what are the key components of a discretization process, how we can improve the current level of research for new development as well as the use of existing methods. this paper aims at a systematic study of discretization methods with their history of development, effect on classification, and trade-off between speed and accuracy. contributions of this paper are an abstract description summarizing existing discretization methods, a hierarchical framework to categorize the existing methods and pave the way for further development, concise discussions of representative discretization methods, extensive experiments and their analysis, and some guidelines as to how to choose a discretization method under various circumstances. we also identify some issues yet to solve and future research for discretization.
abstractbio-inspired metal nanomaterials are receiving increasing research attentions in catalytic field recently, while peptide-based method represents new revenues to fabricate stable and reactive catalyst under mild and environmental friendly conditions. among all kinds of noble metals, peptide-based palladium nanomaterials have demonstrated excellent catalytic capabilities in a variety of organic reactions. however, their electrocatalytic properties have not been systematically studied. herein, r5-templated pd nanomaterials have been fabricated and employed as potent catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (orr). the shape and morphology of these pd nanomaterials were manipulated by tuning the metal-to-r5 ratio. the as-prepared pd nanomaterials demonstrated excellent orr activity in alkaline media. r5-pd-90 exhibited the best activity which is superior than commercial pt/c, in terms of onset potential, diffusion-limited current density as well as long-term stability. the correlation between the shape and/or morphology of the peptide-templated pd nanomaterials and their orr activity has been successfully established. abstract peptide-capped nanoparticles represent a unique type of nanomaterials with emergent optical and electrochemical properties. herein, a series of peptide capped palladium nanoparticles have been prepared and employed as highly efficient catalysts for oxygen electroreduction. the peptide sequence was tuned by substituting amino acid residues at specialized positions, and strong surface effects were observed between the peptide sequence and the electrocatalytic activity. the findings corresponded well with the previously reported c c coupling catalytic reactions, indicating that the residue-specific binding effects but not the overall binding strength governed the electrocatalytic activity. the results may shed light on the rational design of bio-inspired nanomaterials with optimized electrocatalytic properties.
we consider the following problem: find a fixed-order linear controller that maximizes the closed-loop asymptotic decay rate for the classical two-mass-spring system. this can be formulated as the problem of minimizing the abscissa (maximum of the real parts of the roots) of a polynomial whose coefficients depend linearly on the controller parameters. we show that the only order for which there is a non-trivial solution is 2. in this case, we derive a controller that we prove locally maximizes the asymptotic decay rate, using recently developed techniques from nonsmooth analysis. tih purp of this pape is to furter invesigae a simp , yet meaningf, control problm to higkhl bue in robus coutolr desig and to demote the appicat of a risty of robus control deign methodologa the problm ha bee studied by seeal researc under a vart of [1mor recent, this problm wa formulmaed and addrsd a benchmak problem for robut control deign 110-16]. in our flatio of the probem ertain apcts, sach a pameter ueaint with nominal value ad nomina deeired performance, ar concrtely, whie othr aspects, such the mesnset nois model, deuita of setig time, measur of control dford, contrle coplexity, bandwt, etc., ar dft vage each designw is thus the opportunt to emp addionl deign tradeoffs adesfred.
our central nervous system is based on the generation and propagation of electrical signals along the neuronal pathways. these variations of the membrane potential are arranged by the concerted action of ion channels in the neuronal membrane. therefore, the exact measurement of the electric field in the central nervous system is the focus of intensive investigation. while electrophysiological methods provide exact measurements on the single-cell or single-molecule level with high temporal resolution, they are limited in their spatial resolution ranging from a few single cells to a single molecule. to thoroughly understand how the voltage-dependent ion channels sense the membrane potential and are precisely gated by it, the electric field within the protein has to be investigated. likewise, the propagation of electrical impulses in a network of neurons involves a large number of cells, which have to be monitored simultaneously. for these endeavors, optical methods have proven to be useful due to their scalability, temporal and spatial resolution. here, we will summarize the properties of the optical probes that we used to determine the electrical field strength within voltage-sensitive ion channels and discuss the hybrid approach to detect membrane potential changes in genetically specified neurons in terms of design, limitations and future developments. we constructed a novel optical indicator for chloride ions by fusing the chloride-sensitive yellow fluorescent protein with the chloride-insensitive cyan fluorescent protein. the ratio of fret-dependent emission of these fluorophores varied in proportion to the concentration of cl and was used to measure intracellular chloride concentration ([cl-]i) in cultured hippocampal neurons. [cl-]i decreased during neuronal development, consistent with the shift from excitation to inhibition during maturation of gabaergic synapses. focal activation of gabaa receptors caused large changes in [cl-]i that could underlie use-dependent depression of gaba-dependent synaptic transmission. gaba-induced changes in somatic [cl-]i spread into dendrites, suggesting that [cl-]i can signal the location of synaptic activity. this genetically encoded indicator will permit new approaches ranging from high-throughput drug screening to direct recordings of synaptic cl- signals in vivo.
molecular phylogenetic analyses of 93 new and 198 non-redundant genbank rbcl sequences of the family desmidiaceae (zygnematophyceae, streptophyta) established 22 mostly highly supported clades, in addition to four non-supported lineages and eight single-taxon branches within the family. nine novel clades and single-taxon branches were identified, suggesting that current taxon sampling has not reached saturation in the family. the highly polyphyletic nature of most desmid genera corroborated in this study using a large taxon set, calls for re-evaluation of the genus concept in the family desmidiaceae that traditionally relied on features of cell morphology. molecular phylogenetic data have shown that these morphological characters are highly homoplastic or plesiomorphic and thus cannot be used to delineate genera. the dramatic discrepancy between the currently practised systematic treatment of the family and the composition of the clades based on sequence comparisons requires emendation of almost all existing genera and description of a larger number of novel genera. the clades identified during this study provide a framework for the future emendation/description of genera in the desmidiaceae. dambe (data analysis in molecular biology and evolution) is an integrated software package for converting, manipulating, statistically and graphically describing, and analyzing molecular sequence data with a user-friendly windows 95/98/2000/nt interface. dambe is free and can be downloaded from http://web.hku.hk/~xxia/software/software.htm. the current version is 4.0.36.
purpose to examine whether traditional and cyber bullying victimization were associated with adolescent's mental health problems and suicidal ideation at two-year follow-up. gender differences were explored to determine whether bullying affects boys and girls differently. methods a two-year longitudinal study was conducted among first-year secondary school students (n = 3181). traditional and cyber bullying victimization were assessed at baseline, whereas mental health status and suicidal ideation were assessed at baseline and follow-up by means of self-report questionnaires. logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess associations between these variables while controlling for baseline problems. additionally, we tested whether gender differences in mental health and suicidal ideation were present for the two types of bullying. results there was a significant interaction between gender and traditional bullying victimization and between gender and cyber bullying victimization on mental health problems. among boys, traditional and cyber bullying victimization were not related to mental health problems after controlling for baseline mental health. among girls, both traditional and cyber bullying victimization were associated with mental health problems after controlling for baseline mental health. no significant interaction between gender and traditional or cyber bullying victimization on suicidal ideation was found. traditional bullying victimization was associated with suicidal ideation, whereas cyber bullying victimization was not associated with suicidal ideation after controlling for baseline suicidal ideation. conclusions traditional bullying victimization is associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation, whereas traditional, as well as cyber bullying victimization is associated with an increased risk of mental health problems among girls. these findings stress the importance of programs aimed at reducing bullying behavior, especially because early-onset mental health problems may pose a risk for the development of psychiatric disorders in adulthood. abstract. this study was a first attempt to examine the psychometric properties of the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (sdq) in dutch youths. a large sample of normal children and adolescents (n = 562) and their parents completed the sdq along with a number of other psychopathology measures. factor analysis of the sdq yielded five factors that were in keeping with the hypothesised subscales of hyperactivity-inattention, emotional symptoms, peer problems, conduct problems, and prosocial behaviour. furthermore, internal consistency, test-retest stability, and parent-youth agreement of the various sdq scales were acceptable. finally, the concurrent validity of the sdq was good: that is, its scores correlated in a theoretically meaningful way with other measures of psychopathology. it can be concluded that the psychometric properties of the parent- and self-report version of the sdq were satisfactory in this dutch community sample. moreover, the current data provide further support for the utility of the sdq as an index of psychopathological symptoms in youths.
an adaptive hybrid filter (ahf) with generated information of inertial/magnetic sensor is designed for the fast divergence of gyro errors and the disturbance of noises in the human-motion-capture system (hmcs). to address the challenges of the disturbance of noises in hmcs, we propose a novel scheme of filter fusion algorithm using inertial measurement unit and magnetometers. gauss-newton algorithm (gna) is used to process the accelerometer and magnetic data. the sensor fusion between attitude angle from gna and gyroscope data are performed using the complementary filter. ahf can modify adaptively the parameter, thus enhancing the robustness. evaluating the proposed scheme in magnetic field and sudden acceleration environments, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed can achieve the accurate reproduction of hmcs. this paper considers the question of using a nonlinear complementary filter for attitude estimation of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (uav) given only measurements from a low-cost inertial measurement unit. a nonlinear complementary filter is proposed that combines accelerometer output for low frequency attitude estimation with integrated gyrometer output for high frequency estimation. the raw accelerometer output includes a component corresponding to airframe acceleration, occurring primarily when the aircraft turns, as well as the gravitational acceleration that is required for the filter. the airframe acceleration is estimated using a simple centripetal force model (based on additional airspeed measurements), augmented by a first order dynamic model for angle-of-attack, and used to obtain estimates of the gravitational direction independent of the airplane manoeuvres. experimental results are provided on a real-world data set and the performance of the filter is evaluated against the output from a full gps/ins that was available for the data set.
waterborne epidemics of tularaemia caused by francisella tularensis are increasingly reported in turkey. we have used whole genome sequencing to investigate if f. tularensis isolated from patients could be traced back to drinking water sources. tonsil swabs from 33 patients diagnosed with oropharyngeal tularaemia in three outbreaks and 140 water specimens were analysed. f. tularensis subsp. holarctica was confirmed by microagglutination and pcr in 12 patients and five water specimens. genomic analysis of three pairs of patient and water isolates from outbreaks in sivas, çorum, and kocaeli showed the isolates to belong to two new clusters of the f. tularensis b.12 genetic clade. the clusters were defined by 19 and 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in a multiple alignment based on 507 f. tularensis genomes. one synonymous snp was chosen as a new canonical snp (cansnp) for each cluster for future use in diagnostic assays. no snp was identified between the genomes from the patient–water pair of isolates from kocaeli, one snp between the pair of isolates from sivas, whereas the pair from çorum differed at seven snps. these results illustrate the power of whole genome sequencing for tracing f. tularensis patient isolates back to their environmental source. tularemia is an endemic disease in turkey. in this study, we aimed to detect francisella tularensis by two methods from natural water supplies thought to cause tularemia epidemiologically. a total of 154 water specimens from three different outbreaks caused by drinking water were collected. water specimens were cultured on antibiotic-added cysteine heart agar base with blood and incubated at 37°c in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% co2 for 4–10 days. the suspected colonies were confirmed by f. tularensis antiserum (bd) and the real-time taqman polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. dna was isolated from samples obtained from filters. the primer and probe sets targeting the isftu2 genome were used. a total of four f. tularensis isolates were obtained from 154 water samples. at the same time, the presence of f. tularensis dna from 17 water specimens was shown by the real-time taqman pcr method. although the dna presence of f. tularensis has been detected from water sources by the pcr method in turkey up to now, there has been no isolation directly from water specimens by culture. in this study, the determination of f. tularensis from water sources has been exhibited as the first data by both culture and real-time taqman pcr methods.
all brain functions require the coordinated activity of many neurons, and therefore there is considerable interest in estimating the amount of information that the discharge of a neural population transmits to its targets. in the past, such estimates had presented a significant challenge for populations of more than a few neurons, but we have recently described a novel method for providing such estimates for populations of essentially arbitrary size. here, we explore the influence of some important aspects of the neuronal population discharge on such estimates. in particular, we investigate the roles of mean firing rate and of the degree and nature of correlations among neurons. the results provide constraints on the applicability of our new method and should help neuroscientists determine whether such an application is appropriate for their data. information theory started and, according to some, ended with shannon’s seminal paper “a mathematical theory of communication” (shannon 1948). because its significance and flexibility were quickly recognized, there were numerous attempts to apply it to diverse fields outside of its original scope. this prompted shannon to write his famous essay “the bandwagon” (shannon 1956), warning against indiscriminate use of the new tool. nevertheless, non-standard applications of information theory persisted.    very soon after shannon’s initial publication (shannon 1948), several manuscripts provided the foundations of much of the current use of information theory in neuroscience. mackay and mcculloch (1952) applied the concept of information to propose limits of the transmission capacity of a nerve cell. this work foreshadowed future work on what can be termed “neural information flow”—how much information moves through the nervous system, and the constraints that information theory imposes on the capabilities of neural systems for communication, computation and behavior. a second set of manuscripts, by attneave (1954) and barlow (1961), discussed information as a constraint on neural system structure and function, proposing that neural structure in sensory system is matched to statistical structure of the sensory environment, in a way to optimize information transmission. this is the main idea behind the “structure from information” line of research that is still very active today. a third thread, “reliable computation with noisy/faulty elements”, started both in the information-theoretic community (shannon and mccarthy 1956) and neuro-science (winograd and cowan 1963). with the advent of integrated circuits that were essentially faultless, interest began to wane. however, as ic technology continues to push towards smaller and faster computational elements (even at the expense of reliability), and as neuromorphic systems are developed with variability designed in (merolla and boahen 2006), this topic is gaining in popularity again in the electronics community, and neuroscientists again may have something to contribute to the discussion.
virtually all in vitro studies of the effects of rhinovirus on human airway epithelium have used cells grown under conditions known to produce low levels of differentiation. the relevance of the results to native epithelium is questionable. here we grew primary cultures of human tracheal or nasal epithelium under three conditions. one condition produced pseudostratified, mucociliary cells virtually indistinguishable from native epithelium. the other two conditions produced undifferentiated squamous cells lacking cilia. cells were infected for 6 h with rhinovirus-16. after a 24-h incubation period, we determined levels of viral rna in the cells, numbers of infectious viral particles released in the mucosal medium, expression of a variety of epithelial cytokines and other proteins, release of il-6 and il-8, and transepithelial electrical resistance and voltage. after infection, levels of viral rna in the poorly differentiated cells were 30 or 130 times those in the differentiated. furthermore, expression of mrna for inflammatory cytokines, release of infectious particles, and release of il-6 and il-8 were closely correlated with the degree of viral infection. thus well-differentiated cells are much more resistant to viral infection and its functional consequences than are poorly differentiated cells from the same source. comprehensive and systematic analysis of airway gene expression represents a strategy for addressing the multiple, complex, and largely untested hypotheses that exist for disease mechanisms, including asthma. here, we report a novel real-time pcr-based method specifically designed for quantification of multiple low-abundance transcripts using as little as 2.5 fg of total rna per gene. this method of gene expression profiling has the same specificity and sensitivity as rt-pcr and a throughput level comparable to low-density dna microarray hybridization. in this two-step method, multiplex rt-pcr is successfully combined with individual gene quantification via real-time pcr on generated cdna product. using this method, we measured the expression of 75 genes in bronchial biopsies from asthmatic versus healthy subjects and found expected increases in expression levels of th2 cytokines and their receptors in asthma. surprisingly, we also found increased gene expression of nkcc1--a na+-k+-cl- cotransporter. using immunohistochemical method, we confirmed increased protein expression for nkcc1 in the asthmatic subject with restricted localization to goblet cells. these data validate the new transcriptional profiling method and implicate nkcc1 in the pathophysiology of mucus hypersecretion in asthma. potential applications for this method include transcriptional profiling in limited numbers of laser captured cells and validation of dna microarray data in clinical specimens.
more video content is being produced by production companies and professional videographers than ever before thanks to the adoption of digital media technologies at every stage of the production pipeline. with hundreds of hours of footage being captured by even a small production company, organising and searching these collections has become a very challenging and time-consuming task. this thesis aims to investigate online video annotation for broadcast media production, including scalable video concept detection and object localisation. most production tools and research focuses on asset management of large-scale video collections, but we also focus on making sense of content within an individual production video by extracting salient metadata and localising objects.    we present a scalable semantic video concept detection framework, applied to automated metadata annotation (video logging) in a broadcast production environment. video logging demands both accurate and fast concept detection. whilst research often focuses on the former, the latter is essential in practical scenarios where days of footage may be shot per broadcast episode and production is dependent on immediate availability of metadata. we present a hierarchical classification framework that delivers benefits to both through two contributions. first, a dynamic weighting scheme for combining video features from multiple modalities enabling higher accuracy detection rates over diverse production footage. second, a hierarchical classification strategy that exploits ontological relationships between concepts to scale sub-linearly with the number of classes, yielding a real-time solution. we demonstrate an end-to-end production system using a cloud-based architecture with our detection framework.    we also describe a novel fully automatic algorithm for identifying salient objects in video based on their motion. spatially coherent clusters of optical flow vectors are sampled to generate estimates of affine motion parameters local to super-pixels identified within each frame. these estimates, combined with spatial data, form coherent point distributions in a 5d solution space corresponding to objects or parts there-of. these distributions are temporally de-noised using a particle filtering approach, and clustered to estimate the position and motion parameters of salient moving objects in the clip. we demonstrate localization of salient object/s in a variety of clips exhibiting moving and cluttered backgrounds. images are re-mapped as scale-space trees. the minimal data structure is then augmented by “complement nodes” to increase the practical value of the representation. it is then shown how the resulting ctree can be used to remove noise from images, provide a hierarchical way to estimate a dense disparity map from a stereo pair and to provide a basic segmentation of images for image retrieval purposes.
purpose the purpose of this study was to develop a framework for analyzing retinal pigment epithelium (rpe) expression profiles from zebrafish eye mutants. methods the fish model we used was swi/snf-related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a, member 4 (smarca4), a retinal dystrophic mutant with a previously described retinal phenotype and expression profiles. histological and affymetrix genechip analyses were conducted to characterize the rpe defects and underlying differential expression, respectively. results histological analysis revealed that smarca4 rpe was formed, but its differentiation was abnormal. in particular, ultrastructural analysis of smarca4 rpe by transmission electron microscopy demonstrated several defects in melanogenesis. the nature of these defects also suggests that the cytoskeletal dynamics, which are tightly linked with melanogenesis, were impaired in smarca4 rpe. to compare the expression profile of normal wild-type (wt) and smarca4 rpe, the gene expression profiles of microdissected retinas and rpe-attached retinas were measured with affymetrix genechip analysis. the rpe expression values were then estimated from these samples by subtracting the retinal expression values from the expression values of the rpe-attached retinas. a factorial analysis was conducted using the expression values of the rpe, retinal, and whole-embryo samples. specific rules (contrasts) were built using the coefficients of the resulting fitted models to select for three groups of genes: 1) smarca4-regulated rpe genes, 2) smarca4-regulated retinal genes, and 3) smarca4-regulated rpe genes that are not differentially expressed in the retina. interestingly, the third group consists of 39 genes that are highly related to cytoskeletal dynamics, melanogenesis, and paracrine and intracellular signal transduction. conclusions our analytical framework provides an experimental approach to identify differentially-regulated genes in the retina and the rpe of zebrafish mutants in which both of these tissues are affected by the underlying mutation. specifically, we have used the method to identify a group of 39 genes that can potentially explain the melanogenesis defect in the smarca4 rpe. in addition, several genes in this group are secreted signaling molecules. thus, this observation further implicates that the smarca4 rpe might play a role in the retinal dystrophic phenotype in smarca4. zebrafish with the young (yng) mutation show a defect in retinal cell differentiation. here we demonstrate that a mutation in a brahma-related gene (brg1) is responsible for the yng phenotype. brahma homologues function as essential subunits for swi/snf-type chromatin remodeling complexes. our analysis indicates that brg1 is required for the wave of mitogen-activated protein kinase activity that precedes retinal cell differentiation. using specific inhibitors of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway we show this signal has a direct role in retinal cell differentiation. lastly, through investigations of mutants in other chromatin remodeling subunits, we provide genetic evidence for gene and tissue specificity of the brahma chromatin remodeling complex.
identifying the factors that influence student academic performance is essential to provide timely and effective support interventions. the data collected during enrolment and after commencement into a course provide an important source of information to assist with identifying potential risk indicators associated with poor academic performance and attrition. both predictive and descriptive data mining techniques have been applied on educational data to discover the significant reasons behind student performance. these techniques have their own advantages and limitations. for example, predictive techniques tend to maximise accuracy for correctly classifying students, while the descriptive techniques simply search for interesting student features without considering their academic outcome. subgroup discovery is a data mining method which takes the advantages of both predictive and descriptive approaches. this study uses subgroup discovery to extract significant factors of student performance for a certain outcome (pass or fail). in this work, we have utilised student demographic and academic data recorded at enrolment, as well as course assessment and participation data retrieved from the institution’s learning management system (moodle) to detect the factors affecting student performance. the results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the subgroup discovery method in general in identifying the factors, and the pros and cons of some popular subgroup discovery algorithms used in this research. from the experiments, it has been found that students, who have indigent socio-economic background or been admitted based on special entry requirement, are most likely to fail. the experiments on moodle data have revealed that students having lower level of access to the course resources and forum have higher possibility of being unsuccessful. from the combined data, we have identified some interesting subgroups which are not detected using enrolment or moodle data separately. it has been found that those students, who study off-campus or part-time and have a low level of contributions to the course learning activities, are more likely to be the low-performing students. this paper presents an overview on the vikamine system for subgroup discovery, pattern mining and analytics. as of vikamine version 2, it is implemented as rich-client platform (rcp) application, based on the eclipse framework. this provides for a highly-configurable environment, and allows modular extensions using plugins. we present the system, briefly discuss exemplary plugins, and provide a sketch of successful applications.
abstract individual differences in adjustment during a disease’s course determine psychological response and outcome. this study aimed to investigate prospectively whether coping with health stressors and self-sacrificing defense style could predict psychological adjustment and health-related quality of life (hrqol) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra). seventy-four consecutive ra patients attending a rheumatology clinic were assessed for psychological distress (scl-90-r), sense of coherence (soc scale), self-sacrificing defense style (defense style questionnaire-88), disease activity (das-28), pain, disability (health assessment questionnaire) and hrqol (world health organization quality of life instrument, short form) at baseline and 5 years later. multiple regression and moderator analyses were carried out. the results showed that disease activity (p < .001), pain (p = .005), psychological distress (p = .031), social relations hrqol (p = .042) and environment hrqol (p = .020) significantly improved over time. soc was found an independent predictor of improvement in psychological distress (p = .003), overall general health (p = .002) and social relations hrqol (p = .004); self-sacrificing independently predicted environment hrqol (p = .042). the self-sacrificing defense style moderated the relationships between improvement in pain and improvement in overall general health (p = .024) and between improvement in pain and improvement in social relations hrqol (p = .006). these findings indicate that, in ra, soc predicts improvement in psychological distress and hrqol over time, while a self-sacrificing defense style moderates the relationship of pain with hrqol in the long term. these variables may partly explain inter-individual differences in adaptation to ra. therefore, the design of psychotherapeutic trials targeting the patients’ defensive profiles and coping with health stressors capacities is an important research perspective. background the defense style questionnaire (dsq) was designed to assess behavior indicative of conscious derivatives of defensive styles. this study aimed to assess the factor structure and the main psychometric properties of its greek version in 3 different samples.   methods the dsq-88 was translated into greek using back-translation, and it was administered to 2308 participants (984 healthy subjects, 1084 medical patients, and 240 psychiatric patients). exploratory factor analyses were performed; symptom distress checklist-90-r and minnesota multiphasic personality inventory (mmpi) ego strength scales were administered for testing criterion and concurrent validity, followed by hierarchical multiple regression analysis.   results four factors were identified, largely corresponding to the original version's maladaptive, image-distorting, self-sacrificing, and adaptive styles, showing a remarkable stability in all 3 samples. adaptive style was positively correlated to ego strength, whereas maladaptive, image-distorting, and self-sacrificing styles were negatively correlated, in descending order. this, along with the intercorrelations observed between the 4 styles, provides evidence that this version supports the hierarchical organization of defensive functioning. test-retest reliabilities were adequate for all styles (r(1i)'s = 0.88, 0.81, 0.77, and 0.81, respectively). internal consistencies were satisfactory for maladaptive style (0.82), sufficient for self-sacrificing (0.76), and rather low for image-distorting (0.68) and adaptive (0.66) styles. maladaptive, image-distorting, and self-sacrificing-but not adaptive-styles could differentiate nonpatients from psychiatric patients. maladaptive style was positively and adaptive style was negatively independently associated with psychological distress.   conclusions the present findings support the applicability of the greek version of dsq-88 within the greek population. future studies could improve its psychometric properties by finding new items for image-distorting and, especially, adaptive styles.
background intermittent preventive treatment (ipt) is a promising malaria control strategy; however, the optimal regimen remains unclear. we conducted a randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a single course of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp), amodiaquine + sp (aq+sp) or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (dp) among schoolchildren to inform ipt. methods asymptomatic girls aged 8 to 12 years and boys aged 8 to 14 years enrolled in two primary schools in tororo, uganda were randomized to receive one of the study regimens or placebo, regardless of presence of parasitemia at enrollment, and followed for 42 days. the primary outcome was risk of parasitemia at 42 days. survival analysis was used to assess differences between regimens. results of 780 enrolled participants, 769 (98.6%) completed follow-up and were assigned a treatment outcome. the risk of parasitemia at 42 days varied significantly between dp (11.7% [95% confidence interval (ci): 7.9, 17.1]), aq+sp (44.3% [37.6, 51.5]), and sp (79.7% [95% ci: 73.6, 85.2], p<0.001). the risk of parasitemia in sp-treated children was no different than in those receiving placebo (84.6% [95% ci: 79.1, 89.3], p = 0.22). no serious adverse events occurred, but aq+sp was associated with increased risk of vomiting compared to placebo (13.0% [95% ci: 9.1, 18.5] vs. 4.7% [95% ci: 2.5, 8.8], respectively, p = 0.003). conclusions dp was the most efficacious and well-tolerated regimen tested, although aq+sp appears to be a suitable alternative for ipt in schoolchildren. use of sp for ipt may not be appropriate in areas with high-level sp resistance in africa. trial registration clinicaltrials.gov nct00852371 abstract key parasite polymorphisms were assessed in subjects treated for malaria with artesunate-amodiaquine in tororo, uganda. for pfcrt, all of the isolates tested had the cviet haplotype. for pfmdr1, 86y and 1246y were common at baseline and their prevalences were significantly higher in new isolates after therapy, indicating that treatment selected for mutations associated with a decreased response to amodiaquine.
spread spectrum watermarking security can be evaluated via mutual information. in this paper, we present a new method to reduce mutual information by embedding watermark in the key controlled wavelet domain. theoretical analysis shows that the watermark signals are diffused and its energy is weakened when they are evaluated from the attacker’s observation domain, and it can lead to higher document-to-watermark energy ratio and better watermark security without losing robustness. practical algorithms of security tests using optimal estimators are also applied and the performance of the estimators in the observation domain is studied. besides, we also present a novel method of calculating the key controlled wavelet filter, and give both numerical and analytical implementations. experiment results show that this method provides more valid parameters than existing methods. many illegal copies of digital video productions for cinema release can be found on the internet before their official release. during the illegal copying of cinema footage, composite geometric distortions commonly occur due to the angle of the camcorder relative to the screen. we propose a novel video watermarking based on spread spectrum way that satisfies the requirements for protecting digital cinema. it enables the detector to not only extract the embedded message but also estimate the position where the camcorder recording is made. it is sure that the proposed position estimating model (pem) can judge the seat in a theater with a mean absolute error (mae) of (33.84, 9.53, 50.38) cm. experimental results using various types of films show that the presented method provides the mathematical model for detecting and investigating the position of the pirate.
the objective of this study was to investigate the association of parent acculturation with child fruit and vegetable consumption and obesity, as measured by body mass index (bmi). participants included 250 mexican-american and other hispanic families living within san diego county. height and weight measurements were collected to calculate the age- and sex-specific bmi for each child and parent, and parents completed self-administered surveys. child bmi z-score was significantly related to parent bmi after controlling for parent acculturation and parent birth place (β = 0.05, p < 0.01). child fruit consumption was significantly associated with parent acculturation (β = −0.02, p = 0.01) and parent bmi (β = 0.02, p = 0.04) after adjusting for the other variables in the model. child vegetable consumption was not significantly related to parent acculturation. findings suggest that parental weight status may be more predictive of child obesity than acculturation, and highlight the need to examine culturally relevant behavioral and psychosocial factors related to childhood obesity and dietary behaviors. background few studies have examined the influence of country of birth and acculturation status on indicators of obesity using national samples of mexican-american women and men.   methods we analysed data for 1387 mexican-american women and 1404 mexican- american men, ages 25-64, from the third national health and nutrition examination survey (1988-1994). we examined whether waist circumference and abdominal obesity varied by country of birth and acculturation status (primary language spoken), and whether among those with abdominal obesity, number of associated cardiovascular disease (cvd) risk factors varied by country of birth and acculturation status.   results both country of birth and, to a lesser degree, acculturation status were significantly associated with waist circumference and abdominal obesity. mexican-born women and men had the smallest waist circumference (90.4 cm, 94.0 cm respectively), us-born english-speaking women and men had intermediate waist circumference (93.6 cm, 97.3 cm), and us-born spanish-speaking women and men had the largest waist circumference (96.9 cm, 97.7 cm), after accounting for age, education, per cent of energy from dietary fat, leisure-time physical activity, and smoking. all women had high prevalences of abdominal obesity, particularly us-born spanish-speaking women (68.7%). in addition, us-born spanish-speaking women with abdominal obesity were significantly more likely than their counterparts to have one or more of the following cvd risk factors: high serum insulin, non-insulin dependent diabetes, high blood lipids, and/or hypertension.   conclusions these findings illustrate the heterogeneity of the mexican-american population and suggest that country of birth and lack of acculturation to the majority culture, as well as secondary lifestyle changes, may explain the significant clinical differences observed in abdominal obesity within mexican-american population subgroups.
•  the retrotrapezoid nucleus (rtn) is an important site of chemoreception, i.e. the mechanism by which the brain regulates breathing in response to changes in tissue co2/h+. •  mechanisms underlying rtn chemoreception appear to involve direct co2/h+‐mediated neuronal activation and indirect neuronal activation by co2‐evoked atp release (i.e. purinergic signalling) from astrocytes. •  here, we show in vitro and in vivo that purinergic signalling in the rtn contributes to ∼30% of rtn chemoreception. •  purinergic drive in the rtn involves gap junction hemichannels but not p2y1 receptors. •  these results clearly indicate that purinergic signalling contributes to integrated output of the rtn during hypercapnia and thus is an important determinant of respiratory drive. a long-standing theory posits that central chemoreception, the cns mechanism for co2 detection and regulation of breathing, involves neurons located at the ventral surface of the medulla oblongata (vms). using in vivo and in vitro electrophysiological recordings, we identify vms neurons within the rat retrotrapezoid nucleus (rtn) that have characteristics befitting these elusive chemoreceptors. these glutamatergic neurons are vigorously activated by co2 in vivo, whereas serotonergic neurons are not. their co2 sensitivity is unaffected by pharmacological blockade of the respiratory pattern generator and persists without carotid body input. rtn co2-sensitive neurons have extensive dendrites along the vms and they innervate key pontomedullary respiratory centers. in brainstem slices, a subset of rtn neurons with markedly similar morphology is robustly activated by acidification and co2. their ph sensitivity is intrinsic and involves a background k+ current. in short, the co2-sensitive neurons of the rtn are good candidates for the long sought-after vms chemoreceptors.
heme oxygenase‐1 (ho‐1) is induced under a variety of pro‐oxidant conditions such as those associated with ischemia‐reperfusion injury (iri) of transplanted organs. ho‐1 cleaves the heme porphyrin ring releasing fe2+, which induces the expression of the fe2+ sequestering protein ferritin. by limiting the ability of fe2+ to participate in the generation of free radicals through the fenton reaction, ferritin acts as an anti‐oxidant. we have previously shown that ho‐1 protects transplanted organs from iri. we have linked this protective effect with the anti‐apoptotic action of ho‐1. whether the iron‐binding properties of ferritin contributed to the protective effect of ho‐1 was not clear. we now report that recombinant adenovirus mediated overexpression of the ferritin heavy chain (h‐ferritin) gene protects rat livers from iri and prevents hepatocellular damage upon transplantation into syngeneic recipients. the protective effect of h‐ferritin is associated with the inhibition of endothelial cell and hepatocyte apoptosis in vivo. h‐ferritin protects cultured endothelial cells from apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli. these findings unveil the anti‐apoptotic function of h‐ferritin and suggest that h‐ferritin can be used in a therapeutic manner to prevent liver iri and thus maximize the organ donor pool used for transplantation. heme oxygenase 1 (ho-1) inhibits apoptosis by regulating cellular prooxidant iron. we now show that there is an additional mechanism by which ho-1 inhibits apoptosis, namely by generating the gaseous molecule carbon monoxide (co). overexpression of ho-1, or induction of ho-1 expression by heme, protects endothelial cells (ecs) from apoptosis. when ho-1 enzymatic activity is blocked by tin protoporphyrin (snppix) or the action of co is inhibited by hemoglobin (hb), ho-1 no longer prevents ec apoptosis while these reagents do not affect the antiapoptotic action of bcl-2. exposure of ecs to exogenous co, under inhibition of ho-1 activity by snppix, substitutes ho-1 in preventing ec apoptosis. the mechanism of action of ho-1/co is dependent on the activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) signaling transduction pathway. expression of ho-1 or exposure of ecs to exogenous co enhanced p38 mapk activation by tnf-α. specific inhibition of p38 mapk activation by the pyridinyl imidazol sb203580 or through overexpression of a p38 mapk dominant negative mutant abrogated the antiapoptotic effect of ho-1. taken together, these data demonstrate that the antiapoptotic effect of ho-1 in ecs is mediated by co and more specifically via the activation of p38 mapk by co.
objectiveto estimate the accuracy of pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (mri) in the diagnosis of deeply infiltrating endometriosis (die).methodsa comprehensive search of the medline, pubmed, lilacs, scopus, embase, cochrane central register of controlled trials (central), biomed central, and isi web of science databases was conducted from january 1990 to december 2013. the medical subject headings (meshs) and text words “deep endometriosis”, “deeply infiltrating endometriosis”, “die”, “magnetic resonance”, and “mri” were searched. studies that compared the parameters of pelvic mris with those of paraffin-embedded sections for the diagnosis of die were included.resultstwenty studies were analyzed, which included 1,819 women. pooled sensitivity and specificity were calculated across eight subgroups: for all sites, these were 0.83 and 0.90, respectively; for the bladder, 0.64 and 0.98, respectively; for the intestine, 0.84 and 0.97, respectively; for the pouch of douglas, 0.89 and 0.94, respectively; for the rectosigmoid, 0.83 and 0.88, respectively; for the rectovaginal, 0.77 and 0.95, respectively; for the uterosacral ligaments, 0.85 and 0.80, respectively; and for the vagina and the posterior vaginal fornix, 0.82 and 0.82, respectively.conclusionin summary, pelvic mri is a useful preoperative test for predicting the diagnosis of multiple sites of deep infiltrating endometriosis. backgroundthere is a lack of consensus regarding the use of quality scores in diagnostic systematic reviews. the objective of this study was to use different methods of weighting items included in a quality assessment tool for diagnostic accuracy studies (quadas) to produce an overall quality score, and to examine the effects of incorporating these into a systematic review.methodswe developed five schemes for weighting quadas to produce quality scores. we used three methods to investigate the effects of quality scores on test performance. we used a set of 28 studies that assessed the accuracy of ultrasound for the diagnosis of vesico-ureteral reflux in children.resultsthe different methods of weighting individual items from the same quality assessment tool produced different quality scores. the different scoring schemes ranked different studies in different orders; this was especially evident for the intermediate quality studies. comparing the results of studies stratified as "high" and "low" quality based on quality scores resulted in different conclusions regarding the effects of quality on estimates of diagnostic accuracy depending on the method used to produce the quality score. a similar effect was observed when quality scores were included in meta-regression analysis as continuous variables, although the differences were less apparent.conclusionquality scores should not be incorporated into diagnostic systematic reviews. incorporation of the results of the quality assessment into the systematic review should involve investigation of the association of individual quality items with estimates of diagnostic accuracy, rather than using a combined quality score.
increasing evidence suggests that a history of diabetes mellitus (dm) may be associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (crc). to provide a quantitative assessment of the association between dm and risk of crc, we evaluated the relation between dm and incidence and mortality of crc in a systematic review of cohort studies. full publications of cohort studies were identified in medline, embase and science citation index expanded, through february 28, 2011. summary relative risks (srrs) with 95% confidence intervals (cis) were summarized using a random-effects model. between-study heterogeneity was assessed using the cochran’s q and i2 statistics. a total of 41 cohort studies (35 articles) were included in this systematic review. combining 30 cohort studies which presented results on diabetes and crc incidence, diabetes was associated with an increased incidence of crc (srrs 1.27, 95% ci: 1.21–1.34), with evident heterogeneity among studies (p = 0.002, i2 = 48.4%). subgroup analysis and meta-regression analysis by controlling the confounders showed that the increased incidence of crc was independent of geographic locations, sex, family history of colorectal cancer, smoking, physical activity and body mass index. diabetes was also positively associated with crc mortality (srr 1.20, 95% ci: 1.03–1.40), with evidence of heterogeneity between studies (p < 0.001, i2 = 81.4%). results from this systematic review support that compared to non-diabetic individuals, diabetic individuals have an increased risk of crc. abstract objective: funnel plots (plots of effect estimates against sample size) may be useful to detect bias in meta-analyses that were later contradicted by large trials. we examined whether a simple test of asymmetry of funnel plots predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared to large trials, and we assessed the prevalence of bias in published meta-analyses. design: medline search to identify pairs consisting of a meta-analysis and a single large trial (concordance of results was assumed if effects were in the same direction and the meta-analytic estimate was within 30% of the trial); analysis of funnel plots from 37 meta-analyses identified from a hand search of four leading general medicine journals 1993-6 and 38 meta-analyses from the second 1996 issue of the cochrane database of systematic reviews. main outcome measure: degree of funnel plot asymmetry as measured by the intercept from regression of standard normal deviates against precision. results: in the eight pairs of meta-analysis and large trial that were identified (five from cardiovascular medicine, one from diabetic medicine, one from geriatric medicine, one from perinatal medicine) there were four concordant and four discordant pairs. in all cases discordance was due to meta-analyses showing larger effects. funnel plot asymmetry was present in three out of four discordant pairs but in none of concordant pairs. in 14 (38%) journal meta-analyses and 5 (13%) cochrane reviews, funnel plot asymmetry indicated that there was bias. conclusions: a simple analysis of funnel plots provides a useful test for the likely presence of bias in meta-analyses, but as the capacity to detect bias will be limited when meta-analyses are based on a limited number of small trials the results from such analyses should be treated with considerable caution. key messages systematic reviews of randomised trials are the best strategy for appraising evidence; however, the findings of some meta-analyses were later contradicted by large trials funnel plots, plots of the trials' effect estimates against sample size, are skewed and asymmetrical in the presence of publication bias and other biases funnel plot asymmetry, measured by regression analysis, predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared with single large trials funnel plot asymmetry was found in 38% of meta-analyses published in leading general medicine journals and in 13% of reviews from the cochrane database of systematic reviews critical examination of systematic reviews for publication and related biases should be considered a routine procedure
background: trochlear dysplasia is one of the most important risk factors for recurrent patellar instability. it is defined on true lateral conventional radiographs (cr) and axial magnetic resonance imaging (mri). the type of trochlear dysplasia is decisive for surgical treatment; however, low agreement between cr and mri has been reported. purpose: to compare the dejour classification of trochlear dysplasia on cr and axial mri using differing levels defined in the literature. study design: cohort study (diagnosis); level of evidence, 2. methods: the 4-type classification of trochlear dysplasia by dejour was used to analyze 228 knees with recurrent patellar dislocations on true lateral cr and axial mri. the 2-type modification of the dejour classification was also similarly analyzed. measurements on axial mri were performed at 3 different levels: mr1, the most proximal level where the intercondylar notch forms a “roman arch”; mr2, 3 cm above the joint line; and mr3, the midpatellar height. results: mr1 was measured at a mean distance of 29 ± 3.5 mm and mr3 at a mean of 38 ± 5.8 mm above the joint line. mr1 and mr2 were always measured on the cartilaginous trochlea, whereas 52% of mr3 was found more proximally. overall agreement was fair between cr and mr1/mr2 (31.1%/25.4%, respectively) and highest for mr3 (45.2%; p < .01). the highest agreement (81.8%) was found for mr3 with the 2-type trochlear dysplasia classification (low-grade trochlear dysplasia: type a vs high-grade trochlear dysplasia: types b, c, and d) and lower for mr1 (67.5%) and mr2 (62.0%). conclusion: trochlear dysplasia measured on cr and mri shows only fair agreement, especially when the supratrochlear region of the distal femur is not analyzed on axial mri. mri analysis that considers the cartilaginous trochlea only tends to underestimate the severity of dysplasia according to dejour. for a more precise evaluation of trochlear dysplasia, the entire distal femur should be analyzed on axial mri. purpose to establish quantitative and qualitative magnetic resonance (mr) criteria for the diagnosis of trochlear dysplasia.   materials and methods mr images were analyzed in 16 consecutive patients with and 23 without trochlear dysplasia. the standard of reference was a true lateral radiograph of the knee. quantitative and qualitative mr criteria were assessed.   results in patients with trochlear dysplasia, the trochlear groove was significantly less deep than that in control subjects. the most accurate measurement was 3 cm above the femorotibial joint space (p: <.001), where a trochlear depth of 3 mm or less had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 96%. the ventral trochlear prominence between the supratrochlear femoral cortex and the most ventral point of the trochlear floor (midsagittal section) was always larger than 6.9 mm in dysplastic trochleae. a facet ratio of less than 2:5 (medial to lateral) 3 cm above joint space level had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 96%. a nipplelike anterior prominence at the superior end of the femoral trochlea on midsagittal images was a specific (91%) qualitative criterion.   conclusion dysplasia of the femoral trochlea can be diagnosed reliably by using quantitative or qualitative criteria on midsagittal or transverse mr images obtained 3 cm above the femorotibial joint space.
physical inactivity is the fourth leading risk factor for global mortality, with most of these deaths occurring in low and middle-income countries (lmics) like india. research from developed countries has consistently demonstrated associations between built environment features and physical activity levels of populations. the development of culturally sensitive and reliable measures of the built environment is a necessary first step for accurate analysis of environmental correlates of physical activity in lmics. this study systematically adapted the neighborhood environment walkability scale (news) for india and evaluated aspects of test-retest reliability of the adapted version among indian adults. cultural adaptation of the news was conducted by indian and international experts. semi-structured interviews were conducted with local residents and key informants in the city of chennai, india. at baseline, participants (n = 370; female = 47.2%) from chennai completed the adapted news-india surveys on perceived residential density, land use mix-diversity, land use mix-access, street connectivity, infrastructure and safety for walking and cycling, aesthetics, traffic safety, and safety from crime. news-india was administered for a second time to consenting participants (n = 62; female = 53.2%) with a gap of 2–3 weeks between successive administrations. qualitative findings demonstrated that built environment barriers and constraints to active commuting and physical activity behaviors intersected with social ecological systems. the adapted news subscales had moderate to high test-retest reliability (icc range 0.48–0.99). the news-india demonstrated acceptable measurement properties among indian adults and may be a useful tool for evaluation of built environment attributes in india. further adaptation and evaluation in rural and suburban settings in india is essential to create a version that could be used throughout india. backgroundthe ipen (international physical activity and environment network) adult project seeks to conduct pooled analyses of associations of perceived neighborhood environment, as measured by the neighborhood environment walkability scale (news) and its abbreviated version (news-a), with physical activity using data from 12 countries. as ipen countries used adapted versions of the news/news-a, this paper aimed to develop scoring protocols that maximize cross-country comparability in responses. this information is also highly relevant to non-ipen studies employing the news/news-a, which is one of the most popular measures of perceived environment globally.methodsthe following countries participated in the ipen adult study: australia, belgium, brazil, colombia, czech republic, denmark, hong kong, mexico, new zealand, spain, the united kingdom, and the united states. participants (n = 14,305) were recruited from neighborhoods varying in walkability and socio-economic status. countries collected data on the perceived environment using a self- or interviewer-administered version of the news/news-a. confirmatory factor analysis (cfa) was used to derive comparable country-specific measurement models of the news/news-a. the level of correspondence between standard and alternative versions of the news/news-a factor-analyzable subscales was determined by estimating the correlations and mean standardized difference (cohen’s d) between them using data from countries that had included items from both standard and alternative versions of the subscales.resultsfinal country-specific measurement models of the news/news-a provided acceptable levels of fit to the data and shared the same factorial structure with six latent factors and two single items. the correspondence between the standard and alternative versions of subscales of land use mix – access, infrastructure and safety for walking/cycling, and aesthetics was high. the brazilian version of the traffic safety subscale was highly, while the australian and belgian versions were marginally, comparable to the standard version. single-item versions of the street connectivity subscale used in australia and belgium showed marginally acceptable correspondence to the standard version.conclusionswe have proposed country-specific modifications to the original scoring protocol of the news/news-a that enhance inter-country comparability. these modifications have yielded sufficiently equivalent measurement models of the news/news-a. some inter-country discrepancies remain. these need to be considered when interpreting findings from different countries.
rapid, accurate, and quantitative characterization of immune status of patients is of utmost importance for disease diagnosis and prognosis, evaluating efficacy of immunotherapeutics and tailoring drug treatments. immune status of patients is often dynamic and patient-specific, and such complex heterogeneity has made accurate, real-time measurements of patient immune status challenging in the clinical setting. recent advances in microfluidics have demonstrated promising applications of the technology for immune monitoring with minimum sample requirements and rapid functional immunophenotyping capability. this review will highlight recent developments of microfluidic platforms that can perform rapid and accurate cellular functional assays on patient immune cells. we will also discuss the future potential of integrated microfluidics to perform rapid, accurate, and sensitive cellular functional assays at a single-cell resolution on different types or subpopulations of immune cells, to provide an unprecedented level of information depth on the distribution of immune cell functionalities. we envision that such microfluidic immunophenotyping tools will allow for comprehensive and systems-level immunomonitoring, unlocking the potential to transform experimental clinical immunology into an information-rich science. an accurate measurement of the immune status in patients with immune system disorders is critical in evaluating the stage of diseases and tailoring drug treatments. the functional cellular immunity test is a promising method to establish the diagnosis of immune dysfunctions. the conventional functional cellular immunity test involves measurements of the capacity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines when stimulated ex vivo. however, this "bulk" assay measures the overall reactivity of a population of lymphocytes and monocytes, making it difficult to pinpoint the phenotype or real identity of the reactive immune cells involved. in this research, we develop a large surface micromachined poly-dimethylsiloxane (pdms) microfiltration membrane (pmm) with high porosity, which is integrated in a microfluidic microfiltration platform. using the pmm with functionalized microbeads conjugated with antibodies against specific cell surface proteins, we demonstrated rapid, efficient and high-throughput on-chip isolation, enrichment, and stimulation of subpopulations of immune cells from blood specimens. furthermore, the pmm-integrated microfiltration platform, coupled with a no-wash homogeneous chemiluminescence assay ("alphalisa"), enables us to demonstrate rapid and sensitive on-chip immunophenotyping assays for subpopulations of immune cells isolated directly from minute quantities of blood samples.
for decades, policies regarding generic medicines have sought to provide patients with economical access to safe and effective drugs, while encouraging the development of new therapies. this balance is becoming more challenging for physicians and regulators as biologics and non-biological complex drugs (nbcds) such as glatiramer acetate demonstrate remarkable efficacy, because generics for these medicines are more difficult to assess. we sought to develop computational methods that use transcriptional profiles to compare branded medicines to generics, robustly characterizing differences in biological impact. we combined multiple computational methods to determine whether differentially expressed genes result from random variation, or point to consistent differences in biological impact of the generic compared to the branded medicine. we applied these methods to analyze gene expression data from mouse splenocytes exposed to either branded glatiramer acetate or a generic. the computational methods identified extensive evidence that branded glatiramer acetate has a more consistent biological impact across batches than the generic, and has a distinct impact on regulatory t cells and myeloid lineage cells. in summary, we developed a computational pipeline that integrates multiple methods to compare two medicines in an innovative way. this pipeline, and the specific findings distinguishing branded glatiramer acetate from a generic, can help physicians and regulators take appropriate steps to ensure safety and efficacy. feature selection techniques have become an apparent need in many bioinformatics applications. in addition to the large pool of techniques that have already been developed in the machine learning and data mining fields, specific applications in bioinformatics have led to a wealth of newly proposed techniques. in this article, we make the interested reader aware of the possibilities of feature selection, providing a basic taxonomy of feature selection techniques, and discussing their use, variety and potential in a number of both common as well as upcoming bioinformatics applications.
we aimed to investigate the prevalence of impaired fasting glucose (ifg) and impaired glucose tolerance (igt), and their associations with cardiometabolic risk factors, according to ethnicity in a large obese paediatric cohort. a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test was performed in 1,007 overweight/obese dutch children of multi-ethnic origin, referred to the obesity outpatient clinics of two dutch hospitals in amsterdam (mean age, 11.4 ± 3.2 years; 50.7% boys). anthropometric parameters and blood samples were collected, and cardiometabolic risk factors were assessed. the cohort consisted of dutch native (26.0%), turkish (23.7%), moroccan (18.8%) and children of ‘other’ (31.5%) ethnicity. the prevalence of ifg was significantly higher in moroccan and turkish children as compared to dutch native children (25.4% and 19.7% vs. 11.8%, respectively, p < 0.05). igt was most frequently present in turkish and dutch native children, relative to moroccan children (6.3% and 5.3% vs. 1.6%, p < 0.05). besides pubertal status and ethnicity, components of ‘metabolic syndrome’ (mets) which were associated with igt, independent of hyperinsulinaemia, were hypertension [odds ratio (or), 2.3; 95% ci, 1.1–4.9] while a trend was seen for high triglycerides (or, 2.0; 95% ci, 0.9–4.3). when analyzing components of mets which were associated with ifg, only low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was significantly associated (or, 1.7; 95% ci, 1.2–2.5) independent of hyperinsulinaemia. in conclusion, in a dutch multi-ethnic cohort of overweight/obese children, a high prevalence of ifg was found against a low prevalence of igt, which differed in their associations with cardiometabolic risk factors. to evaluate how non-high-density-lipoprotein (non-hdl) is associated with impaired fasting glucose (ifg) and clustered metabolic risk (mr) factors among adolescents, we pooled 2764 adolescents, aged 12-19 years, from the national health and nutrition examination survey from 3 time periods (1999-2000, 2001-2002, and 2003-2004) who were free of diabetes and had fasted overnight for this analysis. ifg was defined as 100 <or= glucose <or= 125 mg.dl-1. age- and sex-specific cut-offs were used for 4 mr factors: higher levels of triglycerides, waist circumference, blood pressure, and lower levels of hdl. clustered mr was defined as having any 2 of the 4 factors. overall, approximately 11% of adolescents had ifg. the mean level of non-hdl cholesterol was much higher in those with ifg than in those without ifg, with adjustment for certain confounding variables (121.4 vs. 110.1 mg.dl-1; p < 0.05). this difference could still be observed in adolescents with one or more clustered mr factors. however, there were no statistical differences in low-density-lipoprotein (ldl) level. compared with those who were without ifg and not at high levels of non-hdl - after adjustment for age, sex, race, current smoking, and body mass index - the odds of having clustered mr factors were 1.08 (95% ci, 0.65-1.82) for those with ifg and low non-hdl cholesterol, 3.55 (2.29-5.48) for those without ifg but with high non-hdl cholesterol, and 10.10 (3.67-27.80) for those with both ifg and high non-hdl cholesterol. moreover, those with ifg and at increased risk of obesity were more likely to have higher levels of non-hdl cholesterol (odds ratio (95% ci): 4.41 (2.28-8.50)), compared with those without ifg and not at increased risk of obesity. in summary, prediabetic adolescents with ifg and high levels of non-hdl cholesterol are more likely to have clustered mr factors. thus, the levels of non-hdl cholesterol may be an important indicator in monitoring cardiovascular disease risk among adolescents with ifg.
abstract land monitoring is performed increasingly using high and medium resolution optical satellites, such as the sentinel-2. however, optical data is inevitably subjected to the variable operational conditions under which it was acquired. overlapping of features caused by shadows, soft transitions between shadowed and non-shadowed regions, and temporal variability of the observed land-cover types require radiometric corrections. this study examines a new approach to enhancing the accuracy of land cover identification that resolves this problem. the proposed method constructs an ensemble-type classification model with weak classifiers tuned to the particular operational conditions under which the data was acquired. iterative segmentation over the learning set is applied for this purpose, where feature space is partitioned according to the likelihood of misclassifications introduced by the classification model. as these are a consequence of overlapping features, such partitioning avoids the need for radiometric corrections of the data, and divides land cover types implicitly into subclasses. as a result, improved performance of all tested classification approaches were measured during the validation that was conducted on sentinel-2 data. the highest accuracies in terms of f1-scores were achieved using the naive bayes classifier as the weak classifier, while supplementing original spectral signatures with normalised difference vegetation index and texture analysis features, namely, average intensity, contrast, homogeneity, and dissimilarity. in total, an f1−score of nearly 95% was achieved in this way, with f1-scores of each particular land cover type reaching above 90%. boosting is one of the most important recent developments in classification methodology. boosting works by sequentially applying a classification algorithm to reweighted versions of the training data and then taking a weighted majority vote of the sequence of classifiers thus produced. for many classification algorithms, this simple strategy results in dramatic improvements in performance. we show that this seemingly mysterious phenomenon can be understood in terms of well-known statistical principles, namely additive modeling and maximum likelihood. for the two-class problem, boosting can be viewed as an approximation to additive modeling on the logistic scale using maximum bernoulli likelihood as a criterion. we develop more direct approximations and show that they exhibit nearly identical results to boosting. direct multiclass generalizations based on multinomial likelihood are derived that exhibit performance comparable to other recently proposed multiclass generalizations of boosting in most situations, and far superior in some. we suggest a minor modification to boosting that can reduce computation, often by factors of 10 to 50. finally, we apply these insights to produce an alternative formulation of boosting decision trees. this approach, based on best-first truncated tree induction, often leads to better performance, and can provide interpretable descriptions of the aggregate decision rule. it is also much faster computationally, making it more suitable to large-scale data mining applications.
arabinogalactan proteins (agps) are important proteoglycans regulating somatic embryogenesis in diverse plant species. embryogenic cells of somatic embryos are covered by special extracellular cell wall layer called extracellular surface matrix network (ecmsn) at their early developmental stages. here we show that highly embryogenic cell line ac78 of hybrid fir (abies alba × abies cephalonica) differs from very low-embryogenic cell line ac77 in the abundance, subcellular localization and deposition of subset of secreted agps. a specific agp epitope containing gal residues and reacting to gal4 antibody is secreted and deposited into ecmsn, which covers the surface of the embryogenic cells showing high embryogenic and regeneration capacity in the cell line ac78. on the other hand, this gal4 agp epitope was not secreted and/or found on the surface of meristematic cells showing low embryogenic and regeneration capacity in the cell line ac77, as well as on the surface of non-embryogenic suspensor cells and callus cells in both cell lines ac77 and ac78. as a positive control, we have used another agp epitope lm2 (containing glucuronic acid) showing no significant differences in these two abies hybrid lines. this study defines specific agps containing β-(1→6)-galactotetraosyl group as a first molecular component of ecmsn covering embryogenic cells in gymnosperms. abstract. arabinogalactan-proteins (agps) are a family of extensively glycosylated hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins that are thought to have important roles in various aspects of plant growth and development. after a brief introduction to agps highlighting the problems associated with defining and classifying this diverse family of glycoproteins, agp structure is described in terms of the protein component (including data from molecular cloning), carbohydrate component, processing of agps (including recent data on glycosylphosphatidylinositol membrane anchors) and overall molecular shape. next, the expression of agps is examined at several different levels, from the whole plant to the cellular levels, using a variety of experimental techniques and tools. finally, agp function is considered. although the existing functional evidence is not incontrovertible, it does clearly point to roles for agps in vegetative, reproductive, and cellular growth and development as well as programmed cell death and social control. in addition and most likely inextricably linked to their functions, agps are presumably involved in molecular interactions and cellular signaling at the cell surface. some likely scenarios are discussed in this context. agps also have functions of real or potential commercial value, most notably as emulsifiers in the food industry and as potential immunological regulators for human health. several important questions remain to be answered with respect to agps. clearly, elucidating the unequivocal functions of particular agps and relating these functions to their respective structures and modes of action remain as major challenges in the years ahead.
background brain atrophy and cognitive dysfunction are neurodegenerative features of multiple sclerosis (ms). we used a candidate gene approach to address whether genetic variants implicated in susceptibility to late onset alzheimer's disease (ad) influence brain volume and cognition in ms patients. methods/principal findings ms subjects were genotyped for five single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) associated with susceptibility to ad: picalm, cr1, clu, pck1, and znf224. we assessed brain volume using brain parenchymal fraction (bpf) measurements obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (mri) data and cognitive function using the symbol digit modalities test (sdmt). genotypes were correlated with cross-sectional bpf and sdmt scores using linear regression after adjusting for sex, age at symptom onset, and disease duration. 722 ms patients with a mean (±sd) age at enrollment of 41 (±10) years were followed for 44 (±28) months. the ad risk-associated allele of a non-synonymous snp in the pck1 locus (rs8192708g) is associated with a smaller average brain volume (p = 0.0047) at the baseline mri, but it does not impact our baseline estimate of cognition. pck1 is additionally associated with higher baseline t2-hyperintense lesion volume (p = 0.0088). finally, we provide technical validation of our observation in a subset of 641 subjects that have more than one mri study, demonstrating the same association between pck1 and smaller average brain volume (p = 0.0089) at the last mri visit. conclusion/significance our study provides suggestive evidence for greater brain atrophy in ms patients bearing the pck1 allele associated with ad-susceptibility, yielding new insights into potentially shared neurodegenerative process between ms and late onset ad. whole-genome association studies (wgas) bring new computational, as well as analytic, challenges to researchers. many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. to address these issues, we developed plink, an open-source c/c++ wgas tool set. with plink, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. as well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, plink also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. we introduce plink and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. in particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. this information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.
among the methods currently used in phylogenomic practice to detect the presence of lateral gene transfer (lgt), one of the most frequently employed is the comparison of gene tree topologies for different genes. in cases where the phylogenies for different genes are incompatible, or discordant, for well-supported branches there are three simple interpretations for the result: 1) gene duplications (paralogy) followed by many independent gene losses have occurred, 2) lgt has occurred, or 3) the phylogeny is well supported but for reasons unknown is nonetheless incorrect. here, we focus on the third possibility by examining the properties of 22,437 published multiple sequence alignments, the bayesian maximum likelihood trees for which either do or do not suggest the occurrence of lgt by the criterion of discordant branches. the alignments that produce discordant phylogenies differ significantly in several salient alignment properties from those that do not. using a support vector machine, we were able to predict the inference of discordant tree topologies with up to 80% accuracy from alignment properties alone. the extent to which lateral genetic transfer has shaped microbial genomes has major implications for the emergence of community structures. we have performed a rigorous phylogenetic analysis of >220,000 proteins from genomes of 144 prokaryotes to determine the contribution of gene sharing to current prokaryotic diversity, and to identify "highways" of sharing between lineages. the inferred relationships suggest a pattern of inheritance that is largely vertical, but with notable exceptions among closely related taxa, and among distantly related organisms that live in similar environments.
here, a versatile data-driven application independent method to extend the depth of field is presented. the principal contribution in this effort is the use of features extracted by empirical mode decomposition, namely intrinsic mode images, for fusion. the input images are decomposed into intrinsic mode images and fusion is performed on the extracted oscillatory modes, by means of weighing schemes that allow emphasis of focused regions in each input image. the fused image unifies information from all focal planes, while maintaining the verisimilitude of the scene. in order to validate the fusion performance of our method, we have compared our results with those of region-based and multiscale decomposition based fusion techniques. several illustrative examples and objective comparisons are provided. this book addresses an area of perception engineering which deals with constructive processes. a model of the environment is analyzed using the information acquired from multiple viewpoints of multiple disparate sensors at multiple time instants. although the role of successive model building and active exploration of the environment, as is discussed in this book, is of great importance, only a few researchers of machine perception have thus far addressed the problem in these directions. krotkov's book, which is a modification and continuation of his highly successful dissertation, focuses on active exploratory sensing in the context of spatial layout perception. he uses stereo and focus to obtain distance by information, and to eventually develop cooperative combining techniques. means of a stereo system with verging cameras, it is demonstrated that the distance measurements can be significantly improved by combining two sources. in addition, the problem of merging information from the multiple views is discussed in detail. as the field of perception engineering seems to be of growing scientific and applied importance, both practitioners and researchers in machine perception will find this book a valuable addition to their libraries. rameshjain series editor acknowledgements i would like to thank professor ruzena bajcsy for her constant encouragement and guidance during the five years of research leading to the dissertation upon which this book is based. without her help in all matters, this work would never have been possible.
background over the years, several modifications of the scopinaro biliopancreatic diversion (bpd) have been proposed. this retrospective study reported the results of 15 years of follow-up after open bpd coupled with a type of transient gastroplasty (tg) and duodenal switch (ds), termed bpd-tg with ds.   methods data were analyzed for 874 patients operated on between january 1993 and may 2010 in 3 different surgical departments.   results the median preoperative body mass index (bmi) was 52 kg/m² (range, 35-63). comorbidities present were hypertension (57%), hypercholesterolemia (87%), hypertriglyceridemia (53%), type 2 diabetes (35%), and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (osas; 9%). the mean follow-up was 11.9 ± 3.1 years. the median bmi decreased to 33.9 after 1 year from bariatric surgery, 31.1 after 2-5 years, 30.9 after 5-10 years, and 31.2 kg/m² after 10-15 years. overall, 67% of diabetic patients were able to stop insulin and 97% were able to stop oral hypoglycemic drugs within 1 year. blood pressure, triglyceride levels, and cholesterol levels became normal in >96% of patients within 1 year. osas was resolved within 8 months in all cases. one year postoperatively, but absent thereafter, we observed severe hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin <3 g/dl) in 1.7% of patients and severe iron-deficiency anemia in 1.9%. incisional hernias were recorded in 30% and anastomotic ulcers in 2.4% of cases. mortality was null.   conclusion our results suggest considering bpd-tg with ds as a viable bariatric operation, with its excellent long-term outcome in terms of weight loss, improvement of obesity-related diseases, and quality of life. the bpd/ds, if properly performed, has the best long-term weight loss of any bariatric operation. it is easy to reverse or revise, has the least marginal ulcers, cures the highest percentage of co-morbidities, has the least failures, and permits normal although smaller meals. it is our opinion that the bpd/ds should be considered as the gold standard bariatric operation.
complex and interconnected signaling networks allow organisms to control cell division, growth, differentiation, or programmed cell death in response to metabolic and environmental cues. in plants, it is known that sugar and nitrogen are critical nutrient signals; however, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying nutrient signal transduction is very limited. to begin unraveling complex sugar signaling networks in plants, dna microarray analysis was used to determine the effects of glucose and inorganic nitrogen source on gene expression on a global scale in arabidopsis thaliana. in whole seedling tissue, glucose is a more potent signal in regulating transcription than inorganic nitrogen. in fact, other than genes associated with nitrate assimilation, glucose had a greater effect in regulating nitrogen metabolic genes than nitrogen itself. glucose also regulated a broader range of genes, including genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism, signal transduction, and metabolite transport. in addition, a large number of stress responsive genes were also induced by glucose, indicating a role of sugar in environmental responses. cluster analysis revealed significant interaction between glucose and nitrogen in regulating gene expression because glucose can modulate the effects of nitrogen and vise versa. intriguingly, cycloheximide treatment appeared to disrupt glucose induction more than glucose repression, suggesting that de novo protein synthesis is an intermediary event required before most glucose induction can occur. cross talk between sugar and ethylene signaling may take place on the transcriptional level because several ethylene biosynthetic and signal transduction genes are repressed by glucose, and the repression is largely unaffected by cycloheximide. collectively, our global expression data strongly support the idea that glucose and inorganic nitrogen act as both metabolites and signaling molecules. with the increase in genomewide experiments and the sequencing of multiple genomes, the analysis of large data sets has become commonplace in biology. it is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be significant. here we propose an approach to measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. this approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. in doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. the q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.
background:previous research has documented an underuse of long-term control medications among children with asthma, in nonadherence with national guidelines on asthma care. objectives:to determine if factors related to access and quality of asthma care are associated with underuse of long-term control medication among children with asthma. research design:a parent-report cross-sectional survey conducted in 26 randomly selected new york city public elementary schools. subjects:five thousand two hundred fifty children, of whom 912 had asthma. results:twenty-nine percent of children with asthma reported using a long-term control medication. among children with persistent asthma, defined as having one or more sleep disturbances due to asthma per week, 59.0% reported using a long-term control medication. after adjusting for demographic factors, children who had an asthma plan, had visited a doctor in the previous 6 months for nonurgent asthma care, or were enrolled in an asthma education program were more likely to use long-term control medication (odds ratios: 6.00, 4.11, 2.88, respectively). children of spanish-speaking parents, african american children, and children with no health insurance were the least likely to use long-term control medication (odds ratios: 0.51, 0.49, 0.20, respectively). children who reported recommended components of asthma care were the most likely to use their medication with appropriate frequency. conclusions:children who reported markers of high quality, personalized medical care, were more likely to use long-term control medication. these findings illustrate that components of the medical care received, and not only the demographic characteristics of the patient, are key factors in understanding the underuse of long-term control medication in urban children with asthma. purpose to examine daily use of antiinflammatory medication among children with asthma in east harlem, where hospitalization rates for asthma are among the highest in the united states.   methods we analyzed parent/guardian reports of medications used by children with current asthma (defined as physician diagnosis and wheezing during the previous 12 months) identified from a cross-sectional survey conducted in 2 elementary schools.   results from an overall sample of 1319 children, 298 with current asthma were included in this analysis. most of those with asthma were puerto rican (136 [46%]) or black (98 [33%]), 168 (57%) were boys, and the median age was 8 years old. overall, 65 (22%) were using antiinflammatory medication on a daily basis. a subgroup of 107 children with asthma had been hospitalized during the previous 12 months or had used beta(2)-agonist on a daily basis, suggesting persistent or severe asthma. of these 107 children, 42 (39%) were taking antiinflammatory medication on a daily basis. multivariate analysis of these 107 children revealed that daily use of antiinflammatory medication was associated with using a spacer tube (adjusted odds ratio [aor]: 3. 08; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.27,7.47) and having seen a physician in the past 6 months (aor: 3.46; ci: 1.01,11.9). compared with puerto ricans, blacks (aor:.32; ci:.12,.89) or children of other races/ethnicities (aor:.27; ci:.09,.85) were less likely to use antiinflammatory medication on a daily basis.   conclusion daily use of antiinflammatory medication for children with persistent or severe asthma in east harlem was underused. differences in access to care may explain some findings; however, reasons for ethnic differences in use remain unclear. both community interventions and additional provider education are needed.
the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster and its endoparasitoid wasps are a developing model system for interactions between host immune responses and parasite virulence mechanisms. in this system, wasps use diverse venom cocktails to suppress the conserved fly cellular encapsulation response. although numerous genetic tools allow detailed characterization of fly immune genes, lack of wasp genomic information has hindered characterization of the parasite side of the interaction. here, we use high-throughput nucleic acid and amino acid sequencing methods to describe the venoms of two related drosophila endoparasitoids with distinct infection strategies, leptopilina boulardi and l. heterotoma. using rna-seq, we assembled and quantified libraries of transcript sequences from female wasp abdomens. next, we used mass spectrometry to sequence peptides derived from dissected venom gland lumens. we then mapped the peptide spectral data against the abdomen transcriptomes to identify a set of putative venom genes for each wasp species. our approach captured the three venom genes previously characterized in l. boulardi by traditional cdna cloning methods as well as numerous new venom genes that were subsequently validated by a combination of rt-pcr, blast comparisons, and secretion signal sequence search. overall, 129 proteins were found to comprise l. boulardi venom and 176 proteins were found to comprise l. heterotoma venom. we found significant overlap in l. boulardi and l. heterotoma venom composition but also distinct differences that may underlie their unique infection strategies. our joint transcriptomic-proteomic approach for endoparasitoid wasp venoms is generally applicable to identification of functional protein subsets from any non-genome sequenced organism. the interpro database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) integrates together predictive models or ‘signatures’ representing protein domains, families and functional sites from multiple, diverse source databases: gene3d, panther, pfam, pirsf, prints, prodom, prosite, smart, superfamily and tigrfams. integration is performed manually and approximately half of the total ∼58 000 signatures available in the source databases belong to an interpro entry. recently, we have started to also display the remaining un-integrated signatures via our web interface. other developments include the provision of non-signature data, such as structural data, in new xml files on our ftp site, as well as the inclusion of matchless uniprotkb proteins in the existing match xml files. the web interface has been extended and now links out to the adan predicted protein–protein interaction database and the spice and dasty viewers. the latest public release (v18.0) covers 79.8% of uniprotkb (v14.1) and consists of 16 549 entries. interpro data may be accessed either via the web address above, via web services, by downloading files by anonymous ftp or by using the interproscan search software (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/tools/interproscan/).
a deformable registration method is described that enables automatic alignment of magnetic resonance (mr) and 3d transrectal ultrasound (trus) images of the prostate gland. the method employs a novel "model-to-image" registration approach in which a deformable model of the gland surface, derived from an mr image, is registered automatically to a trus volume by maximising the likelihood of a particular model shape given a voxel-intensity-based feature that represents an estimate of surface normal vectors at the boundary of the gland. the deformation of the surface model is constrained by a patient-specific statistical model of gland deformation, which is trained using data provided by biomechanical simulations. each simulation predicts the motion of a volumetric finite element mesh due to the random placement of a trus probe in the rectum. the use of biomechanical modelling in this way also allows a dense displacement field to be calculated within the prostate, which is then used to non-rigidly warp the mr image to match the trus image. using data acquired from eight patients, and anatomical landmarks to quantify the registration accuracy, the median final rms target registration error after performing 100 mr-trus registrations for each patient was 2.40 mm. a method is described for generating a patient-specific, statistical motion model (smm) of the prostate gland. finite element analysis (fea) is used to simulate the motion of the gland using an ultrasound-based 3d fe model over a range of plausible boundary conditions and soft-tissue properties. by applying principal component analysis to the displacements of the fe mesh node points inside the gland, the simulated deformations are then used as training data to construct the smm. the smm is used to both predict the displacement field over the whole gland and constrain a deformable surface registration algorithm, given only a small number of target points on the surface of the deformed gland. using 3d transrectal ultrasound images of the prostates of five patients, acquired before and after imposing a physical deformation, to evaluate the accuracy of predicted landmark displacements, the mean target registration error was found to be less than 1.9 mm.
gene duplication and divergence are overwhelmingly considered to be the primary mechanisms by which cytochrome p450 monooxygenases (p450s) have radiated into a large and diverse gene superfamily. to address how environmental stress drives the fixation and diversification of gene duplications, we have analyzed cyp12d1 and cyp12d3, a pair of duplicated genes found in the sequenced drosophila genomes of the melanogaster group. the paralog cyp12d3, which is not found in drosophilamelanogaster, is basal to the melanogaster group, after it split from the obscura group (ca. 50 mya), and has a significant signature of positive selection in two species (d. sechellia and d. ananassae). examination of the cyp12d1 region in d. melanogaster wildtype and isoline populations revealed variation both in copy number and sequence, including splice-site variations, which certainly alter gene function. further investigations of several strains have identified three cases in which differences in the cyp12d1 gene region are associated with the differences in transcript abundance and transcriptional responses to the environmental stresses that have not been seen for other detoxificative loci. together, these data highlight the value of using both macro- and microevolutionary approaches in studying the duplication and divergence events associated with detoxification genes and lay important groundwork for future studies in the field of evolutionary toxicogenomics, which uses the principles of phylogenetic analysis to predict possible enzymatic functions. the role that natural selection plays in governing the locations and early evolution of copy-number mutations remains largely unexplored. we used high-density full-genome tiling arrays to create a fine-scale genomic map of copy-number polymorphisms (cnps) in drosophila melanogaster. we inferred a total of 2658 independent cnps, 56% of which overlap genes. these include cnps that are likely to be under positive selection, most notably high-frequency duplications encompassing toxin-response genes. the locations and frequencies of cnps are strongly shaped by purifying selection, with deletions under stronger purifying selection than duplications. among duplications, those overlapping exons or introns, as well as those falling on the x chromosome, seem to be subject to stronger purifying selection.
purpose treatment of childhood relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all) remains a significant challenge. the goal of the children's oncology group (cog) aall01p2 study was to develop a safe and active chemotherapy reinduction platform, which could be used to evaluate novel agents in future trials.   patients and methods one hundred twenty-four patients with all and first marrow relapse received three, 35-day blocks of reinduction chemotherapy: 69 with early relapse (er; < 36 months from initial diagnosis) and 55 with late relapse (lr). minimal residual disease (mrd) was measured by flow cytometry after each treatment block.   results second complete remission (cr2) rates at the end of block 1 in 117 assessable patients were 68% +/- 6% for er (n = 63) and 96% +/- 3% for lr (n = 54; p < .0001). five of seven patients with t-cell all (t-all) failed to achieve cr2. among patients in cr2, mrd greater than 0.01% was detected at the end of block 1 in 75% +/- 7% of er (n = 36) versus 51% +/- 8% of lr (n = 43; p = .0375) and 12-month event-free survival was 80% +/- 7% versus 58% +/- 7% in mrd-negative versus positive patients (p < .0005). blocks 2 and 3 of therapy resulted in reduction of mrd burden in 40 of 56 patients who were mrd positive after block 1. toxicity was acceptable during all three blocks with five deaths (4%) from infections.   conclusion the aall01p2 regimen is a tolerable and active reinduction platform, suitable for testing in combination with novel agents in b-precursor all. alternative strategies are needed for t-all. serial mrd measurements were feasible and prognostic of outcome. the relapse rate in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all) is approximately 30% but few reinduction regimens have investigated the intensive use of polyethylene glycol escherichia coli asparaginase (peg-asp). therefore, we assessed the pharmocokinetics and efficacy of peg-asp in this setting. children with b-precursor all, in first marrow and/or extramedullary relapse were eligible. reinduction included doxorubicin on day 1, prednisone for 28 days, vincristine weekly for 4 weeks, and peg-asp either weekly or biweekly by randomization. asparaginase levels and antibody to both e coli asparaginase and peg-asp were measured weekly just before each peg-asp dose. overall, 129 of 144 patients (pts) (90%) achieved a complete remission (cr). there was a highly significant difference in cr rates between weekly (69 of 71; 97%) and biweekly (60 of 73; 82%) peg-asp dosing (p =.003). grade 3 or 4 infectious toxicity was common (50%), but only 4 pts died of sepsis during induction. other toxicities were infrequent and hypersensitivity was rare (6 of 144; 4%). low asparaginase levels were associated with high antibody titers to either native (p =.024) or peg asp (p =.0013). the cr rate was significantly associated with higher levels of asparaginase (p =. 012). patients with all in first relapse receiving weekly peg-asp had a higher rate of second remission compared with biweekly dosing. low levels of asparaginase were associated with high antibody titers. increased asparaginase levels may correlate with an improved cr rate. the use of intensive peg-asp should be explored further in the treatment of all.

we propose hashing to facilitate efficient kernels. this generalizes previous work using sampling and we show a principled way to compute the kernel matrix for data streams and sparse feature spaces. moreover, we give deviation bounds from the exact kernel matrix. this has applications to estimation on strings and graphs. using extensions of linear algebra concepts to reproducing kernel hilbert spaces (rkhs), we define a unifying framework for random walk kernels on graphs. reduction to a sylvester equation allows us to compute many of these kernels in o(n3) worst-case time. this includes kernels whose previous worst-case time complexity was o(n6), such as the geometric kernels of gartner et al. [1] and the marginal graph kernels of kashima et al. [2]. our algebra in rkhs allow us to exploit sparsity in directed and undirected graphs more effectively than previous methods, yielding sub-cubic computational complexity when combined with conjugate gradient solvers or fixed-point iterations. experiments on graphs from bioinformatics and other application domains show that our algorithms are often more than 1000 times faster than existing approaches.
objective in the past few decades, consumption of added sugars has increased dramatically. studies have linked high sugar intake with increased risk for a number of diseases. importantly, fructose, a component of sugar, has been linked with the development of features of metabolic syndrome. this study determined if single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes involved in fructose transport (solute carrier family 2 facilitated glucose transporter, member 2 (slc2a2) and solute carrier family 2 facilitated glucose/fructose transporter, member 5 (slc2a5)) and metabolism (ketohexokinase (khk)) affect inter-individual variability in metabolic phenotypes, such as increased serum uric acid levels. materials/methods the influence of slc2a2, slc2a5, and khk snps on metabolic phenotypes was tested in 237 european americans and 167 african americans from the pharmacogenomic evaluation and antihypertensive responses (pear) study. using baseline untreated fasting data, associations were considered significant if p≤0.005. these snps were then evaluated for potential replication (p≤0.05) using data from the genetic epidemiology of responses to antihypertensives (gera) studies. results slc2a5 rs5438 was associated with an increase in serum uric acid in european american males. however, we were unable to replicate the association in gera. the minor allele of slc2a2 rs8192675 showed an association with lower high-density lipoproteins in european americans (a/a: 51.0 mg/dl, a/g: 47.0 mg/dl, g/g: 41.5 mg/dl, p = 0.0034) in pear. the association between rs8192675 and lower high-density lipoproteins was replicated in the combined european american gera study samples (a/a: 47.6 mg/dl, a/g: 48.6 mg/dl, g/g: 41.9 mg/dl, p = 0.0315). conclusions the association between slc2a2 rs8192675 and high-density lipoproteins suggests the polymorphism may play a role in influencing high-density lipoproteins and thus metabolic risk of cardiovascular disease. the oral or intravenous administration of fructose to children results in dramatic rises in both urate and lactate concentrations in serum and an increase in the excretion of uric acid in the urine, findings interpreted as being caused by rapid nucleic acid degradation due to the increased intracellular lactic acidosis in the liver (perheentupa and raivio, 1967). as lactate also reduces renal excretion of urate (yu, sirota, halpern, and gutman, 1967), these authors were unable to assess the relative importance of hepatic and renal factors in the resultant hyperuricaemia, but the increase in the urinary uric acid suggested either a sudden increase in urate production or a shift of urate from an intracellular pool to the extracellular fluid. moreover, fox and kelley (1972) were unable to demonstrate any consistent decrease in the fractional clearance of urate after fructose infusions. studies in cebus monkeys have also demonstrated hyperuricaemia and increases in urinary uric acid excretion after infusions of high concentrations of hexoses, fructose having the greatest effect and glucose a lesser effect (simkin, 1969). this has not been a uniform finding, however, and no significant changes in serum urate concentrations were demonstrated during the 3 hrs after the intravenous administration of 100 g. fructose to ten young adult males (curreri and pruitt, 1970). because of the conflicting evidence, the lack of information concerning the possible mechanism involved and the potential importance in patients with hyperuricaemia, it was decided to compare the effect of diets containing large quantities of either added fructose or glucose on urate metabolism, as reflected by the miscible urate pool and turnover rate and the simultaneous incorporation of glycine into both urinary and produced uric acid.
this study investigated (1) the effect of repetitive weight-relief raises (wr) and shoulder external rotation (er) on the acromiohumeral distance (ahd) among manual wheelchair users (mwus) and (2) the relationship between shoulder pain, subject characteristics, and ahd changes. twenty-three mwus underwent ultrasound imaging of the nondominant shoulder in an unloaded baseline position and while holding a wr position before and after the wr/er tasks. paired t-tests and spearman correlational analysis were used to assess differences in the ahd before and after each task and the relationships between pain, subject characteristics, and the ahd measures. a significant reduction in the subacromial space (p < 0.01) occurred when subjects performed a wr position compared to baseline. individuals with increased years of disability had greater ahd percentage narrowing after wr (p = 0.008). increased shoulder pain was associated with ahd percentage narrowing after er (p ≤ 0.007). the results support clinical practice guidelines that recommend mwus limit wr to preserve shoulder function. the isolated repetitive shoulder activity did not contribute to the changes of subacromial space in mwus. the ultrasonographic measurement of the ahd may be a target for identifying future interventions that prevent pain. abstract objective to investigate the reliability of ultrasonographic measurement of acromiohumeral distance (ahd) and the effects of shoulder positioning on ahd among manual wheelchair users (mwus) with spinal cord injury (sci) and an able-bodied control group. methods ten mwus with sci and 10 able-bodied subjects participated in this study. the ultrasonographic measurements of ahd from each subject were obtained by two raters during passive and active scapular plane arm elevation in neutral, 45°, 90° with and without resistance and in a weight relief raise position. the measurements were recorded again by each rater using the same procedures after a 30-minute time interval. all raters were blinded to each other's measurements. setting university laboratories and veteran affairs healthcare system. results intra-rater (intraclass correlation coefficient, icc > 0.83) and inter-rater (icc > 0.78) reliability was excellent for both the mwus with sci and able-bodied groups across all arm positions except for the 45° position in the control group for one of the raters (intra-rater: icc < 0.40 and inter-rater: icc < 0.60). ahd significantly reduced when the shoulder was in the 90° arm elevated positions with or without resistance. conclusion findings from our study demonstrated that ultrasonography is a reliable means to evaluate ahd in both able bodied and individuals with sci, who are known to have significant shoulder pathology. this technique could be used to develop reference measures and to identify changes in ahd caused by interventions.
intraindividual variability among cognitive domains may predict dementia independently of interindividual differences in cognition. a multidomain cognitive battery was administered to 2305 older adult women (mean age 74 years) enrolled in an ancillary study of the women's health initiative. women were evaluated annually for probable dementia and mild cognitive impairment (mci) for an average of 5.3 years using a standardized protocol. proportional hazards regression showed that lower baseline domain-specific cognitive scores significantly predicted mci (n = 74), probable dementia (n = 45), and mci or probable dementia combined (n = 101) and that verbal and figural memory predicted each outcome independently of all other cognitive domains. the baseline intraindividual standard deviation across test scores (iav cognitive domains) significantly predicted probable dementia and this effect was attenuated by interindividual differences in verbal episodic memory. slope increases in iav cognitive domains across measurement occasions (iav time) explained additional risk for mci and mci or probable dementia, beyond that accounted for by interindividual differences in multiple cognitive measures, but risk for probable dementia was attenuated by mean decreases in verbal episodic memory slope. these findings demonstrate that within-person variability across cognitive domains both at baseline and longitudinally independently accounts for risk of cognitive impairment and dementia in support of the predictive utility of within-person variability. context some studies of hormone treatment in postmenopausal women suggest benefits on specific cognitive functions, particularly memory.   objective the objective of this study was to determine whether hormone therapy influences changes in specific cognitive functions and affect in older women.   design this study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.   setting participants were women from 14 of 40 clinical centers of the women's health initiative (whi).   participants postmenopausal women (1416) aged 65 yr and older, free of probable dementia, and enrolled in whi and the whi memory study (whims) trial of combination estrogen and progestin for a mean of 3 yr and followed for a mean of 1.35 yr, were studied.   intervention intervention was conjugated equine estrogen (cee; 0.625 mg) with 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (mpa) in one daily tablet (cee + mpa) or placebo.   main outcome measures annual rates of change in specific cognitive functions and affect, adjusted for time since randomization, were measured.   results cee + mpa had a negative impact on verbal memory (p <or= 0.01) and a trend to a positive impact on figural memory (p = 0.012) over time compared with placebo, but other cognitive domains were not affected. both effects on memory were evident only after long-term therapy. cee + mpa did not significantly influence positive affect, negative affect, or depressive symptoms.   conclusions the effect of cee + mpa on cognitive function varies across cognitive domains in older women, reflecting both possible beneficial and detrimental actions of ovarian steroids on the aging brain. our results extend prior findings about dementia and global cognitive function to age-related changes in specific cognitive functions and suggest directions for future research.
the purpose of the study was to expand a model of motor unit recruitment and rate coding (30) to simulate the adjustments that occur during a fatiguing contraction. the major new components of the model were the introduction of time-varying parameters for motor unit twitch force, recruitment, discharge rate, and discharge variability, and a control algorithm that estimates the net excitation needed by the motoneuron pool to maintain a prescribed target force. the fatigue-induced changes in motor unit activity in the expanded model are a function of changes in the metabolite concentrations that were computed with a compartment model of the intra- and extracellular spaces. the model was validated by comparing the simulation results with data available from the literature and experimentally recorded in the present study during isometric contractions of the first dorsal interosseus muscle. the output of the model was able to replicate a number of experimental findings, including the time to task failure for a range of target forces, the changes in motor unit discharge rates, the skewness and kurtosis of the interspike interval distributions, discharge variability, and the discharge characteristics of newly recruited motor units. the model output provides an integrative perspective of the adjustments during fatiguing contractions that are difficult to measure experimentally. aim to test the hypothesis that time-wise increase in intramuscular pressure (imp) and subsequent decrease in muscle tissue oxygenation (to(2)) results in muscle fatigue development during a non-exhaustive, low-force contraction evidenced by changes in electromyogram (emg) and particular mechanomyogram (mmg).   methods seven subjects performed static elbow flexion at 10% maximal voluntary contraction (mvc) for 10 min (10% mvc(10 min)). surface emg, mmg, imp and to(2) measured by near-infrared spectroscopy was recorded from m. biceps brachii during 10% mvc(10 min) and during 5% mvc test contractions of 1 min duration performed before 10% mvc(10 min), 10 and 30 min post-exercise. emg and mmg were analysed for root mean square (rms) and mean power frequency (mpf).   results during 10% mvc(10 min) mmgrms increased from initial level of 0.04 +/- 0.01 to 0.11 +/- 0.07 m s(-2) in the last minute and mmgmpf and emgmpf decreased from 34.9 +/- 8.2 to 21.3 +/- 3.8 hz and from 71.7 +/- 10.9 to 61.7 +/- 10.0 hz respectively. similar changes were present in 5% mvc test contractions 30 min post-exercise. initially, to(2) decreased by 6.9 +/- 6.5% of resting level but returned to rest within 1 min. imp remained constant during the contraction after an initial fourfold increase from resting level of 12.2 +/- 10.4 mmhg.   conclusions imp was anticipated to increase with time of contraction due to e.g. increased muscle water content; but this was not confirmed. consequently, muscle blood flow was unlikely to be impeded with contraction time, which may account for the maintenance of to(2). thus, decreased to(2) did not underlie either acute or long-term muscle fatigue development evidenced by changes in emg and particular mmg variables.
background pre-restorative crown lengthening surgery (cls) is a common periodontal procedure, for which systematic reviews are lacking. this systematic review aimed to assess outcomes of cls performed for restorative reasons.   methods databases (medline, scopus, opengrey) were searched up to january 2016 for clinical/animal trials on cls for restorative reasons with ≥6-month follow-up. primary outcomes investigated were: free gingival margin position, probing depth, clinical attachment level, and plaque/inflammation indices.   results four non-randomized and one randomized controlled clinical trial and one controlled animal trial were included. heterogeneity and high risk of bias were identified. cls resulted in increased crown length (6-month average: 1.4-3.3 mm). between immediate postsurgery and follow-up, gingival margin may rebound, largely during the first three postoperative months. technical (flap positioning, osseous resection, root preparation) and anatomical (periodontal biotype) factors influence outcomes. the literature lacks studies on tooth mobility, crown-root ratio, patient- and referring dentist-reported outcomes, surgical technique comparisons, and restorative treatment timing.   conclusions within the available data limitations, it is concluded that cls results in increased crown length and possible gingival margin rebound. technical aspects (primarily) and anatomical factors (secondarily) influence outcomes. future research is needed to fill significant voids in our knowledge on several procedural aspects. surgical crown lengthening has been proposed as a means of facilitating restorative procedures and preventing injuries in teeth with structurally inadequate clinical crown or exposing tooth structure in the presence of deep, subgingival pathologies which may hamper the access for proper restorative measures. histological studies utilizing animal models have shown that postoperative crestal resorption allowed reestablishment of the biologic width. however, very little has been done in humans. aims. the purpose of the study was to evaluate the potential changes in the periodontal tissues, particularly the biologic width, following surgical crown lengthening by two surgical procedures before and after crown placement. methods and material. twenty (20) patients who needed surgical crown lengthening to gain retention necessary for prosthetic treatment and/or to access caries, tooth fracture, or previous prosthetic margins entered the study. the following parameters were obtained from line angles of treated teeth (teeth requiring surgical crown lengthening) and adjacent sites: plaque and gingival indices (pi) & (gi), position of gingival margin from reference stent (pgmrs), probing depth (pd), and biologic width (bw). statistical analysis used. student “t” test. results. initial baseline values of biologic width were 2.55 mm (gingivectomy procedure b1 group) and 1.95 mm (ostectomy procedure b2 group) and after surgical procedure the values were 1.15 mm and 1.25 mm. conclusions. within the limitations of the study the biologic width, at treated sites, was re-established to its original vertical dimension by 3 months. ostectomy with apically positioned flap can be considered as a more effective procedure than gingivectomy for surgical crown lengthening.
backgroundan updated economic evaluation was conducted to compare the cost-effectiveness of the four tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-α inhibitors adalimumab, etanercept, golimumab and infliximab in active, progressive psoriatic arthritis (psa) where response to standard treatment has been inadequate.methodsa systematic review was conducted to identify relevant, recently published studies and the new trial data were synthesised, via a bayesian network meta-analysis (nma), to estimate the relative efficacy of the tnf-α inhibitors in terms of psoriatic arthritis response criteria (psarc) response, health assessment questionnaire (haq) scores and psoriasis area and severity index (pasi). a previously developed economic model was updated with the new meta-analysis results and current cost data. the model was adapted to delineate patients by pasi 50%, 75% and 90% response rates to differentiate between psoriasis outcomes.resultsall four licensed tnf-α inhibitors were significantly more effective than placebo in achieving psarc response in patients with active psa. adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab were significantly more effective than placebo in improving haq scores in patients who had achieved a psarc response and in improving haq scores in psarc non-responders. in an analysis using 1,000 model simulations, on average etanercept was the most cost-effective treatment and, at the national institute for health and care excellence willingness-to-pay threshold of between £20,000 to £30,000, etanercept is the preferred option.conclusionsthe economic analysis agrees with the conclusions from the previous models, in that biologics are shown to be cost-effective for treating patients with active psa compared with the conventional management strategy. in particular, etanercept is cost-effective compared with the other biologic treatments. indirect and mixed treatment comparison (mtc) approaches to synthesis are logical extensions of more established meta-analysis methods. they have great potential for estimating the comparative effectiveness of multiple treatments using an evidence base of trials that individually do not compare all treatment options. connected networks of evidence can be synthesized simultaneously to provide estimates of the comparative effectiveness of all included treatments and a ranking of their effectiveness with associated probability statements.the potential of the use of indirect and mtc methods in technology assessment is considerable, and would allow for a more consistent assessment than simpler alternative approaches. although such models can be viewed as a logical and coherent extension of standard pair-wise meta-analysis, their increased complexity raises some unique issues with far-reaching implications concerning how we use data in technology assessment, while simultaneously raising searching questions about standard pair-wise meta-analysis. this article reviews pair-wise meta-analysis and indirect and mtc approaches to synthesis, clearly outlining the assumptions involved in each approach. it also raises the issues that the national institute for health and clinical excellence (nice) needed to consider in updating their 2004 guide to the methods of technology appraisal, if such methods are to be used in their technology appraisals.
there is a shortage of registered nurses in developed countries, and this shortage is due to the aging nursing workforce, demand for healthcare services, and shortage of nursing professors to teach students. in order to increase the number of clinical placements for nursing students, the authors developed and implemented a collaborative preceptorship model between a canadian university and public health department to facilitate the clinical experiences of bachelor of science of nursing (bscn) students. this paper describes the team preceptorship model which guided the clinical experience of nine students and 14 preceptors. it also highlights the model's evaluation, strengths, and limitations. content analysis is a widely used qualitative research technique. rather than being a single method, current applications of content analysis show three distinct approaches: conventional, directed, or summative. all three approaches are used to interpret meaning from the content of text data and, hence, adhere to the naturalistic paradigm. the major differences among the approaches are coding schemes, origins of codes, and threats to trustworthiness. in conventional content analysis, coding categories are derived directly from the text data. with a directed approach, analysis starts with a theory or relevant research findings as guidance for initial codes. a summative content analysis involves counting and comparisons, usually of keywords or content, followed by the interpretation of the underlying context. the authors delineate analytic procedures specific to each approach and techniques addressing trustworthiness with hypothetical examples drawn from the area of end-of-life care.
background suspected genetic causes for extracellular matrix (ecm) dysregulation in the ascending aorta in patients with bicuspid aortic valves (bav) have influenced strategies and thresholds for surgical resection of bav aortopathy. using 4-dimensional (4d) flow cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cmr), we have documented increased regional wall shear stress (wss) in the ascending aorta of bav patients.   objectives this study assessed the relationship between wss and regional aortic tissue remodeling in bav patients to determine the influence of regional wss on the expression of ecm dysregulation.   methods bav patients (n = 20) undergoing ascending aortic resection underwent pre-operative 4d flow cmr to regionally map wss. paired aortic wall samples (i.e., within-patient samples obtained from regions of elevated and normal wss) were collected and compared for medial elastin degeneration by histology and ecm regulation by protein expression.   results regions of increased wss showed greater medial elastin degradation compared to adjacent areas with normal wss: decreased total elastin (p = 0.01) with thinner fibers (p = 0.00007) that were farther apart (p = 0.001). multiplex protein analyses of ecm regulatory molecules revealed an increase in transforming growth factor β-1 (p = 0.04), matrix metalloproteinase (mmp)-1 (p = 0.03), mmp-2 (p = 0.06), mmp-3 (p = 0.02), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (p = 0.04) in elevated wss regions, indicating ecm dysregulation in regions of high wss.   conclusions regions of increased wss correspond with ecm dysregulation and elastic fiber degeneration in the ascending aorta of bav patients, implicating valve-related hemodynamics as a contributing factor in the development of aortopathy. further study to validate the use of 4d flow cmr as a noninvasive biomarker of disease progression and its ability to individualize resection strategies is warranted. to evaluate an improved image acquisition and data‐processing strategy for assessing aortic vascular geometry and 3d blood flow at 3t.
initially discovered as abundant components of eukaryotic cell membranes, sphingolipids are now recognized as important bioactive signaling molecules that modulate a variety of cellular functions, including those relevant to cancer and immunologic, inflammatory, and cardiovascular disorders. in this review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the role of sphingosine-1-phosphate (s1p) receptors in the regulation of vascular function, and focus on how de novo biosynthesized sphingolipids play a role in blood pressure homeostasis. the therapeutic potential of new drugs that target s1p signaling is also discussed. sphingosine kinase 1 (sphk1) and sphk2 are ubiquitous enzymes that generate sphingosine-1-phosphate (s1p), a ligand for a family of g protein-coupled receptors (s1pr1-s1pr5) with important functions in the vascular and immune systems. here we explore the role of these kinases and receptors in recovery from anaphylaxis in mice. we found that sphk2-/- mice had a rapid recovery from anaphylaxis. in contrast, sphk1-/- mice showed poor recovery from anaphylaxis and delayed histamine clearance. injection of s1p into sphk1-/- mice increased histamine clearance and promoted recovery from anaphylaxis. adoptive cell transfer experiments demonstrated that sphk1 activity was required in both the hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic compartments for recovery from anaphylaxis. mice lacking the s1p receptor s1pr2 also showed a delay in plasma histamine clearance and a poor recovery from anaphylaxis. however, s1p did not promote the recovery of s1pr2-/- mice from anaphylaxis, whereas s1pr2+/- mice showed partial recovery. unlike sphk2-/- mice, sphk1-/- and s1pr2-/- mice had severe hypotension during anaphylaxis. thus, sphk1-produced s1p regulates blood pressure, histamine clearance, and recovery from anaphylaxis in a manner that involves s1pr2. this suggests that specific s1pr2 agonists may serve to counteract the vasodilation associated with anaphylactic shock.
approximately half of the retinal ganglion cells (rgcs) present in the rodent retina at birth normally die during early development. overexpression of the proto-oncogene bcl-2 recently has been shown to rescue some neuronal populations from natural cell death and from degeneration induced by axotomy of nerves within the peripheral nervous system. here we study in vivo the role of the overexpression of bcl-2 in the natural cell death of rgcs and in the degenerative process induced in these cells by transection of the optic nerve. we find that in newborn bcl-2 transgenic mice, the number of rgcs undergoing natural cell death is considerably lower than in wild-type pups. consistently, a vast majority (90%) of the ganglion cells found in the retina of neonatal transgenics are maintained in adulthood, whereas only 40% survive in wild-type mice. after transection of the optic nerve, the number of degenerating ganglion cells, determined by counting pyknotic nuclei or nuclei with fragmented dna, is substantially reduced in transgenic mice. in wild-type animals, almost 50% of ganglion cells degenerate in the 24 hr after the lesion, whereas almost the entire ganglion cell population survives axotomy in transgenic mice. therefore, overexpression of bcl-2 is effective in preventing degeneration of this neuronal population, raising the possibility that ganglion cells are dependent on the endogenous expression of bcl-2 for survival. the remarkable rescue capacity of bcl-2 overexpression in these neurons makes it an interesting model for studying natural cell death and responses to injury in the cns. the patterns of cell death and division are described in the normal postnatal rat retina and following transection of the optic nerve on the day of birth. optic nerve transection on the day of birth results in the rapid degeneration of the ganglion cells. mitosis at the outer retinal surface ceases first in the temporal retina, then in the nasal retina and becomes progressively more restricted to peripheral regions. mitotic activity was not affected by the loss of ganglion cells. cell death takes place in a wave passing from the ganglion cell to the inner nuclear to the outer nuclear layer. the time course of cell death is not affected by the loss of ganglion cells following optic nerve transection, and there is no significant increase in the number of cells which degenerate in the inner nuclear layer. the effects of removing a major postsynaptic target of local circuit neurones appears to be less pronounced than has been reported for relay neurones.
aims/hypothesisdiabetes interferes with bone formation and impairs fracture healing, an important complication in humans and animal models. the aim of this study was to examine the impact of diabetes on mesenchymal stem cells (mscs) during fracture repair.methodsfracture of the long bones was induced in a streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic mouse model with or without insulin or a specific tnfα inhibitor, pegsunercept. mscs were detected with cluster designation-271 (also known as p75 neurotrophin receptor) or stem cell antigen-1 (sca-1) antibodies in areas of new endochondral bone formation in the calluses. msc apoptosis was measured by tunel assay and proliferation was measured by ki67 antibody. in vitro apoptosis and proliferation were examined in c3h10t1/2 and human-bone-marrow-derived mscs following transfection with foxo1 small interfering (si)rna.resultsdiabetes significantly increased tnfα levels and reduced msc numbers in new bone area. msc numbers were restored to normal levels with insulin or pegsunercept treatment. inhibition of tnfα significantly reduced msc loss by increasing msc proliferation and decreasing msc apoptosis in diabetic animals, but had no effect on mscs in normoglycaemic animals. in vitro experiments established that tnfα alone was sufficient to induce apoptosis and inhibit proliferation of mscs. furthermore, silencing forkhead box protein o1 (foxo1) prevented tnfα-induced msc apoptosis and reduced proliferation by regulating apoptotic and cell cycle genes.conclusions/interpretationdiabetes-enhanced tnfα significantly reduced msc numbers in new bone areas during fracture healing. mechanistically, diabetes-enhanced tnfα reduced msc proliferation and increased msc apoptosis. reducing the activity of tnfα in vivo may help to preserve endogenous mscs and maximise regenerative potential in diabetic patients. chemokines are thought to play an important role in several aspects of bone metabolism including the recruitment of leukocytes and the formation of osteoclasts. we investigated the impact of diabetes on chemokine expression in normal and diabetic fracture healing. fracture of the femur was performed in streptozotocin-induced diabetic and matched normoglycemic control mice. microarray analysis was carried out and chemokine mrna levels in vivo were assessed. ccl4 were examined in fracture calluses by immunohistochemistry and the role of tnf in diabetes-enhanced expression was investigated by treatment of animals with the tnf-specific inhibitor, pegsunercept. in vitro studies were conducted with atdc5 chondrocytes. diabetes significantly upregulated mrna levels of several chemokines in vivo including ccl4, ccl8, ccl6, ccl11, ccl20, ccl24, cxcl2, cxcl5 and chemokine receptors ccr5 and cxcr4. chondrocytes were identified as a significant source of ccl4 and its expression in diabetic fractures was dependent on tnf (p<0.05). tnf-α significantly increased mrna levels of several chemokines in vitro which were knocked down with foxo1 sirna (p<0.05). ccl4 expression at the mrna and proteins levels was induced by foxo1 over-expression and reduced by foxo1 knockdown. the current studies point to the importance of tnf-α as a mechanism for diabetes enhanced chemokine expression by chondrocytes, which may contribute to the accelerated loss of cartilage observed in diabetic fracture healing. moreover, in vitro results point to foxo1 as a potentially important transcription factor in mediating this effect.
explaining regulatory mechanisms is crucial to understand complex cellular responses leading to system perturbations. some strategies reverse engineer regulatory interactions from experimental data, while others identify functional regulatory units (modules) under the assumption that biological systems yield a modular organization. most modular studies focus on network structure and static properties, ignoring that gene regulation is largely driven by stimulus-response behavior. expression time series are key to gain insight into dynamics, but have been insufficiently explored by current methods, which often (1) apply generic algorithms unsuited for expression analysis over time, due to inability to maintain the chronology of events or incorporate time dependency; (2) ignore local patterns, abundant in most interesting cases of transcriptional activity; (3) neglect physical binding or lack automatic association of regulators, focusing mainly on expression patterns; or (4) limit the discovery to a predefined number of modules. we propose regulatory snapshots, an integrative mining approach to identify regulatory modules over time by combining transcriptional control with response, while overcoming the above challenges. temporal biclustering is first used to reveal transcriptional modules composed of genes showing coherent expression profiles over time. personalized ranking is then applied to prioritize prominent regulators targeting the modules at each time point using a network of documented regulatory associations and the expression data. custom graphics are finally depicted to expose the regulatory activity in a module at consecutive time points (snapshots). regulatory snapshots successfully unraveled modules underlying yeast response to heat shock and human epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, based on regulations documented in the yeastract and jaspar databases, respectively, and available expression data. regulatory players involved in functionally enriched processes related to these biological events were identified. ranking scores further suggested ability to discern the primary role of a gene (target or regulator). prototype is available at: http://kdbio.inesc-id.pt/software/regulatorysnapshots. a large number of clustering approaches have been proposed for the analysis of gene expression data obtained from microarray experiments. however, the results from the application of standard clustering methods to genes are limited. this limitation is imposed by the existence of a number of experimental conditions where the activity of genes is uncorrelated. a similar limitation exists when clustering of conditions is performed. for this reason, a number of algorithms that perform simultaneous clustering on the row and column dimensions of the data matrix has been proposed. the goal is to find submatrices, that is, subgroups of genes and subgroups of conditions, where the genes exhibit highly correlated activities for every condition. in this paper, we refer to this class of algorithms as biclustering. biclustering is also referred in the literature as coclustering and direct clustering, among others names, and has also been used in fields such as information retrieval and data mining. in this comprehensive survey, we analyze a large number of existing approaches to biclustering, and classify them in accordance with the type of biclusters they can find, the patterns of biclusters that are discovered, the methods used to perform the search, the approaches used to evaluate the solution, and the target applications.
diese dissertation ist auf den internetseiten der hochschulbibliothek online verfügbar. the topographical relations of the visual field with the superior colliculus of the rat was investigated using constant small visual stimuli and recording the electrical response of aggregate unit activity with fine tip metal microelectrodes. a precise essentially linear projection onto the contralateral colliculus was demonstrated after appropriate corrections for brain curvature were performed. the general pattern and arrangement of the retinotopic projection is similar to that found in infra‐mammalian vertebrates. an ipsilateral projection appears to be absent. the phasic properties and rhythmic discharge patterns of single units in the coliculus were studied with stationary and moving luminous stimuli.
the oxygen cost of breathing represents a significant fraction of total oxygen uptake during intense exercise. at a given ventilation, women have a greater work of breathing compared with men, and because work is linearly related to oxygen uptake we hypothesized that their oxygen cost of breathing would also be greater. for a given ventilation, women had a greater absolute oxygen cost of breathing, and this represented a greater fraction of total oxygen uptake. regardless of sex, those who developed expiratory flow limitation had a greater oxygen cost of breathing at maximal exercise. the greater oxygen cost of breathing in women indicates that a greater fraction of total oxygen uptake (and possibly cardiac output) is directed to the respiratory muscles, which may influence blood flow distribution during exercise. the oxygen cost of exercise hyperpnea (v˙(o2 rm)) has been quantified using a variety of techniques with inconsistent findings. between-study variation relates to poor control of breathing patterns and lung mechanics. we developed a methodology allowing precise matching of exercising wob in order to estimate v˙(o2 rm). thirteen healthy young subjects (7 male) completed an incremental cycle exercise test, familiarization and experimental days where exercise hyperpnea was mimicked. on experimental days, feedback of exercise flow, volume and the respiratory pressures were provided while end-tidal co2 was kept at exercise levels during each 5-min trial. minute ventilation levels between 50 and 100% maximum were mimicked 3-5 times. the r(2) between exercise and mimic trails was 0.99 for frequency, tidal volume and minute ventilation; 0.86 for esophageal pressure swings and 0.93 for wob. the coefficient of variation for (v˙(o2) averaged 4.3, 4.4 and 5.7% for 50, 75 and 100% ventilation trials. when wob and other respiratory parameters are tightly controlled, the v˙(o2 rm) can be consistently estimated.
we present a new approach for contextual semantic segmentation and introduce a new tree-based framework, which combines local information and context knowledge in a single model. the method itself is also suitable for anytime classification scenarios, where the challenge is to estimate a label for each pixel in an image while allowing an interruption of the estimation at any time. this offers the application of the introduced method in time-critical tasks, like automotive applications, with limited computational resources unknown in advance. label estimation is done in an iterative manner and includes spatial context right from the beginning. our approach is evaluated in extensive experiments showing its state-of-the-art performance on challenging street scene datasets with anytime classification abilities. we present a fast line segment tracker which does not require any knowledge about the motion of the camera nor the structure of the observed scene. it runs on 320 times 240 pixel images at 30 hz. we adapted the rapid tracker with a new way of handling multiple line hypotheses to deal with the simple model of a single line segment. we discuss the difficulty of using a chi2-test as merging criterion and also present a new approach to overcome it. furthermore, instead of making assumptions about the camera motion, a constant velocity motion model to predict the line segment position in the following frame is used. we explain how to deal with the instability of the endpoint extraction in this motion model to avoid unintentional motion along the line. finally, we present results on real world indoor and urban outdoor image sequences.
background. despite a growing clinical need, there are no clear guidelines on assessment of lexical access in the two languages in individuals with bilingual aphasia. objective. in this study, we examined the influence of language proficiency on three tasks requiring lexical access in english and spanish bilingual normal controls and in bilingual individuals with aphasia. methods. 12 neurologically healthy spanish-english bilinguals and 10 spanish-english bilinguals with aphasia participated in the study. all participants completed three lexical retrieval tasks: two picture-naming tasks (bnt, bpnt) and a category generation (cg) task. results. this study found that across all tasks, the greatest predictors for performance were the effect of group and language ability rating (lar). bilingual controls had a greater score or produced more correct responses than participants with bilingual aphasia across all tasks. the results of our study also indicate that normal controls and bilinguals with aphasia make similar types of errors in both english and spanish and develop similar clustering strategies despite significant performance differences between the groups. conclusions. differences between bilingual patients and controls demonstrate a fundamental lexical retrieval deficit in bilingual individuals with aphasia, but one that is further influenced by language proficiency in the two languages. purpose the effect of semantic naming treatment on crosslinguistic generalization was investigated in 3 participants with english-spanish bilingual aphasia.   method a single-subject experimental designed was used. participants received semantic treatment to improve naming of english or spanish items, while generalization was tested to untrained semantically related items in the trained language and translations of the trained and untrained items in the untrained language.   results results demonstrated a within- and across-languages effect on generalization related to premorbid language proficiencies. participant 1 (p1; equal premorbid proficiency across languages) showed within-language generalization in the trained language (spanish) as well as crosslinguistic generalization to the untrained language (english). participant 2 (p2) and participant (p3) were more proficient premorbidly in english. with treatment in english, p2 showed within-language generalization to semantically related items, but no crosslinguistic generalization. with treatment in spanish, both p2 and p3 exhibited no within-language generalization, but crosslinguistic generalization to english (dominant language) occurred. error analyses indicated an evolution of errors as a consequence of treatment.   conclusions these results are preliminary because all participants were not treated in both languages. however, the results suggest that training the less dominant language may be more beneficial in facilitating crosslinguistic generalization than training the more proficient language in an unbalanced bilingual individual.
we explored how lateral line cues interact with visual cues to mediate flow sensing behaviors in the nocturnal developing frog, xenopus laevis, by exposing animals to current flows under different lighting conditions and after exposure to the ototoxin gentamicin. under dark conditions, xenopus tadpoles move downstream at the onset of current flow, then turn, and orient toward the direction of the flow with high accuracy. postmetamorphic froglets also exhibit positive rheotaxis but with less accuracy and longer latency. the addition of discrete light cues to an otherwise dark environment disrupts rheotaxis and positioning. orientation is less accurate, latency to orient is longer, and animals do not move as far downstream in the presence of light. compared with untreated tadpoles tested in the dark, tadpoles exposed to gentamicin show less accurate rheotaxis with longer latency and do not move as far downstream in response to flow. these effects are compounded by the presence of light cues. the disruptive effects of light on flow sensing in xenopus emphasize the disturbances to natural behaviors that may be produced by anthropogenic illumination in nocturnal habitats. hair cells of the lateral line system in fish may differ in their susceptibility to damage by aminoglycoside antibiotics. gentamicin has been reported to damage hair cells within canal neuromasts, but not those within superficial neuromasts. this finding, based on sem imaging, indicates a distinction in the physiology of hair cells between the two classes of neuromast. studies concerned with the individual roles of canal and superficial neuromasts in behavior have taken advantage of this effect in an attempt to selectively disable canal neuromasts without affecting superficial neuromast function. here we present an experimental test of the hypothesis that canal neuromasts are more vulnerable to gentamicin than superficial neuromasts. we measured the effect of gentamicin exposure on hair cells using vital stains (daspei and fm1-43) in the neuromasts of mexican blind cave fish (astyanaxfasciatus) and zebrafish (daniorerio). contrary to the findings of prior studies that used sem, gentamicin significantly reduced dye uptake by hair cells of both canal and superficial neuromasts in both species. therefore, lateral line hair cells of both neuromast types are vulnerable to gentamicin ototoxicity. these findings argue for a re-evaluation of the results of studies that have used gentamicin to differentiate the roles of the two classes of neuromast in fish behavior.
phone-based unannounced pill counts to measure medication adherence are much more practical and less expensive than home-based unannounced pill counts, but their validity has not been widely assessed. we examined the validity of phone versus home-based pill counts using a simplified protocol streamlined for studies embedded in clinical care settings. a total of 100 paired counts were used to compare concordance between unannounced phone and home-based pill counts using interclass correlations. discrepancy analyses using χ2 tests compared demographic and clinical characteristics across patients who were concordant between phone and home-based pill counts and patients who were not concordant. concordance was high for phone-based and home-based unannounced total pill counts, as well as individual medication counts and calculated adherence. this study demonstrates that a simplified phone-based pill count protocol can be implemented among patients from a routine clinical care setting and is a feasible means of monitoring medication adherence.resumenlos conteos no anunciados de comprimidos por teléfono, con el propósito de medir el cumplimiento con respecto a los medicamentos, es mucho más práctico y menos costoso que los conteos no anunciados de comprimidos en el hogar, pero su validez no se ha evaluado en forma amplia. examinamos la validez de los conteos no anunciados de comprimidos en el hogar, mediante el uso de un protocolo racionalizado para estudios integrados en ambientes de atención clínica. un total de 100 conteos en pares se usaron para comparar la concordancia entre los conteos no anunciados de comprimidos por teléfono y en el hogar con correlaciones entre clases. los análisis de discrepancia mediante pruebas χ2 compararon características demográficas y clínicas en los pacientes que fueron concordantes entre los conteos de comprimidos por teléfono y en el hogar y los pacientes que no fueron concordantes. hubo una alta concordancia para los conteos no anunciados totales de comprimidos por teléfono y en el hogar, al igual que para los conteos de medicamentos individuales y para el cumplimiento calculado. este estudio demuestra que se puede implementar un protocolo simplificado de conteo de comprimidos por teléfono entre los pacientes de un entorno de atención clínica de rutina y que es un medio factible para controlar el cumplimiento con respecto a los medicamentos. objectives many questionnaires on adherence to antiretroviral therapy are in use, but the validity of patients’ responses has not been tested. the medication adherence self-report inventory (masri) has been developed and tested for its validity against objective measures and treatment outcome. design prospective study comparing questionnaire responses with mems trackcap (mc, a medication event monitoring system), pill count (pc) and plasma hiv viraemia in a publicly funded specialist hiv clinic. participants patients self-medicating antiretroviral therapy who were not cognitively impaired and were able to read and understand english. results mean adherence by mc of the 78 subjects was 92.9% (se, 1.8%) and by pc 96.8% (se, 1.4%). agreement between mc and responses to items about doses missed 1, 2 or 3 days ago was low (κ = 0.23 (p < 0.03), 0.44 (p < 0.001) and 0.28 (p < 0.01) respectively). this improved when these responses were summated (κ = 0.46;p < 0.001) and was similar to that for recall of non-adherence over the preceding 2 weeks (κ = 0.54;p < 0.001). mean self-reported adherence by visual analogue scale (vas) over the preceding month was 93.3% (se, 1.2%). this was strongly associated with both mc (r = 0.63;p < 0.001) and pc (r = 0.75;p < 0.001). on multivariate analysis, the strongest association between a masri item and mc was for the vas. both the 2 week recall and vas items were inversely associated with viral load (p = 0.01). there was no association between dose timing (measured mc or questionnaire) or 3 day self-report and viral load. conclusions the masri provides a means of measuring patient adherence that is valid when compared with objective measures.
we studied which physiological and kinanthropometric characteristics determine climbing performance in 16 high-level sports climbers aged 29.9 ± 4.9 years. body composition parameters were measured with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry scanner. we also measured kinanthropometric and physical fitness parameters. the sex-specific 75th percentile value of onsight climbing ability was used to divide the sample into expert (<75th) and elite (≥75th) climbers. all the analyses were adjusted by sex. the 75th percentile value of onsight climbing ability was 7b in women and 8b in men. there were no differences between expert and elite climbers in the studied variables, except in climbing time to exhaustion and bone mineral density. elite climbers had a significantly higher time to exhaustion than the expert group (770.2 ± 385 vs. 407.7 ± 150 s, respectively, p = 0.001). these results suggest that, among climbers with a high level of performance, as those analysed in this study, climbing time to exhaustion is a major determinant of climbing performance. objectives to assess oxygen uptake (vo2), blood lactate concentration ([la(b)]), and heart rate (hr) response during indoor and outdoor sport climbing.   methods seven climbers aged 25 (se 1) years, with a personal best ascent without preview or fall (on sight) ranging from 6b to 7a were assessed using an indoor vertical treadmill with artificial rock hand/foot holds and a discontinuous protocol with climbing velocity incremented until voluntary fatigue. on a separate occasion the subjects performed a 23.4 m outdoor rock climb graded 5c and taking 7 min 36 s (se 33 s) to complete. cardiorespiratory parameters were measured using a telemetry system and [la(b)] collected at rest and after climbing.   results indoor climbing elicited a peak oxygen uptake (vo2climb-peak) and peak hr (hrpeak) of 43.8 (se 2.2) ml/kg/min and 190 (se 4) bpm, respectively and increased blood lactate concentration [la(b)] from 1.4 (0.1) to 10.2 (0.6) mmol/l (p < 0.05). during outdoor climbing vo2 and hr increased to about 75% and 83% of vo2climb-peak and hrpeak, respectively. [la(b)] increased from 1.3 (0.1) at rest to 4.5 mmol/l (p < 0.05) at 2 min 32 s (8 s) after completion of the climb.   conclusions the results suggest that for elite climbers outdoor sport rock climbs of five to 10 minutes' duration and moderate difficulty require a significant portion of the vo2climb-peak. the higher hr and vo2 for outdoor climbing and the increased [la(b)] could be the result of repeated isometric contractions, particularly from the arm and forearm muscles.
background the combination of deworming and improved sanitation or hygiene may result in greater reductions in soil-transmitted helminth (sth) infection than any single intervention on its own. we measured sth prevalence in rural bangladesh and assessed potential interactions among deworming, hygienic latrines, and household finished floors. methodology we conducted a cross-sectional survey (n = 1,630) in 100 villages in rural bangladesh to measure three exposures: self-reported deworming consumption in the past 6 months, access to a hygienic latrine, and household flooring material. we collected stool samples from children 1–4 years, 5–12 years, and women 15–49 years. we performed mini-flotac on preserved stool samples to detect ascaris lumbricoides, enterobius vermicularis, hookworm, and trichuris trichiura ova. approximately one-third (32%) of all individuals and 40% of school-aged children had an sth infection. less than 2% of the sample had moderate/heavy intensity infections. deworming was associated with lower ascaris prevalence (adjusted prevalence ratio (pr) = 0.53; 95% ci 0.40, 0.71), but there was no significant association with hookworm (pr = 0.93, 95% ci 0.60, 1.44) or trichuris (pr = 0.90, 95% ci 0.74, 1.08). prs for hygienic latrine access were 0.91 (95% ci 0.67,1.24), 0.73 (95% ci 0.43,1.24), and 1.03 (95% ci 0.84,1.27) for ascaris, hookworm, and trichuris, respectively. finished floors were associated with lower ascaris prevalence (pr = 0.56, 95% ci 0.32, 0.97) but not associated with hookworm (pr = 0.48 95% ci 0.16,1.45) or trichuris (pr = 0.98, 95% ci 0.72,1.33). across helminths and combinations of exposures, adjusted prevalence ratios for joint exposures were consistently more protective than those for individual exposures. conclusions we found moderate sth prevalence in rural bangladesh among children and women of childbearing age. this study is one of the first to examine independent and combined associations with deworming, sanitation, and hygiene. our results suggest that coupling deworming with sanitation and flooring interventions may yield more sustained reductions in sth prevalence. abstract in this tutorial, we provide a broad introduction to the topic of interaction between the effects of exposures. we discuss interaction on both additive and multiplicative scales using risks, and we discuss their relation to statistical models (e.g. linear, log-linear, and logistic models). we discuss and evaluate arguments that have been made for using additive or multiplicative scales to assess interaction. we further discuss approaches to presenting interaction analyses, different mechanistic forms of interaction, when interaction is robust to unmeasured confounding, interaction for continuous outcomes, qualitative or “crossover” interactions, methods for attributing effects to interactions, case-only estimators of interaction, and power and sample size calculations for additive and multiplicative interaction.
background we previously showed that impulse oscillometry (ios) indices of peripheral airway function are associated with asthma control in children. however, little data exist on whether dysfunction in the peripheral airways can predict loss of asthma control.   objective we sought to determine the utility of peripheral airway impairment, as measured by ios, in predicting loss of asthma control in children.   methods fifty-four children (age, 7-17 years) with controlled asthma were enrolled in the study. spirometric and ios indices of airway function were obtained at baseline and at a follow-up visit 8 to 12 weeks later. physicians who were blinded to the ios measurements assessed asthma control (national asthma education and prevention program guidelines) on both visits and prescribed no medication change between visits.   results thirty-eight (70%) patients maintained asthma control between 2 visits (group c-c), and 16 patients had asthma that became uncontrolled on the follow-up visit (group c-uc). there was no difference in baseline spirometric results between the c-c and c-uc groups, except for fev1/forced vital capacity ratio (86% vs 82%, respectively; p < .01). baseline ios results, including resistance of the respiratory system at 5 hz (r5; 6.4 vs 4.3 cm h2o · l(-1) · s), frequency dependence of resistance (difference of r5 and resistance of the respiratory system at 20 hz [r5-20]; 2.0 vs 0.7 cm h2o · l(-1) · s), and reactance area (13.1 vs 4.1 cm h2o · l(-1)), of group c-uc were significantly higher than those of group c-c (p < .01). receiver operating characteristic analysis showed baseline r5-20 and reactance area effectively predicted asthma control status at the follow-up visit (area under the curve, 0.91 and 0.90).   conclusion children with controlled asthma who have increased peripheral airway ios indices are at risk of losing asthma control.

abstract speaker recognition (sr) under mismatched conditions is a challenging task. speech signal is nonlinear and nonstationary, and therefore, difficult to analyze under realistic conditions. also, in real conditions, the nature of the noise present in speech data is not known a priori. in such cases, the performance of speaker identification (si) or speaker verification (sv) degrades considerably under realistic conditions. any sr system uses a voice activity detector (vad) as the front-end subsystem of the whole system. the performance of most vads deteriorates at the front end of the sr task or system under degraded conditions or in realistic conditions where noise plays a major role. recently, speech data analysis and processing using norden e. huang’s empirical mode decomposition (emd) combined with hilbert transform, commonly referred to as hilbert–huang transform (hht), has become an emerging trend. emd is an a posteriori, adaptive, data analysis tool used in time domain that is widely accepted by the research community. recently, speech data analysis and speech data processing for speech recognition and sr tasks using emd have been increasing. emd-based vad has become an important adaptive subsystem of the sr system that mostly mitigates the effect of mismatch between the training and the testing phase. recently, we have developed a vad algorithm using a zero-frequency filter-assisted peaking resonator (zffpr) and emd. in this article, the efficacy of an emd-based vad algorithm is studied at the front end of a text-independent language-independent si task for the speaker’s data collected in three languages at five different places, such as home, street, laboratory, college campus, and restaurant, under realistic conditions using edirol-r09 hr, a 24-bit wav/mp3 recorder. the performance of this proposed si task is compared against the traditional energy-based vad in terms of percentage identification rate. in both cases, widely accepted mel frequency cepstral coefficients are computed by employing frame processing (20-ms frame size and 10-ms frame shift) from the extracted voiced speech regions using the respective vad techniques from the realistic speech utterances, and are used as a feature vector for speaker modeling using popular gaussian mixture models. the experimental results showed that the proposed si task with the vad algorithm using zffpr and emd at its front end performs better than the si task with short-term energy-based vad when used at its front end, and is somewhat encouraging. • speech conveys several levels of information. on a primary level, speech conveys the words or message being spoken, but on a secondary level, speech also reveals information about the speaker. the speech systems technology group at lincoln laboratory has developed and experimented with approaches for automatically recognizing the words being spoken, the language being spoken, and the topic of a conversation. in this article we present an overview of our research efforts in a fourth area-automatic speaker recognition. we base our approach on a statistical speaker-modeling technique that represents the underlying characteristic sounds of a person's voice. using these models, we build speaker recognizers that are computationally inexpensive and capable of recognizing a speaker regardless ofwhat is being said. performance of the systems is evaluated for a wide range of speech quality; from clean speech to telephone speech, by using several standard speech corpora.
employing a quasi-experimental design, this study explored the long-term effects of different childrearing ecological contexts. participants were 131 adolescents (aged 16-18) from four groups: some who lived in a city, some from a kibbutz familial setting, some from a kibbutz communal setting, and a transitional group that included adolescents raised in a communal setting as young children who moved to a familial sleeping arrangement before the age of six. adolescents' state of mind with regard to attachment and representations regarding separation were examined. participants were administered the adult attachment interview, the separation anxiety test, and background questionnaires. the group raised in a communal setting in the kibbutz showed a higher incidence of nonautonomous attachment representations and less competent coping with imagined separations than did the other groups. by contrast, the transitional group was comparable to the city and the kibbutz familial groups. these results are discussed in light of the plasticity and adaptability of children to changed circumstances. this meta-analysis on 33 studies, including more than 2,000 adult attachment interview (aai) classifications, presents distributions of aai classifications in samples of nonclinical fathers and mothers, in adolescents, in samples from different cultures, and in clinical groups. fathers, adolescents, and participants from different countries show about the same distribution of aai classifications as nonclinical mothers do. the distribution of nonclinical mothers is as follows: 24% dismissing, 58% autonomous, and 18% preoccupied mothers. about 19% of the nonclinical mothers are unresolved with respect to loss or trauma of other kinds. mothers from low socioeconomic status show more often dismissing attachment representations and unresolved loss or trauma. autonomous women and autonomous men are more often married to each other than can be expected by chance, and the same goes for unresolved men and women. clinical participants show highly deviating distributions of aai classifications, with a strong overrepresentation of insecure attachment representations, but systematic relations between clinical diagnosis and type of insecurity are absent.
this paper presents a knowledge integration framework to improve performance in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition. two types of knowledge sources, manner attribute and prosodic structure, are incorporated. for manner of articulation, six attribute detectors trained with an american english corpus (wsj0) are utilized to rescore hypothesized phones in word lattices obtained by a baseline asr system. for the prosodic structure, models trained with an unsupervised joint prosody labeling and modeling (plm) technique using wsj0 are used in lattice rescoring. experimental results on the american english wsj word recognition task of the nov92 test set show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the baseline system that does not use articulatory and prosodic information. the results also demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the plm technique in constructing prosodic models for american english asr. most statistical speech recognition systems make use of segment-level features, derived mainly from spectral envelope characteristics of the signal, but ignore supra-segmental cues that carry additional information likely to be useful for speech recognition. these cues, which constitute the prosody of the utterance and occur at the syllable, word and utterance level, are closely related to the lexical and syntactic organization of the utterance. in this paper, we explore the use of acoustic and lexical correlates of a subset of these cues in order to improve recognition performance on a read-speech corpus, using word error rate (wer) as the metric. using the features and methods described in this paper, we were able to obtain a relative wer improvement of 1.3% over a baseline asr system on the boston university radio news corpus.
the navier–stokes equations arise naturally as a result of ehrenfests’ coarse-graining in phase space after a period of free-flight dynamics. this point of view allows for a very flexible approach to the simulation of fluid flow for high-reynolds number. we construct regularisers for lattice boltzmann computational models. these regularisers are based on ehrenfests’ coarse-graining idea and could be applied to schemes with either entropic or non-entropic quasiequilibria. we give a numerical scheme which gives good results for the standard test cases of the shock tube and the flow past a square cylinder. the entropy maximum approach to constructing equilibria in lattice kinetic equations is revisited. for a suitable entropy function, we derive explicitly the hydrodynamic local equilibrium, prove the $h$ theorem for lattice bhatnagar-gross-krook models, and develop a systematic method to account for additional constraints.
segments that span contiguous parts of inputs, such as phonemes in speech, named entities in sentences, actions in videos, occur frequently in sequence prediction problems. segmental models, a class of models that explicitly hypothesizes segments, have allowed the exploration of rich segment features for sequence prediction. however, segmental models suffer from slow decoding, hampering the use of computationally expensive features.  in this thesis, we introduce discriminative segmental cascades, a multi-pass inference framework that allows us to improve accuracy by adding higher-order features and neural segmental features while maintaining efficiency. we also show that instead of including more features to obtain better accuracy, segmental cascades can be used to speed up training and decoding.  segmental models, similarly to conventional speech recognizers, are typically trained in multiple stages. in the first stage, a frame classifier is trained with manual alignments, and then in the second stage, segmental models are trained with manual alignments and the out- puts of the frame classifier. however, obtaining manual alignments are time-consuming and expensive. we explore end-to-end training for segmental models with various loss functions, and show how end-to-end training with marginal log loss can eliminate the need for detailed manual alignments.  we draw the connections between the marginal log loss and a popular end-to-end training approach called connectionist temporal classification. we present a unifying framework for various end-to-end graph search-based models, such as hidden markov models, connectionist temporal classification, and segmental models. finally, we discuss possible extensions of segmental models to large-vocabulary sequence prediction tasks. we describe the design of kaldi, a free, open-source toolkit for speech recognition research. kaldi provides a speech recognition system based on finite-state automata (using the freely available openfst), together with detailed documentation and a comprehensive set of scripts for building complete recognition systems. kaldi is written is c++, and the core library supports modeling of arbitrary phonetic-context sizes, acoustic modeling with subspace gaussian mixture models (sgmm) as well as standard gaussian mixture models, together with all commonly used linear and affine transforms. kaldi is released under the apache license v2.0, which is highly nonrestrictive, making it suitable for a wide community of users.
type ii pneumocytes, which synthesize, store, and secrete pulmonary surfactant, require exogenous fatty acids, in particular palmitic acid, for maximum surfactant synthesis. the uptake of palmitate by type ii pneumocytes is thought to be protein mediated, but the protein involved has not been characterized. here we show by rt-pcr and northern blot analysis that rat type ii pneumocytes express the mrna for fatty acid translocase (fat/cd36), a membrane-associated protein that is known to facilitate the uptake of fatty acids into adipocytes. the deduced amino acid sequence from rat type ii pneumocytes reveals 98% identity to the fat/cd36 sequence obtained from rat adipocytes. the uptake of palmitate by type ii pneumocytes follows michaelis-menten kinetics (michaelis-menten constant = 11.9 +/- 1.8 nm; maximum velocity = 62.7 +/- 5.8 pmol. min(-1). 5 x 10(5) pneumocytes(-1)) and decreases reversibly under conditions of atp depletion to 35% of control uptake. incubation of cells at 0 degrees c inhibited the uptake of palmitate almost completely, whereas depletion of potassium was without effect. preincubation of the cells with bromobimane or phloretin decreases the uptake of palmitate significantly as does preincubation with sulfo-n-succinimidyl oleate, the specific inhibitor of fat/cd36 (c. m. harmon, p. luce, a. h. beth, and n. a. abumrad. j. membr. biol. 121: 261-268, 1991). from these data, we conclude that fat/cd36 is expressed in type ii pneumocytes and mediates the uptake of palmitate in a saturable and energy-dependent manner. the data suggest that the uptake process is independent of the formation of coated pits and endocytotic vesicles. nucleic acid probes are an important tool in molecular diagnosis. to facilitate the detection of hybridized probes, they are labeled with a reporter molecule, which is usually a radioisotope. for diagnostic techniques carried out in a clinical laboratory, radioisotopes are hazardous and, thus, recently there is a move to use nonisotopic labels, such as biotin and digoxigenin. nonisotopic probes also have the advantage of much better stability over time compared with isotopic probes that have limited half-lives.
purposeglutamine is an essential amino acid for the synthesis of glutathione (gsh), the major endogenous antioxidant which protects cells from oxidative injury. to evaluate the effects of glutamine concentrations, cell growth, gsh levels, oxidative stress, and chemosensitivity were evaluated in neuroblastoma cell lines.methodsthree human neuroblastoma cell lines (sms-kcnr, sms-kanr, sms-lhn) were cultured with different concentrations of glutamine (2, 0.2 and 0 mm) under hypoxic (5% o2) or normoxic (20% o2) condition. cell proliferation and chemosensitivity were determined by mtt assay, and the levels of intracellular gsh were measured by dtnb-gssg reductase method. cellular reactive oxidative species (ros) were quantified by flow cytometry.resultsthere was a significant decrease of cell growth in low glutamine (0.2 and 0 mm) compared with control (2 mm) in all three cell lines (p < 0.01), while adding gsh partially restored the reduced cell proliferation by low glutamine. the levels of gsh in neuroblastoma cells decreased significantly in low glutamine compared with the levels of control cells cultured in 2 mm glutamine (p < 0.05), and the accumulation of cellular ros was significantly higher in 0 mm glutamine compared to the control. moreover, glutamine deprivation significantly enhanced cytotoxicity of l-pam in all three cell lines, which was abolished after addition of gsh.conclusionglutamine deprivation decreased cell proliferation and enhances cell chemosensitivity in neuroblastoma, which is presumably associated with gsh depletion. the microtiter plate technique reported by baker and colleagues for the glutathione reductase-dtnb recycling assay of total glutathione (gsx) and glutathione disulfide (gssg) has been modified according to anderson's recommendations, in order to improve the reliability and accuracy of this miniaturized method for the measurement of glutathione status in cultured/isolated cells. dilute hcl (10 mmol/l) has been used to lyse cells, before protein removal by centrifugation in the presence of 1.3% sulfosalicylic acid. the final dtnb, gssg-reductase and nadph concentrations in the reaction mixture have been increased to 0.7 mmol/l, 1.2 iu/ml and 0.24 mmol/l, respectively. the procedure specificity has been tested by spiking and dilution assays, showing that about 90% of the expected gsx amounts could actually be recovered, while no changes of gssg concentrations were caused in the cells. accuracy has been assessed by analysis of within-series precision as well as of intra- and interassay reproducibility, showing coefficient variation of <10%. glutathione changes measured either in control rat hepatocytes or in primary cultures treated with paracetamol or menadione were in good agreement with well-known literature data. these data suggest that the experimental conditions reported in this paper are suitable for the analysis of total glutathione and glutathione disulfide concentrations in cultured/isolated cells.
grids are emerging as a promising solution for resource and computation demanding applications. however, the heterogeneity of resources in grid computing, complicates resource management and scheduling of applications. in addition, the commercialization of the grid requires policies that can take into account user requirements, and budget considerations in particular. this paper considers a basic model for workflow applications modelled as directed acyclic graphs (dags) and investigates heuristics that allow to schedule the nodes of the dag (or tasks of a workflow) onto resources in a way that satisfies a budget constraint and is still optimized for overall time. two different approaches are implemented, evaluated and presented using four different types of basic dags. workflow management is emerging as an important service in grid computing. a simple model that can be used for the representation of certain workflows is a directed acyclic graph. although many heuristics have been proposed to schedule such graphs on heterogeneous environments, most of them assume accurate prediction of computation and communication costs. this limits their direct applicability to a dynamically changing environment, such as the grid. in this environment, an initial schedule may be built based on estimates, but run-time rescheduling may be needed to improve application performance. this paper presents a low-cost rescheduling policy, which considers rescheduling at a few, carefully selected points during the execution. this policy achieves performance results, which are comparable with those achieved by a policy that dynamically attempts to reschedule before the execution of every task.
background: there have been many changes in clinical trials methodology since the introduction of lithium and the beginning of the modern era of psychopharmacology in 1949. the nature and importance of these changes have not been fully addressed to date. as methodological flaws in trials can lead to false-negative or false-positive results, the objective of our study was to evaluate the impact of methodological changes in psychopharmacology clinical research over the past 60 years. methodology/principal findings: we performed a systematic review from 1949 to 2009 on medline and web of science electronic databases, and a hand search of high impact journals on studies of seven major drugs (chlorpromazine, clozapine, risperidone, lithium, fluoxetine and lamotrigine). all controlled studies published 100 months after the first trial were included. ninety-one studies met our inclusion criteria. we analyzed the major changes in abstract reporting, study design, participants’ assessment and enrollment, methodology and statistical analysis. our results showed that the methodology of psychiatric clinical trials changed substantially, with quality gains in abstract reporting, results reporting, and statistical methodology. recent trials use more informed consent, periods of washout, intention-to-treat approach and parametric tests. placebo use remains high and unchanged over time. conclusions/significance: clinical trial quality of psychopharmacological studies has changed significantly in most of the aspects we analyzed. there was significant improvement in quality reporting and internal validity. these changes have increased study efficiency; however, there is room for improvement in some aspects such as rating scales, diagnostic criteria and better trial reporting. therefore, despite the advancements observed, there are still several areas that can be improved in psychopharmacology clinical trials. citation: brunoni ar, tadini l, fregni f (2010) changes in clinical trials methodology over time: a systematic review of six decades of research in psychopharmacology. plos one 5(3): e9479. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0009479 editor: roberta w. scherer, johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health, united states of america received september 4, 2009; accepted february 11, 2010; published march 3, 2010 copyright: 2010 brunoni et al. this is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. funding: the authors have no support or funding to report. competing interests: the authors have declared that no competing interests exist. * e-mail: ffregni@bidmc.harvard.edu recently, paradigm shift from expert opinion towards evidence-based medicine has occurred encouraging physicians to base their treatment decisions on the best available research evidence. in the hierarchy of evidence randomized clinical trials (level 1 evidence) are considered of the highest quality (least biased) while non-randomized studies represent lower levels (levels 2–4). several pitfalls in the design and conduct of clinical research include: lack of randomization, lack of concealment, lack of blinding, and errors in hypothesis testing (type i and ii errors). a basic understanding of these principles of research will empower both investigators and readers when applying the results of research to clinical practice.
coordinated trafficking of intracellular vesicles is of critical importance for the maintenance of cellular health and homeostasis. members of the rab gtpase family serve as master regulators of vesicular trafficking, maturation, and fusion by reversibly associating with distinct target membranes and recruiting specific effector proteins. rabs act as molecular switches by cycling between an active, gtp-bound form and an inactive, gdp-bound form. the activity cycle is coupled to gtp hydrolysis and is tightly controlled by regulatory proteins such as guanine nucleotide exchange factors and gtpase activating proteins. rab7 specifically regulates the trafficking and maturation of vesicle populations that are involved in protein degradation including late endosomes, lysosomes, and autophagic vacuoles. missense mutations of rab7 cause a dominantly-inherited axonal degeneration known as charcot-marie-tooth type 2b (cmt2b) through an unknown mechanism. patients with cmt2b present with length-dependent degeneration of peripheral sensory and motor neurons that leads to weakness and profound sensory loss. to gain insight into the pathogenesis of cmt2b, we undertook extensive characterization of two disease-causing rab7 mutants, l129f and v162m. we present the 2.8 å crystal structure of gtp-bound l129f mutant rab7 which reveals normal conformations of the effector binding regions and catalytic site, but an alteration to the nucleotide binding pocket that is predicted to alter gtp binding. we further demonstrate that disease-associated mutations in rab7 do not lead to an intrinsic gtpase defect as previously suggested, but permit unregulated nucleotide exchange leading to both excessive activation and hydrolysis-independent inactivation. using an unbiased proteomics approach, we characterize effector interactions in wild-type and mutant rab7 and identify several novel rab7 interactors. consistent with augmented activity, mutant rab7 shows significantly enhanced interaction with a subset of effector proteins. in addition, dynamic imaging demonstrates that mutant rab7 is abnormally retained on target membranes. however, we show that increased activation of mutant rab7 is counterbalanced by unregulated, gtp-hydrolysis-independent membrane cycling. thus, we demonstrate that disease mutations uncouple rab7 from the spatial and temporal control normally imposed by regulatory proteins and cause disease by misregulation of native rab7 activity. future experiments will address the impact of rab7 misregulation on neuronal trafficking and trophic signaling. degree type dissertation degree name doctor of philosophy (phd) graduate group neuroscience first advisor j. paul taylor this dissertation is available at scholarlycommons: http://repository.upenn.edu/edissertations/145 prenylated rab gtpases occur in the cytosol in their gdp‐bound conformations bound to a cytosolic protein termed gdp‐dissociation inhibitor (gdi). rab–gdi complexes represent a pool of active, recycling rab proteins that can deliver rabs to specific and distinct membrane‐bound compartments. rab delivery to cellular membranes involves release of gdi, and the membrane‐associated rab protein then exchanges its bound gdp for gtp. we report here the identification of a novel, membrane‐associated protein factor that can release prenylated rab proteins from gdi. this gdi‐displacement factor (gdf) is not a guanine nucleotide exchange factor because it did not influence the intrinsic rates of nucleotide exchange by rabs 5, 7 or 9. rather, gdf caused the release of each of these endosomal rabs from gdi, permitting them to exchange nucleotide at their intrinsic rates. gdf displayed the greatest catalytic rate enhancement on rab9–gdi complexes. however, catalytic rate enhancement paralleled the potency of gdi in blocking nucleotide exchange: gdi was shown to be most potent in blocking nucleotide exchange by rab9. the failure of gdf to act on rab1–gdi complexes suggests that it may be specific for endosomal rab proteins. this novel, membrane‐associated activity may be part of the machinery used to localize rabs to their correct intracellular compartments.
the ability to analyze the actions which occur in a video is essential for automatic understanding of sports. action localization and recognition in videos are two main research topics in this context. in this chapter, we provide a detailed study of the prominent methods devised for these two tasks which yield superior results for sports videos. we adopt ucf sports, which is a dataset of realistic sports videos collected from broadcast television channels, as our evaluation benchmark. first, we present an overview of ucf sports along with comprehensive statistics of the techniques tested on this dataset as well as the evolution of their performance over time. to provide further details about the existing action recognition methods in this area, we decompose the action recognition framework into three main steps of feature extraction, dictionary learning to represent a video, and classification; we overview several successful techniques for each of these steps. we also overview the problem of spatio-temporal localization of actions and argue that, in general, it manifests a more challenging problem compared to action recognition. we study several recent methods for action localization which have shown promising results on sports videos. finally, we discuss a number of forward-thinking insights drawn from overviewing the action recognition and localization methods. in particular, we argue that performing the recognition on temporally untrimmed videos and attempting to describe an action, instead of conducting a forced-choice classification, are essential for analyzing the human actions in a realistic environment. k. soomro (b) center for research in computer vision, university of central florida, orlando, fl 32826, usa e-mail: ksoomro@cs.ucf.edu a.r. zamir gates computer science, #130, stanford university, 353 serra mall, stanford, ca 94305, usa e-mail: zamir@cs.stanford.edu © springer international publishing switzerland 2014 t.b. moeslund et al.

purpose fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (fecd) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder that has been primarily studied in patients of european or asian ancestry. given the sparse literature on african americans with fecd, we sought to characterize the genetic variation in three known fecd candidate genes in african american patients with fecd. methods over an 8-year period, we enrolled 47 african american probands with fecd. all participants were clinically examined with slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and when corneal tissue specimens were available, histopathologic confirmation of the clinical diagnosis was obtained. the coding regions of known fecd susceptibility genes collagen, type viii, alpha 2 (col8a2); solute carrier family 4, sodium borate transporter, member 11 (slc4a11); and zinc finger e-box binding homeobox 1 (zeb1 [also known as tcf8]) were sanger sequenced in the 47 probands using dna isolated from blood samples. results twenty-two coding variants were detected across the col8a2, slc4a11, and zeb1 genes; six were nonsynonymous variants. three novel coding variants were detected: a synonymous variant each in col8a2 and slc4a11 and one nonsynonymous variant in zeb1 (p.p559s), which is predicted to be benign and tolerated, thus making its physiologic consequence uncertain. conclusions variation in the col8a2, slc4a11, and zeb1 genes is present in only a small fraction of our african american cases and as such does not appear to significantly contribute to the genetic risk of fecd in african americans. this observation is on par with findings from previous sequencing studies involving european or asian ancestry patients with fecd. fuchs corneal dystrophy (fcd) is a degenerative genetic disorder of the corneal endothelium that represents one of the most common causes of corneal transplantation in the united states. despite its high prevalence (4% over the age of 40), the underlying genetic basis of fcd is largely unknown. here we report missense mutations in tcf8, a transcription factor whose haploinsufficiency causes posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (ppcd), in a cohort of late-onset fcd patients. in contrast to ppcd-causing mutations, all of which are null, fcd-associated mutations encode rare missense changes suggested to cause loss of function by an in vivo complementation assay. importantly, segregation of a recurring p.q840p mutation in a large, multigenerational fcd pedigree showed this allele to be sufficient but not necessary for pathogenesis. execution of a genome-wide scan conditioned for the presence of the 840p allele identified an additional late-onset fcd locus on chromosome 9p, whereas haplotype analysis indicated that the presence of the tcf8 allele and the disease haplotype on 9p leads to a severe fcd manifestation with poor prognosis. our data suggest that ppcd and fcd are allelic variants of the same disease continuum and that genetic interaction between genes that cause corneal dystrophies can modulate the expressivity of the phenotype.
community question answering (cqa) forums have become a popular medium for soliciting direct answers to specific questions of users from experts or other experienced users on a given topic. however, for a given question, users sometimes have to sift through a large number of low-quality or irrelevant answers to find out the answer which satisfies their information need. to alleviate this, the problem of answer quality prediction (aqp) aims to predict the quality of an answer posted in response to a forum question. current aqp systems either learn models using - a) various hand-crafted features (hcf) or b) use deep learning (dl) techniques which automatically learn the required feature representations.  in this paper, we propose a novel approach for aqp known as - "deep feature fusion network (dffn)" which leverages the advantages of both hand-crafted features and deep learning based systems. given a question-answer pair along with its metadata, dffn independently - a) learns deep features using a convolutional neural network (cnn) and b) computes hand-crafted features using various external resources and then combines them using a deep neural network trained to predict the final answer quality. dffn achieves state-of-the-art performance on the standard semeval-2015 and semeval-2016 benchmark datasets and outperforms baseline approaches which individually employ either hcf or dl based techniques alone. we describe semeval–2017 task 3 on community question answering. this year, we reran the four subtasks from semeval-2016: (a) question–comment similarity, (b) question–question similarity, (c) question–external comment similarity, and (d) rerank the correct answers for a new question in arabic, providing all the data from 2015 and 2016 for training, and fresh data for testing. additionally, we added a new subtask e in order to enable experimentation with multi-domain question duplicate detection in a larger-scale scenario, using stackexchange subforums. a total of 23 teams participated in the task, and submitted a total of 85 runs (36 primary and 49 contrastive) for subtasks a–d. unfortunately, no teams participated in subtask e. a variety of approaches and features were used by the participating systems to address the different subtasks. the best systems achieved an official score (map) of 88.43, 47.22, 15.46, and 61.16 in subtasks a, b, c, and d, respectively. these scores are better than the baselines, especially for subtasks a–c.
complex events consist of various human interactions with different objects in diverse environments. the evidences needed to recognize events may occur in short time periods with variable lengths and can happen anywhere in a video. this fact prevents conventional machine learning algorithms from effectively recognizing the events. in this paper, we propose a novel method that can automatically identify the key evidences in videos for detecting complex events. both static instances (objects) and dynamic instances (actions) are considered by sampling frames and temporal segments respectively. to compare the characteristic power of heterogeneous instances, we embed static and dynamic instances into a multiple instance learning framework via instance similarity measures, and cast the problem as an evidence selective ranking (esr) process. we impose l1 norm to select key evidences while using the infinite push loss function to enforce positive videos to have higher detection scores than negative videos. the alternating direction method of multipliers (admm) algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem. experiments on large-scale video datasets show that our method can improve the detection accuracy while providing the unique capability in discovering key evidences of each complex event. this paper presents an approach to automatically optimizing the retrieval quality of search engines using clickthrough data. intuitively, a good information retrieval system should present relevant documents high in the ranking, with less relevant documents following below. while previous approaches to learning retrieval functions from examples exist, they typically require training data generated from relevance judgments by experts. this makes them difficult and expensive to apply. the goal of this paper is to develop a method that utilizes clickthrough data for training, namely the query-log of the search engine in connection with the log of links the users clicked on in the presented ranking. such clickthrough data is available in abundance and can be recorded at very low cost. taking a support vector machine (svm) approach, this paper presents a method for learning retrieval functions. from a theoretical perspective, this method is shown to be well-founded in a risk minimization framework. furthermore, it is shown to be feasible even for large sets of queries and features. the theoretical results are verified in a controlled experiment. it shows that the method can effectively adapt the retrieval function of a meta-search engine to a particular group of users, outperforming google in terms of retrieval quality after only a couple of hundred training examples.
purpose walking is purported to reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation by 48%, whereas jogging is purported to increase its risk by 53%, suggesting a strong anti-arrhythmic benefit of walking over running. the purpose of these analyses is to compare incident self-reported physician-diagnosed cardiac arrhythmia to baseline energy expenditure (metabolic equivalent hours per day, methr/d) from walking, running and other exercise. methods proportional hazards analysis of 14,734 walkers and 32,073 runners. results there were 1,060 incident cardiac arrhythmias (412 walkers, 648 runners) during 6.2 years of follow-up. the risk for incident cardiac arrhythmias declined 4.4% per baseline methr/d walked by the walkers, or running in the runners (p = 0.0001). specifically, the risk declined 14.2% (hazard ratio: 0.858) for 1.8 to 3.6 methr/d, 26.5% for 3.6 to 5.4 methr/d, and 31.7% for ≥5.4 methr/d, relative to <1.8 methr/d. the risk reduction per methr/d was significantly greater for walking than running (p<0.01), but only because walkers were at 34% greater risk than runners who fell below contemporary physical activity guideline recommendations; otherwise the walkers and runners had similar risks for cardiac arrhythmias. cardiac arrhythmias were unrelated to walking and running intensity, and unrelated to marathon participation and performance. conclusions the risk for cardiac arrhythmias was similar in walkers and runners who expended comparable methr/d during structured exercise. we found no significant risk increase for self-reported cardiac arrhythmias associated with running distance, exercise intensity, or marathon participation. rhythm abnormalities were based on self-report, precluding definitive categorization of the nature of the rhythm disturbance. however, even if the runners’ arrhythmias include sinus bradycardia due to running itself, there was no increase in arrhythmias with greater running distance. we provide an updated version of the compendium of physical activities, a coding scheme that classifies specific physical activity (pa) by rate of energy expenditure. it was developed to enhance the comparability of results across studies using self-reports of pa. the compendium coding scheme links a five-digit code that describes physical activities by major headings (e.g., occupation, transportation, etc.) and specific activities within each major heading with its intensity, defined as the ratio of work metabolic rate to a standard resting metabolic rate (met). energy expenditure in met-minutes, met-hours, kcal, or kcal per kilogram body weight can be estimated for specific activities by type or met intensity. additions to the compendium were obtained from studies describing daily pa patterns of adults and studies measuring the energy cost of specific physical activities in field settings. the updated version includes two new major headings of volunteer and religious activities, extends the number of specific activities from 477 to 605, and provides updated met intensity levels for selected activities.
the concept of an agent is increasingly used in contemporary software applications, particularly those involving the internet, autonomous systems, or cooperation. however, with dependability and safety in mind, it is vital that the mechanisms for representing and implementing agents are clear and consistent. hence there has been a strong research effort directed at using formal logic as the basis for agent descriptions and agent implementation. such a logical basis not only presents the clarity and consistency required but also allows for important techniques such as logical verification to be applied. we present a road map of research into the use of computational logic in agent‐based systems and survey much of the recent work in these areas. even though, with such a rapidly changing field, it is impossible to cover every development, we aim to give the reader sufficient background to understand the current research problems and potential future developments in this maturing area. this paper presents an argumentation based framework to support the decision making of an agent within a modular architecture for agents. the proposed argumentation framework is dynamic, with arguments and their strength depending on the particular context that the agent finds himself, thus allowing the agent to adapt his decisions in a changing environment. in addition, in order to enable the agent to operate within an open environment where the available information may be incomplete we have integrated abduction within this argumentation framework. this is particular useful when the agent finds himself in a dilemma and hence needs additional information to resolve this. we have also developed, motivated by work in cognitive psychology, within the same framework an argumentation based personality theory for agents thus incorporating a dimension of individuality in the decisions of the agent.
the sustainability of e-government implementation and use involve many actors. however, limited studies have addressed how actors play a role in the sustainability of e-government implementation and use in particular at local government level. this study uses social actor theory from lamb & kling [1] to explore the role actors play in the sustainability of e-government within two regencies in indonesia. social actor theory posits that the social actors play various roles to produce goods and services through interactions with other actors in various contexts both internal and external organizations. our findings show that e-government implementation and use within local government was sustained by social actors that play roles across four dimensions, affiliation, environment, interaction, and identity. our study contributes to better understanding of how social actors across internal local government hierarchies (users and implementers in the regency office, districts, and villages) and external local government (e.g. central government institutions, vendors, and citizens) play roles in sustaining e-government. the problem and the solution. this chapter overviews case study research and proposes a manner in which case study research can contribute to theory building in applied disciplines. although theory building using case study research has been discussed previously in the literature, there is no clarity as to how case study research can be used to build theory. moreover, it should not be assumed that there is clarity on the processes of case writing, case studies, or case study research. this chapter presents definitions, purposes, and elements of case study research for the purpose of understanding how case study research can be used to build theory in applied disciplines.
this paper reports findings from an ahrc-funded project into the use of more than one language in research projects. using 35 seminar presentations and 25 researcher profiles, we investigated how researchers from differing disciplines became aware of the possibilities, complexities, and emerging practices of researching where more than one language is used: for example, in initial research design, literature reviews, consent procedures, data generation and analysis, and reporting. our analysis also revealed some of the challenges that researchers face regarding institutional policies, language choices, interpretation and translation practices, and the language politics of representation and dissemination. based on this analysis, we argue that researchers need to account for the research spaces and the relationships these spaces engender, and recognise developing researcher awareness when researching multilingually. thematic analysis is a poorly demarcated, rarely acknowledged, yet widely used qualitative analytic method within psychology. in this paper, we argue that it offers an accessible and theoretically flexible approach to analysing qualitative data. we outline what thematic analysis is, locating it in relation to other qualitative analytic methods that search for themes or patterns, and in relation to different epistemological and ontological positions. we then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start thematic analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis. finally, we outline the disadvantages and advantages of thematic analysis. we conclude by advocating thematic analysis as a useful and flexible method for qualitative research in and beyond psychology.
indole-3-acetic acid (iaa) conjugation is an integral component of a sensitive mechanism for the regulation of free auxin level in the cell, in addition to hormone synthesis, degradation and transport. one mechanism of regulating both the level and biological activity of hormone involves the conjugation of iaa to amino acids through iaa–amido synthetases. these enzymes belong to the family of gh3 proteins encoded by early-auxin responsive genes, which are conserved in monocots and dicots. in this investigation, we identified pea iaa–asp synthetase as a member of the gh3 family proteins based on amino acid sequence determined by tandem mass spectrometry (lc–ms/ms). iaa–asp synthetase was highly homologous (54–84 % amino acid identity) to the gh3 proteins from populus trichocarpa, glycine max, riccinus communis, nicotiana tabacum, and arabidopsis thaliana. moreover, we studied the subcellular distribution and activity of iaa amido synthetase in developing pea seedlings. the cytoplasmic localization of gh3 iaa amido synthetase was indicated in 12-day-old pea seedlings by immunofluorescence method using anti-atgh3.5 antibodies. this finding was confirmed by the measurement of the enzyme activity in the subcellular fractions collected by differential centrifugation. the most of iaa–asp synthetase activity (88 % of the total activity) was detected in the 100,000×g supernatant fluid fraction containing soluble cytoplasmic proteins. 3- and 6-day-old pea seedlings showed a weak iaa–asp synthetase activity and gh3 mrna level. twelve-day-old pea stems exhibited 19-fold, and 4-fold higher levels of transcript and the enzyme activity, respectively than 3-day-old plants. we hypothesized that iaa–amido synthetase expression and activity depend on developmental stage of vegetative tissues and this is associated with changes in free iaa level. auxins are hormones involved in many cellular, physiological and developmental processes in seed plants and in mosses such as physcomitrella patens. control of auxin levels is achieved in higher plants via synthesis of auxin conjugates by members of the gh3 family. the role of the two gh3-like proteins from p. patens for growth and auxin homeostasis was therefore analysed. the in vivo-function of the two p. patens gh3 genes was investigated using single and double knockout mutants. the two p. patens gh3 proteins were also heterologously expressed to determine their enzymatic activity. both p. patens gh3 enzymes accepted the auxin indole acetic acid (iaa) as substrate, but with different preferences for the amino acid to which it is attached. cytoplasmic localization was shown for ppgh3-1 tagged with green fluorescent protein (gfp). targeted knock-out of either gene exhibited an increased sensitivity to auxin, resulting in growth inhibition. on plain mineral media mutants had higher levels of free iaa and less conjugated iaa than the wild type, and this effect was enhanced when auxin was supplied. the deltappgh3-1/deltappgh3-2 double knockout had almost no iaa amide conjugates but still synthesized ester conjugates. taken together, these data suggest a developmentally controlled involvement of p. patens gh3 proteins in auxin homeostasis by conjugating excess of physiologically active free auxin to inactive iaa-amide conjugates.
treatment of cutaneous and subcutaneous tumors with electrochemotherapy has become a regular clinical method, while treatment of deep-seated tumors is still at an early stage of development. we present a method for preparing a dedicated patient-specific, computer-optimized treatment plan for electrochemotherapy of deep-seated tumors based on medical images. the treatment plan takes into account the patient’s anatomy, tissue conductivity changes during electroporation and the constraints of the pulse generator. analysis of the robustness of a treatment plan made with this method shows that the effectiveness of the treatment is not affected significantly by small single errors in electrode positioning. however, when many errors occur simultaneously, the resulting drop in effectiveness is larger, which means that it is necessary to be as accurate as possible in electrode positioning. the largest effect on treatment effectiveness stems from uncertainties in dielectric properties and electroporation thresholds of treated tumors and surrounding tissues, which emphasizes the need for more accurate measurements and more research. the presented methods for treatment planning and robustness analysis allow quantification of the treatment reproducibility and enable the setting of suitable safety margins to improve the likelihood of successful treatment of deep-seated tumors by electrochemotherapy. irreversible electroporation (ire) is a new tissue ablation technique in which micro to millisecond electrical pulses are delivered to undesirable tissue to produce cell necrosis through irreversible cell membrane permeabilization. ire affects only the cell membrane and no other structure in the tissue. the goal of the study is to test our ire tissue ablation methodology in the pig liver, provide first experience results on long term histopathology of ire ablated tissue, and discuss the clinical implications of the findings. the study consists of: a) designing an ire ablation protocol through a mathematical analysis of the electrical field during electroporation; b) using ultrasound to position the electroporation electrodes in the predetermined locations and subsequently to monitor the process; c) applying the predetermined electrotroporation pulses; d) performing histolopathology on the treated samples for up to two weeks after the procedure; and e) correlating the mathematical analysis, ultrasound data, and histology. we observed that electroporation affects tissue in a way that can be imaged in real time with ultrasound, which should facilitate real time control of electroporation during clinical applications. we observed cell ablation to the margin of the treated lesion with several cells thickness resolution. there appears to be complete ablation to the margin of blood vessels without compromising the functionality of the blood vessels, which suggests that ire is a promising method for treatment of tumors near blood vessels (a significant challenge with current ablation methods). consistent with the mechanism of action of ire on the cell membrane only, we show that the structure of bile ducts, blood vessels, and connective tissues remains intact with ire. we report extremely rapid resolution of lesions, within two weeks, which is consistent with retention of vasculature. we also document tentative evidence for an immunological response to the ablated tissue. last, we show that mathematical predictions with the laplace equation can be used in treatment planning. the ire tissue ablation technique, as characterized in this report, may become an important new tool in the surgeon armamentarium.
of the dissertation facial expression recognition and expression intensity estimation by peng yang dissertation director: professor dimitris n. metaxas seventy years ago, psychologist categorized the facial expression into seven categories: angry, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise and neutral. through analyzing the expression, psychologists want to predict the emotions behind the expression. due to all kinds of potential applications on human emotion analysis, automatical analysis of human affective expressions has attracted increasing attention from researchers in psychology, computer science, linguistics, neuroscience, and related disciplines. researchers have done lots of works on this topic in the past thirty years, and proposed lots of promising approaches. although many works have been done on this topic, these existing methods typically handle deliberately displayed and exaggerated expression of prototypical emotions. there are still some hard problems not solved well for the real system to handle naturally occurring emotions such as exploring discriminative features, time wrapping, and expression intensity estimation. our work focuses on these real problems, analyzes the challenges in the real system and proposes the sounded solutions for advancing human affect sensing technology. within the past decade, significant effort has occurred in developing methods of facial expression analysis. because most investigators have used relatively limited data sets, the generalizability of these various methods remains unknown. we describe the problem space for facial expression analysis, which includes level of description, transitions among expressions, eliciting conditions, reliability and validity of training and test data, individual differences in subjects, head orientation and scene complexity image characteristics, and relation to non-verbal behavior. we then present the cmu-pittsburgh au-coded face expression image database, which currently includes 2105 digitized image sequences from 182 adult subjects of varying ethnicity, performing multiple tokens of most primary facs action units. this database is the most comprehensive testbed to date for comparative studies of facial expression analysis.
targeted molecular dynamics simulations were used to study the conformational transition of influenza hemagglutinin (ha) from the native conformation to putative fusogenic or postfusion conformations populated at low ph. three pathways for this conformational change were considered. complete dissociation of the globular domains of ha was observed in one pathway, whereas smaller rearrangements were observed in the other two. the fusion peptides became exposed and moved toward the target membrane, although occasional movement toward the viral membrane was also observed. the effective energy profiles along the paths show multiple barriers. the final low-ph structures, which are consistent with available experimental data, are comparable in effective energy to native ha. as a control, the uncleaved precursor ha0 was also forced along the same pathway. in this case both the final energy and the energy barrier were much higher than in the cleaved protein. this study suggests that 1) as proposed, the native conformation is the global minimum energy conformation for the uncleaved precursor but a metastable state for cleaved ha; 2) the spring-loaded conformational change is energetically plausible in full-length ha; and 3) complete globular domain dissociation is not necessary for extension of the coiled coil and fusion peptide exposure, but the model with complete dissociation has lower energy. viral envelope glycoproteins promote viral infection by mediating the fusion of the viral membrane with the host-cell membrane. structural and biochemical studies of two viral glycoproteins, influenza hemagglutinin and hiv-1 envelope protein, have led to a common model for viral entry. the fusion mechanism involves a transient conformational species that can be targeted by therapeutic strategies. this mechanism of infectivity is likely utilized by a wide variety of enveloped viruses for which similar therapeutic interventions should be possible.
adaptation to a given face leads to face-related, specific after-effects. recently, this topic has attracted a lot of attention because it clearly shows that adaptation occurs even at the higher stages of visual cortical processing. however, during our every-day life, faces do not appear in isolation, rather they are usually surrounded by other stimuli. here, we used psychophysical and fmri adaptation methods to test whether humans adapt to the gender properties of a composite multiple face stimulus as well. as adaptors we used stimuli composed of eight different individual faces, positioned peripherally in a ring around a fixation mark. we found that the gender discrimination of a subsequent centrally presented target face is significantly biased as a result of long-term adaptation to either male or female multiple face stimuli. similar to our previous results with single-face adaptors (kovács et al. in neuroimage 43(1):156–164, 2008), a concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation experiment revealed the strongest blood oxygen level–dependent signal adaptation bilaterally in the fusiform face area. our results suggest that humans extract the statistical features of the multiple face stimulus and this process occurs at the level of occipito-temporal face processing. the psychometric function relates an observer’s performance to an independent variable, usually some physical quantity of a stimulus in a psychophysical task. this paper, together with its companion paper (wichmann & hill, 2001), describes an integrated approach to (1) fitting psychometric functions, (2) assessing the goodness of fit, and (3) providing confidence intervals for the function’s parameters and other estimates derived from them, for the purposes of hypothesis testing. the present paper deals with the first two topics, describing a constrained maximum-likelihood method of parameter estimation and developing several goodness-of-fit tests. using monte carlo simulations, we deal with two specific difficulties that arise when fitting functions to psychophysical data. first, we note that human observers are prone to stimulus-independent errors (orlapses). we show that failure to account for this can lead to serious biases in estimates of the psychometric function’s parameters and illustrate how the problem may be overcome. second, we note that psychophysical data sets are usually rather small by the standards required by most of the commonly applied statistical tests. we demonstrate the potential errors of applying traditionalx2 methods to psychophysical data and advocate use of monte carlo resampling techniques that do not rely on asymptotic theory. we have made available the software to implement our methods.
analysis of fecal glucocorticoid (gc) metabolites has recently become the standard method to monitor adrenocortical activity in primates noninvasively. however, given variation in the production, metabolism, and excretion of gcs across species and even between sexes, there are no standard methods that are universally applicable. in particular, it is important to validate assays intended to measure gc production, test extraction and storage procedures, and consider the time course of gc metabolite excretion relative to the production and circulation of the native hormones. this study examines these four methodological aspects of fecal gc metabolite analysis in tufted capuchins (cebus apella). specifically, we conducted an adrenocorticotrophic hormone (acth) challenge on one male and one female capuchin to test the validity of four gc enzyme immunoassays (eias) and document the time course characterizing gc metabolite excretion in this species. in addition, we compare a common field-friendly technique for extracting fecal gc metabolites to an established laboratory extraction methodology and test for effects of storing “field extracts” for up to 1 yr. results suggest that a corticosterone eia is most sensitive to changes in gc production, provides reliable measures when extracted according to the field method, and measures gc metabolites which remain highly stable after even 12 mo of storage. further, the time course of gc metabolite excretion is shorter than that described yet for any primate taxa. these results provide guidelines for studies of gcs in tufted capuchins, and underscore the importance of validating methods for fecal hormone analysis for each species of interest. 1. the measurement of steroid hormone metabolites from faeces in wild animal populations is a powerful, noninvasive tool in behavioural endocrinology of all major vertebrate taxa. however, because such research is often done in remote areas with limited infrastructure, storage of samples for hormone analysis over long periods at high temperature is a critical issue in field endocrinology. previous studies have indicated that storage of alcoholic faecal extracts is more reliable than storage of unprocessed faeces if no freezer is available, but a standardmethod has not been established yet. 2. we tested the validity of three commonly applied storage conditions – liquid extracts, dried extracts and extracts placed on solid-phase extraction (spe) cartridges – to preserve concentrations of glucocorticoid and androgenmetabolites from faecal extracts of olive baboons (papio anubis) at high temperature over 1 year. 3. temporal variation in concentrations was detected for all metabolites and all storage conditions, including values measured from the control condition, that is, extracts stored at 20°c. this suggested that most variation was due to interassay variability, corroborated by comparisons of variation in ‘quality controls’ and samples. 4. compared to frozen control samples, liquid extracts were stable for up to 24 weeks, extracts on spe cartridges were stable for up to 50 weeks, while steroidmetabolite concentrations in dried extracts decreased slightly over time. 5. if steroid samples have to be stored at ambient temperature, we suggest storage of liquid extracts for up to 24 weeks in a dark and cool place. for longer periods, spe cartridges should be applied as evaporation, a potential confound arising with long-term storage of liquid extracts at higher temperatures, is not a problem in this storage condition. storage of dried extracts is more cost-effective, but may result in small time-dependent changes in steroid concentrations.
the analysis of real mobile traffic traces is helpful to understand usage patterns of cellular networks. in particular, mobile data may be used for network optimization and management in terms of radio resources, network planning, energy saving, for instance. however, real network data from the operators is often difficult to be accessed, due to legal and privacy issues. in this paper, we overcome the lack of network information using a lte sniffer capable of decoding the unencrypted lte control channel and we present a temporal and spatial analysis of the recorded traces. moreover, we present a methodology to derive a stochastic characterization for the daily variation of the lte traffic. the proposed model is based on a discrete-time markov chain and is compared with the real traces. results show that, with a limited number of states, our model presents a high level of accuracy in terms of first and second order statistics. reliable network measurements are a fundamental component of networking research as they enable network analysis, system debugging, performance evaluation and optimization. in particular, decoding the lte control channel would give access to the full base station traffic at a 1 ms granularity, thus allowing for traffic profiling and accurate measurements. although a few open-source implementations of lte are available, they do not provide tools to reliably decoding the lte control channel and, thus, accessing the scheduling information. in this paper, we present owl, an online watcher for lte that is able to decode all the resource blocks in more than 99% of the system frames, significantly outperforming existing non-commercial prior decoders. compared to previous attempts, owl grounds the decoding procedure on information obtained from the lte random access mechanism. this makes it possible to run our software on inexpensive hardware coupled with almost any software defined radio capable of sampling the lte signal with sufficient accuracy.
increased activation of specific protein kinase c (pkc) isoforms and increased nonenzymatic glycation of intracellular and extracellular proteins [the accumulation of advanced glycation end products (ages)] are major mechanistic pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications. blocking pkc-beta(ii) has been shown to decrease albuminuria in animal models of diabetes. to demonstrate a direct relationship between ages and the induction and translocation of pkc-beta(ii), studies were carried out in rat neonatal mesangial cells, known to express pkc-beta(ii) in association with rapid proliferation in post-natal development. oxidative stress was studied by using the fluorescent probe dichlorfluorescein diacetate. translocation of pkc-beta(ii) was demonstrated by using immunofluorescence and western blotting of fractionated mesangial cells. induction of intracellular oxidative stress, increase in intracellular calcium, and cytosol to membrane pkc-beta(ii) translocation (with no change in pkc-alpha) were demonstrated after exposure to age-rich proteins. these data support the hypothesis that ages cause mesangial oxidative stress and alterations in pkc-beta(ii), changes that may ultimately contribute to phenotypic abnormalities associated with diabetic nephropathy. the use of flow cytometric techniques has significantly aided the rapid advancement of our understanding of the process of apoptosis. our laboratory is currently involved in investigating the ways in which cells can be induced to die and some of the signals that may be involved. to this end, we are using flow cytometry to detect apoptosis in cell cultures and to measure intracellular changes that occur during apoptosis, in particular, alterations in parameters such as mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and gene expression. in this review of recent and ongoing research in our laboratory, we outline our studies on mechanisms of apoptosis by cytotoxic drugs, particularly in relation to the involvement of oxidative stress. in addition, we are studying the increased sensitivity to apoptosis seen in k652 cells that have been transfected with the p53 gene.
the hippocampal region, comprising the hippocampal formation and the parahippocampal region, has been one of the most intensively studied parts of the brain for decades. better understanding of its functional diversity and complexity has led to an increased demand for specificity in experimental procedures and manipulations. in view of the complex 3d structure of the hippocampal region, precisely positioned experimental approaches require a fine‐grained architectural description that is available and readable to experimentalists lacking detailed anatomical experience. in this paper, we provide the first cyto‐ and chemoarchitectural description of the hippocampal formation and parahippocampal region in the rat at high resolution and in the three standard sectional planes: coronal, horizontal and sagittal. the atlas uses a series of adjacent sections stained for neurons and for a number of chemical marker substances, particularly parvalbumin and calbindin. all the borders defined in one plane have been cross‐checked against their counterparts in the other two planes. the entire dataset will be made available as a web‐based interactive application through the rodent brain workbench (http://www.rbwb.org) which, together with this paper, provides a unique atlas resource. © 2014 wiley periodicals, inc. we studied the distribution and coexpression of vesicular glutamate transporters (vglut1, vglut2), glutamic acid decarboxylase (gad) and calretinin (cr, calcium-binding protein) in rat entorhinal cortex, using immunofluorescence staining and multichannel confocal laser scanning microscopy. images were computer processed and subjected to automated 3d object recognition, colocalization analysis and 3d reconstruction. since the vgluts (in contrast to cr and gad) occurred in fibers and axon terminals only, we focused our attention on these neuronal processes. an intense, punctate vglut1-staining occurred everywhere in the entorhinal cortex. our computer program resolved these punctae as small 3d objects. also vglut2 showed a punctate immunostaining pattern, yet with half the number of 3d objects per tissue volume compared with vglut1, and with statistically significantly larger 3d objects. both vgluts were distributed homogeneously across cortical layers, with in mea vglut1 slightly more densely distributed than in lea. the distribution pattern and the size distribution of gad 3d objects resembled that of vglut2. cr-immunopositive fibers were abundant in all cortical layers. in double-stained sections we noted ample colocalization of cr and vglut2, whereas coexpression of cr and vglut1 was nearly absent. also in triple-staining experiments (vglut2, gad and cr combined) we noted coexpression of vglut2 and cr and, in addition, frequent coexpression of gad and cr. modest colocalization occurred of vglut2 and gad, and incidental colocalization of all three markers. we conclude that the cr-containing axon terminals in the entorhinal cortex belong to at least two subpopulations of cr-neurons: a glutamatergic excitatory and a gabaergic inhibitory.
many human behaviors, from mating to food acquisition and aggressiveness, entail some degree of risk. testosterone, a steroid hormone, has been implicated in a wide range of such behaviors in men. however, little is known about the specific relationship between testosterone and risk preferences. in this article, we explore the relationship between prenatal and pubertal testosterone exposure, current testosterone, and financial risk preferences in men. using a sample of 98 men, we find that risk-taking in an investment game with potential for real monetary payoffs correlates positively with salivary testosterone levels and facial masculinity, with the latter being a proxy of pubertal hormone exposure. 2d:4d, which has been proposed as a proxy for prenatal hormone exposure, did not correlate significantly with risk preferences. although this is a study of association, the results may shed light on biological determinants of risk preferences. we hypothesized from the parasite theory of sexual selection that men (homo sapiens) would prefer averageness and symmetry in women's faces, that women would prefer averageness and symmetry in men's faces, and that women would prefer largeness (not averageness) of the secondary sexual traits of men's faces. we generated computer images of men's and women's faces and of composites of the faces of each sex, and then had men and women rate opposite-sex faces for 4 variables (attractive, dominant, sexy, and healthy). symmetry, averageness, and the sizes of facial features were measured on the computerized faces. the hypotheses were supported, with the exception of the hypothesized effects of averageness of female and male faces on attractiveness ratings. this is the first study to show that facial symmetry has a positive influence on facial attractiveness ratings.
backgroundhigh total cholesterol and low hdl (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol are important determinants of cardiovascular disease. little is known about dyslipidemia among turkish and moroccan migrants, two of the largest ethnic minority groups in several european countries. this study examines ethnic differences in total and hdl cholesterol levels between dutch, turkish and moroccan ethnic groups.methodsdata were collected in the setting of a general health survey, in amsterdam, the netherlands, in 2004. total response rate was 45% (dutch: 46%, turks: 50%, moroccans: 39%). from 1,220 adults information on history of hypercholesterolemia, lifestyle and demographic background was obtained via health interviews. in a physical examination measurements of anthropometry and blood pressure were performed and blood was collected. total and hdl cholesterol were determined in serum.resultstotal cholesterol levels were lower and hypercholesterolemia was less prevalent among the moroccan and turkish than the dutch ethnic population. hdl cholesterol was also relatively low among these migrant groups. the resulting total/hdl cholesterol ratio was particularly unfavourable among the turkish ethnic group. controlling for body mass index and alcohol abstinence substantially attenuated ethnic differences in hdl cholesterol levels and total/hdl cholesterol ratio.conclusionstotal cholesterol levels are relatively low in turkish and moroccan migrants. however part of this advantage is off-set by their relatively low levels of hdl cholesterol, resulting in an unfavourable total/hdl cholesterol ratio, particularly in the turkish population. important factors in explaining ethnic differences are the relatively high body mass index and level of alcohol abstinence in these migrant groups. background ethnic minorities living in western societies may have a higher prevalence of diabetes. we investigated whether the prevalence of diabetes among turkish and moroccan migrants differs from the indigenous urban population in the netherlands, and whether these differences can be explained by differences in risk factors.   methods in 2004 a general health survey, stratified by ethnicity and age, was carried out among the population of amsterdam. the current study included 375 turkish, 314 moroccan and 417 dutch individuals aged 18-70 years. participants underwent a physical examination and a health interview. diabetes was based on self-report, the use of anti-diabetic medicine, blood glucose levels and hba1c.   results the prevalence of diabetes in the amsterdam population was significantly higher in turkish (5.6%) and moroccan (8.0%), compared to dutch individuals (3.1%). these differences, which were much larger after adjustment for age, were only partly explained by the lower socioeconomic status and higher frequency of obesity among ethnic minorities. the difference between dutch and moroccan individuals remained significant even after adjustments for multiple risk factors. the typical age of onset of diabetes in both turks and moroccans is respectively one and two decades younger than in the indigenous population.   conclusion diabetes is more prevalent among turkish and moroccan migrants as compared to the indigenous population. only part of this difference can be explained by differences in demographic and lifestyle risk factors.
nitric oxide (no) and prostaglandins (pg) together play a role in regulating blood flow during exercise. no also regulates mitochondrial oxygen consumption through competitive binding to cytochrome-c oxidase. indomethacin uncouples and inhibits the electron transport chain in a concentration-dependent manner, and thus, inhibition of no and pg synthesis may regulate both muscle oxygen delivery and utilization. the purpose of this study was to examine the independent and combined effects of no and pg synthesis blockade (l-nmma and indomethacin, respectively) on mitochondrial respiration in human muscle following knee extension exercise (kee). specifically, this study examined the physiological effect of no, and the pharmacological effect of indomethacin, on muscle mitochondrial function. consistent with their mechanism of action, we hypothesized that inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (nos) and pg synthesis would have opposite effects on muscle mitochondrial respiration. mitochondrial respiration was measured ex vivo by high-resolution respirometry in saponin-permeabilized fibers following 6 min kee in control (con; n = 8), arterial infusion of n(g)-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-nmma; n = 4) and indo (n = 4) followed by combined inhibition of nos and pg synthesis (l-nmma + indo, n = 8). adp-stimulated state 3 respiration (oxphos) with substrates for complex i (glutamate, malate) was reduced 50% by indo. state 3 o(2) flux with complex i and ii substrates was reduced less with both indo (20%) and l-nmma + indo (15%) compared with con. the results indicate that indomethacin reduces state 3 mitochondrial respiration primarily at complex i of the respiratory chain, while blockade of nos by l-nmma counteracts the inhibition by indo. this effect on muscle mitochondria, in concert with a reduction of blood flow accounts for in vivo changes in muscle o(2) consumption during combined blockade of nos and pg synthesis. prostaglandins, nitric oxide (no) and endothelial‐derived hyperpolarizing factors (edhfs) are substances that have been proposed to be involved in the regulation of skeletal muscle blood flow during physical activity. we measured haemodynamics, plasma atp and at rest and during one‐legged knee‐extensor exercise (19 ± 1 w) in nine healthy subjects with and without intra‐arterial infusion of indomethacin (indo; 621 ± 17 μg min−1), indo +ng‐monomethyl‐l‐arginine (l‐nmma; 12.4 ± 0.3 mg min−1) (double blockade) and indo +l‐nmma + tetraethylammonium chloride (tea; 12.4 ± 0.3 mg min−1) (triple blockade). double and triple blockade lowered leg blood flow (lbf) at rest (p < 0.05), while it remained unchanged with indo. during exercise, lbf and vascular conductance were 2.54 ± 0.10 l min−1 and 25 ± 1 mmhg, respectively, in control and they were lower with double (33 ± 3 and 36 ± 4%, respectively) and triple (26 ± 4 and 28 ± 3%, respectively) blockade (p < 0.05), while there was no difference with indo. the lower lbf and vascular conductance with double and triple blockade occurred in parallel with a lower o2 delivery, cardiac output, heart rate and plasma [noradrenaline] (p < 0.05), while blood pressure remained unchanged and o2 extraction and femoral venous plasma [atp] increased. despite the increased o2 extraction, leg was 13 and 17% (triple and double blockade, respectively) lower than control in parallel to a lower femoral venous temperature and lactate release (p < 0.05). these results suggest that no and prostaglandins play important roles in skeletal muscle blood flow regulation during moderate intensity exercise and that edhfs do not compensate for the impaired formation of no and prostaglandins. moreover, inhibition of no and prostaglandin formation is associated with a lower aerobic energy turnover and increased concentration of vasoactive atp in plasma.
