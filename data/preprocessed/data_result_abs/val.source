background most us adolescents do not meet guidelines of at least 60 daily minutes of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity. in addition, sedentary behaviors among this age group are of increasing concern. this study examined the association of movement behaviors with cardiovascular fitness among us adolescents.   methods data from the 2012 nhanes national youth fitness survey were used to assess the association of movement behaviors (physical activity, sedentary time, screen time) with cardiovascular fitness among adolescent males and females. multiple logistic regressions were used to test the independent and interactive effects of movement behaviors on cardiovascular fitness.   results among females, physical activity was directly associated with cardiovascular fitness; no significant association was observed between sedentary behaviors and cvf. among males, sedentary time moderated the relationship between physical activity and cardiovascular fitness, such that a significant, direct association was only observed among those with high sedentary time (or: 5.01; 95% ci: 1.60, 15.70).   conclusions results from this cross-sectional analysis suggest that among female us adolescents, physical activity, but not sedentary behavior, is associated with cardiovascular fitness. among males, the interaction between physical activity and sedentary time seems to be important for cardiovascular fitness. longitudinal studies are warranted to confirm these findings. background during childhood and adolescence, both physical activity (pa) and sedentary behaviour seem to influence cardiorespiratory fitness (crf); however, the combined association of pa and sedentary behaviour remains to be understood. we analysed the combined association of objectively measured sedentary behaviour and moderate-to-vigorous intensity pa (mvpa) on crf in portuguese children and adolescents. methods the sample comprised 2506 portuguese healthy children and adolescents aged 10–18 years, from a cross-sectional school-based study (2008). pa and sedentary behaviour were assessed with accelerometry. participants were classified as meeting current pa guidelines for youth versus not meeting, and as low versus high sedentary (according to the median value of sedentary time/day by age and gender), and then grouped as follows: low active—high sedentary; low active—low sedentary; high active—high sedentary; high active—low sedentary. crf was assessed with the fitnessgram 20 m shuttle-run test. binary logistic regression models were constructed to verify the relationship between high crf and the combined influence of mvpa/sedentary behaviour, adjusting for age, gender, body mass index and accelerometer wear time. results participants classified as high active/low sedentary (or=1.81; 95% ci 1.21 to 2.69), as well as those classified as low active/low sedentary (or=1.27; 95% ci 1.01 to 1.61) were more likely to be fit, compared with those from the low-active/high-sedentary group. conclusion mvpa and sedentary behaviour may act independently in their relation with crf, and that mvpa levels may not overcome the deleterious influence of high-sedentary time in maximising crf.
elastic network models (enms) are valuable and efficient tools for characterizing the collective internal dynamics of proteins based on the knowledge of their native structures. the increasing evidence that the biological functionality of rnas is often linked to their innate internal motions poses the question of whether enm approaches can be successfully extended to this class of biomolecules. this issue is tackled here by considering various families of elastic networks of increasing complexity applied to a representative set of rnas. the fluctuations predicted by the alternative enms are stringently validated by comparison against extensive molecular dynamics simulations and shape experiments. we find that simulations and experimental data are systematically best reproduced by either an all-atom or a three-beads-per-nucleotide representation (sugar-base-phosphate), with the latter arguably providing the best balance of accuracy and computational complexity. elastic network models (enms) are a useful tool for describing large scale motions in protein systems. while they are well validated in the context of proteins, relatively little is known about their applicability to nucleic acids, whose different architecture does not necessarily warrant comparable performance. in this study we thoroughly evaluate and optimize the efficiency of popular enms for capturing rna and dna flexibility. we also introduce two alternative models in which the strength of elastic connections at a coarse-grained level is governed by distance distribution at atomic resolution. for each of the considered enms we report the optimal length of spring connections as well as the scaling of elastic force constants that provides the best agreement of vibrational frequencies with normal modes based on atomic force field. in order to determine the absolute values of force constants we introduce a novel method based on the overlap of pseudoinverse of hessian matrices.
in this study, the antioxidant effect of aminoguanidine on nephrotoxicity of a single dose of cisplatin is investigated and compared with the effects of well-known antioxidants vitamin c and e combination. tubular damage and perivascular inflammation were observed in kidney samples of the cisplatin-administered groups. aminoguanidine and vitamin c-e combination are found to be capable of preventing these effects of cisplatin. liver tissues of all groups were intact. cisplatin-induced oxidative stress was evidenced by significant decrease in glutathione and significant increase in malondialdehyde levels in kidney samples. antioxidants with cisplatin decreased malondialdehyde levels. antioxidants with cisplatin prevented the decrease in liver glutathione levels. the nephrotoxicity was confirmed biochemically by significant elevation of serum urea and creatinine levels. both vitamin c-e combination and aminoguanidine prevented the increase in serum urea levels according to the cisplatin group. the effect of aminoguanidine (ag) on nephrotoxicity induced by cisplatin (cddp) was investigated. a single dose of cddp (7.5 mg/kg i.p.) induced nephrotoxicity, manifested biochemically by a significant elevation in serum urea, creatinine and a severe decrease in serum albumin. moreover, marked increases in kidney weight, urine volume and urinary excretion of albumin were observed. nephrotoxicity was further confirmed by a significant decrease in glutathione-s-transferase (gst, e.c. 2.5.1.18), glutathione peroxidase (gsh-px, e.c. 1.11.1.9) and catalase (e.c. 1.11.1.6) and a significant increase in lipid peroxides measured as malondialdhyde (mda) in kidney homogenates. administration of ag (100 mg/kg per day p.o.) in drinking water 5 days before and 5 days after cddp injection produced a significant protection against nephrotoxicity induced by cddp. the amelioration of nephrotoxicity was evidenced by significant reductions in serum urea and creatinine concentrations. in addition, ag tended to normalize decreased levels of serum albumin. urine volume, urinary excretions of albumin and gst and kidney weight were significantly decreased. moreover, ag prevented the rise of mda and the reduction of gst and gsh-px activities in the kidney. these results suggest that ag has a protective effect on nephrotoxicity induced by cddp and it may therefore improve the therapeutic index of cddp.
aims to describe the effects of tolvaptan therapy on dyspnoea relief based on timing of delivery, influence of concomitant therapies, and baseline patient and clinical characteristics. also, the influence of clinical trial design on dyspnoea measurement, from the efficacy of vasopressin antagonism in heart failure outcome study with tolvaptan (everest) trials.   methods and results post hoc analysis was performed based on the endpoint of patient-assessed dyspnoea. changes from baseline at inpatient day 1 were compared between treatment groups by the van elteren test. pre-determined subgroup analyses were also performed. tolvaptan's effects are greatest within 12 h after first dose with an additional, but modest dyspnoea improvement benefit irrespective of time after admission. overall, patients continue to report dyspnoea improvement up to 60 h after admission. the window of enrolment, up to 48 h after admission, combined with measurement on 'day 1' led to a wide range over when dyspnoea was assessed.   conclusion post hoc analysis suggests that tolvaptan modestly improves dyspnoea compared with standard therapy alone, regardless if given early or relatively late after hospitalization, and also across major pre-specified subgroups, despite ongoing background therapy aimed at relieving signs and symptoms. significant variability around when dyspnoea was assessed, in addition to the persistence of dyspnoea despite ongoing background therapy, may influence how future clinical trials assess dyspnoea in acute heart failure syndromes. context decompensated congestive heart failure (chf) is the leading hospital discharge diagnosis in patients older than 65 years.   objective to compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous nesiritide, intravenous nitroglycerin, and placebo.   design, setting, and patients randomized, double-blind trial of 489 inpatients with dyspnea at rest from decompensated chf, including 246 who received pulmonary artery catheterization, that was conducted at 55 community and academic hospitals between october 1999 and july 2000.   interventions intravenous nesiritide (n = 204), intravenous nitroglycerin (n = 143), or placebo (n = 142) added to standard medications for 3 hours, followed by nesiritide (n = 278) or nitroglycerin (n = 216) added to standard medication for 24 hours.   main outcome measures change in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (pcwp) among catheterized patients and patient self-evaluation of dyspnea at 3 hours after initiation of study drug among all patients. secondary outcomes included comparisons of hemodynamic and clinical effects between nesiritide and nitroglycerin at 24 hours.   results at 3 hours, the mean (sd) decrease in pcwp from baseline was -5.8 (6.5) mm hg for nesiritide (vs placebo, p<.001; vs nitroglycerin, p =.03), -3.8 (5.3) mm hg for nitroglycerin (vs placebo, p =.09), and -2 (4.2) mm hg for placebo. at 3 hours, nesiritide resulted in improvement in dyspnea compared with placebo (p =.03), but there was no significant difference in dyspnea or global clinical status with nesiritide compared with nitroglycerin. at 24 hours, the reduction in pcwp was greater in the nesiritide group (-8.2 mm hg) than the nitroglycerin group (-6.3 mm hg), but patients reported no significant differences in dyspnea and only modest improvement in global clinical status.   conclusion when added to standard care in patients hospitalized with acutely decompensated chf, nesiritide improves hemodynamic function and some self-reported symptoms more effectively than intravenous nitroglycerin or placebo.
relationships are central to human life strategies and have crucial fitness consequences. yet, at the same time, they incur significant maintenance costs that are rarely considered in either social psychological or evolutionary studies. although many social psychological studies have explored their dynamics, these studies have typically focused on a small number of emotionally intense ties, whereas social networks in fact consist of a large number of ties that serve a variety of different functions. in this study, we examined how entire active personal networks changed over 18 months across a major life transition. family relationships and friendships differed strikingly in this respect. the decline in friendship quality was mitigated by increased effort invested in the relationship, but with a striking gender difference: relationship decline was prevented most by increased contact frequency (talking together) for females but by doing more activities together in the case of males. using a retrospective method, we assessed late adolescents' developmental theories about their affective relationships with their parents. subjects used drawings and questionnaire ratings to portray their relationships with parents at five points between infancy and the present. from infancy to their current age, adolescents portrayed their relationships in two major ways. they perceived themselves as gaining in responsibility, dominance, independence, and similarity from infancy to the present, whereas they portrayed their parents as experiencing a decline on these dimensions. for variables indicating closeness and love, however, there was a striking discontinuity in these linear trends: although adolescents perceived linear trends from infancy to adolescence, they depicted their current relationships as involving a great deal more love and closeness. they also portrayed their relationships with mothers and fathers somewhat differently. more responsibility was felt towards the mothers and they were portrayed as especially friendly, but subjects felt more similar to their fathers, whom they perceived as dominant. we interpreted the results as indicating that late adolescents constructed theories of the affective components of their relationships with their parents to serve the needs of separation while maintaining a close affective tie to the parents.
cd5 is a lymphoid-specific transmembrane glycoprotein constitutively expressed on thymocytes and mature t and b1a lymphocytes. current data support the view that cd5 is a negative regulator of antigen-specific receptor-mediated signaling in these cells, and that this would likely be achieved through interaction with cd5 ligand/s (cd5l) of still undefined nature expressed on immune or accessory cells. to determine the functional consequence of loss of cd5/cd5l interaction in vivo, a new transgenic mouse line was generated (shcd5eμtg), expressing a circulating soluble form of human cd5 (shcd5) as a decoy to impair membrane-bound cd5 function. these shcd5eμtg mice showed an enhanced response to autologous antigens, as deduced from the presentation of more severe forms of experimentally inducible autoimmune disease (collagen-induced arthritis, cia; and experimental autoimmune encephalitis, eae), as well as an increased anti-tumoral response in non-orthotopic cancer models (b16 melanoma). this enhancement of the immune response was in agreement with the finding of significantly reduced proportions of spleen and lymph node treg cells (cd4+cd25+foxp3+), and of peritoneal il-10-producing and cd5+ b cells, as well as an increased proportion of spleen nkt cells in shcd5eμtg mice. similar changes in lymphocyte subpopulations were observed in wild-type mice following repeated administration of exogenous recombinant shcd5 protein. these data reveal the relevant role played by cd5/cd5l interactions on the homeostasis of some functionally relevant lymphocyte subpopulations and the modulation of immune responses to autologous antigens. cd5 is a 67 kda type i glycoprotein which belongs to the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (srcr) family of receptors. this family includes either cell-surface (e.g. cd6) or secreted (e.g. spalpha) proteins implicated in the development of the immune system and the regulation of immune responses. in this study, we purified and characterised a circulating natural soluble cd5 form (nscd5) which is indistinguishable (in apparent molecular mass, glycosylation pattern, and antibody reactivity) from a recombinant soluble cd5 form (rscd5) composed of the three extracellular scrc domains. the nscd5 is a n-glycosylated 52 kda molecule present in normal human serum and in supernatants of in vitro phorbol ester- and cd3-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. the nscd5 concentration in sera from healthy donors is relatively low (median 1.75 ng/ml, rn=166) and is similar to that found in sera from patients suffering of various autoimmune (systemic lupus erythematosus, primary sjogren syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis) and non-autoimmune (chronic renal failure, b-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia) disorders. in vitro experiments indicate that nscd5 is released by proteolytic cleavage of the membrane form. these results represent the first evidence of proteolytic release of a transmembrane srcr family member following cell activation.
backgroundanxiety and depression can be a long-term strain in cancer survivors. little is known about the emotional situation of cancer survivors who have to deal with work- and family-related issues. the purpose of this study was to investigate anxiety and depression in working-age cancer survivors and associated factors.methodsa register-based sample of 3370 cancer survivors (25 to 55 years at time of diagnosis) diagnosed up to six years prior to the survey was recruited from two german cancer registries. demographic and medical characteristics as well as self-reported measures were used.resultsoverall, approximately 40% of the survivors reported moderate to high anxiety scores and approximately 20% reported moderate to high depression scores. compared to the general population, working-age cancer survivors were more anxious but less depressed (p < .001). subgroups with regard to time since diagnosis did not differ in anxiety or depression. anxiety and depression in cancer survivors were associated with various variables. better social support, family functioning and physical health were associated with lower anxiety and depression.conclusionsoverall, we found higher anxiety levels in cancer survivors of working-age than in the general population. a considerable portion of cancer survivors reported moderate to high levels of anxiety and depression. the results indicate the need for psychosocial screening and psycho-oncological support e.g. in survivorship programs for working-age cancer survivors. assessing the physical health, social support and family background might help to identify survivors at risk for higher emotional distress. the objective of this study was to explore the psychosocial impact of cancer on newly diagnosed adolescent and young adult (aya) cancer patients.
the proliferation test with human estrogen receptor-positive mcf-7 breast cancer cells (e-screen assay) was applied for quantitative determination of total estrogenic activity in 24-h composite effluent samples from 16 municipal and two industrial sewage treatment plants (stps) in the state of baden-württemberg, southwestern germany. the estrogenic efficacy relative to the positive control, 17beta-estradiol, was between 26 and 74% (median, 48%) for the 16 municipal stps. estradiol equivalent concentrations (eeqs) were between 0.2 and 7.8 ng/l (median, 1.6 ng/l) and, thereby, were lower than those found in a pilot study, which revealed eeqs of greater than 10 ng/l in the effluents of two other stps. the eeqs in 14 of the 16 effluent samples were very similar (0.9-3.3 ng/l), indicating a rather constant input of estrogenic substances via stps into rivers. additional activated charcoal filtration turned out to be very efficient in further eliminating estrogenic activity from effluents. the eeqs of the e-screen assay and those calculated from the results of extensive chemical analysis using the estradiol equivalency factors determined for 13 natural and synthetic estrogenic substances were comparable for most of the effluent samples. 17beta-estradiol, 17alpha-ethinylestradiol, and, to a lesser extent, estrone contributed to 90% or more of the eeq value. the cdna of rainbow trout estrogen receptor (rter), highly and stably expressed in yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae, was used to analyse the biological activity of the receptor. the rter mrna encoded a 65-kda protein which was immunorevealed by a specific antibody and migrated with the authentic rter major protein form detected in trout liver. yeast rter bound estradiol with high affinity and the dissociation constant (kd = 1.35 nm) was very similar to the value measured from trout liver extracts but 3-5-fold higher than the kd found for human estrogen receptor (her). this indicates therefore that the rter has a lower estradiol affinity compared to the human receptor. while the her kd remained unchanged at both 4 degrees c or 22 degrees c, it was slightly modified at 30 degrees c. the kd measured for rter at 22 degrees c and 30 degrees c were about 2-fold, and 12-fold higher, respectively, than the kd obtained at 4 degrees c suggesting an alteration of the rter affinity for its ligand at elevated temperature. to examine the estrogen-receptor-mediated activation of transcription in yeast, reporter plasmids integrated or not in the yeast genome were used. the reporter genes consist of one, two, or three copies of estrogen-responsive elements (ere) upstream of the yeast proximal cyc1 or ura3 promoters fused to the lacz gene of escherichia coli coding for beta-galactosidase. the induction of beta-galactosidase activity for all reporter genes was strictly dependent on the presence of rter and estrogens. the activation of transcription mediated by rter responded in an estradiol-dose-dependent manner as in animal cells. however, compared to her, the estradiol concentration necessary to achieve maximal activation was 10-fold higher. this is probably a consequence of the lower estradiol-affinity for rter compared to her. the levels of induction of the reporter genes containing two or three ere were strongly enhanced compared to the one ere construct. this is in agreement with the synergistic effect previously described for multiple ere. the magnitudes of transcriptional induction mediated by rter and her were similar when the reporter gene containing three ere was used but changed when the one ere construct was used. in this case transcriptional activation indicated by rter was 10-20 fold lower. this suggests that rter requires protein/protein interaction for its stabilization on dna. antiestrogens were able to bind rter and promote gene transcription. however, to produce effects comparable to those obtained with estrogens, much higher concentrations were required. this may imply nonetheless that antihormones were capable of provoking efficient interactions of rter with the transcriptional machinery.
artificial vegetation restoration can induce variations in accumulation and distribution of soil carbon (c), nitrogen (n) and phosphorus (p). however, little is known about variations in soil c, n and p nutrient fraction stratification following artificial vegetation in loess plateau china. based on the hypothesis that re-vegetated can improve soil quality and stratification ratios (sr) can be used as an indicator to evaluate soil quality. this study measured contents and storages of soil organic carbon (soc), total nitrogen (tn), total phosphorus (tp) and their srs in topsoil (0–20 cm) and subsoil (20–60 cm) in three 30-year re-vegetated lands that had been converted from arable land (robinia pseudoacacia l., caragana korshinskii kom. and abandoned cropland with low interferences and few management measures) and one slope cropland (sc) as a control for three soil profiles(0–20 cm, 20–40 cm and 40–60 cm) from june 2009 to june 2013. the results showed that the contents and storages of soc, tn and tp in re-vegetated land were significantly higher than those in the sc in both topsoil and subsoil. the storages of soc, tn and tp in the topsoil (0–20 cm) of the re-vegetated lands increased by 16.2%-26.4%, 12.7%-28.4% and 16.5%-20.9%, respectively, and increased by smaller but significant amounts in subsoil from 2009 to 2013. the srs for soc, tn and tp in the re-vegetated lands were mostly >2 (either for 0–20:20–40 cm or 0–20:40–60 cm) and greater than that in the sc. the srs showed an increasing trend with increasing restoration age. the results also showed that the land use type and soil depth were the most influential factors for the srs and storages, and the srs of soc and tn had significantly positive correlations with their storages. the srs were concluded to be a good indicator for evaluating the soil quality, which can be significantly enhanced through vegetation restoration. moreover, vegetation restoration can significantly enhance soc, tn and tp accumulation in both topsoil and subsoil. as the largest pool of terrestrial organic carbon, soils interact strongly with atmospheric composition, climate, and land cover change. our capacity to predict and ameliorate the consequences of global change depends in part on a better understanding of the distributions and controls of soil organic carbon (soc) and how vegetation change may affect soc distributions with depth. the goals of this paper are (1) to examine the association of soc content with climate and soil texture at different soil depths; (2) to test the hypothesis that vegetation type, through patterns of allocation, is a dominant control on the vertical distribution of soc; and (3) to estimate global soc storage to 3 m, including an analysis of the potential effects of vegetation change on soil carbon storage. we based our analysis on .2700 soil profiles in three global databases supplemented with data for climate, vegetation, and land use. the analysis focused on mineral soil layers. plant functional types significantly affected the vertical distribution of soc. the per- centage of soc in the top 20 cm (relative to the first meter) averaged 33%, 42%, and 50% for shrublands, grasslands, and forests, respectively. in shrublands, the amount of soc in the second and third meters was 77% of that in the first meter; in forests and grasslands, the totals were 56% and 43%, respectively. globally, the relative distribution of soc with depth had a slightly stronger association with vegetation than with climate, but the opposite was true for the absolute amount of soc. total soc content increased with precipitation and clay content and decreased with temperature. the importance of these controls switched with depth, climate dominating in shallow layers and clay content dominating in deeper layers, possibly due to increasing percentages of slowly cycling soc fractions at depth. to control for the effects of climate on vegetation, we grouped soils within climatic ranges and compared distributions for vegetation types within each range. the percentage of soc in the top 20 cm relative to the first meter varied from 29% in cold arid shrublands to 57% in cold humid forests and, for a given climate, was always deepest in shrublands, inter- mediate in grasslands, and shallowest in forests ( p , 0.05 in all cases). the effect of vegetation type was more important than the direct effect of precipitation in this analysis. these data suggest that shoot/root allocations combined with vertical root distributions, affect the distribution of soc with depth. global soc storage in the to p3mo fsoil was 2344 pg c, or 56% more than the 1502 pg estimated for the first meter (which is similar to the total soc estimates of 1500-1600 pg made by other researchers). global totals for the second and third meters were 491 and 351 pg c, and the biomes with the most soc at 1-3 m depth were tropical evergreen forests (158 pg c) and tropical grasslands/savannas (146 pg c). our work suggests that plant functional types, through differences in allocation, help to control soc distributions with depth in the soil. our analysis also highlights the potential importance of vegetation change and soc pools for carbon sequestration strategies.
an important and widely recognized condition of the maned wolf is cystinuria, or excess levels of cystine in the urine. cystinuria has been identified in the majority of maned wolves tested, both in captivity and in the wild. cystinuria also occurs in humans and domestic dogs, and has been demonstrated in these species to have a genetic basis. in all species afflicted with this condition clinical disease may occur secondary to urolith formation. the solubility of cystine in urine is ph-dependent and the unusually low urine ph of many captive maned wolves may predispose them to morbidity and mortality related to cystine urolithiasis. dietary modification is a significant component of cystinuria management in both human and canine patients. based on present knowledge, we hypothesize that through dietary modifications we can reduce urinary cystine concentrations as well as produce alterations in urinary ph which increase cystine solubility and decrease cystine urolith formation in captive maned wolves. this study was designed to characterize the effect of urinary sodium excretion on amino acid excretion in cystinuria. we studied three homozygous patients with cystinuria at various levels of sodium intake ranging between 50 and 230 mmol/day. a reduction in sodium intake produced a marked decrease in rates of urinary cysteine excretion. the low-sodium diet also reduced the excretion of lysine but had no significant effect on the excretion of ornithine or arginine. we conclude that a dietary restriction of sodium may reduce the urinary excretion of cystine and can provide a simple and safe long-term approach to the treatment of cystinuria.
using a new-keynesian model with endogenous capital accumulation, i show that uncertainty about fiscal policy can cause large declines in consumption, investment, and output when the zero lower bound (zlb) binds, but has modest effects when the monetary authority is not constrained by the zlb. i study uncertainty about the level of government spending and uncertainty about tax rates on consumption, wages, capital income, and investment. in my model, uncertainty about government spending and the wage tax rate has particularly large effects. i show that the effects of fiscal policy uncertainty are largest when the nominal interest rate is on the cusp of the zlb and also that delaying fiscal policy uncertainty diminishes its effects only if the resolution of uncertainty occurs after zlb no longer binds. many commentators argue that uncertainty about taxes, government spending and other policy matters deepened the recession of 2007-2009 and slowed the recovery. to investigate this issue we develop a new index of policy-related economic uncertainty and estimate its dynamic relationship to output, investment and employment. our index averages several components that reflect the frequency of news media references to economic policy uncertainty, the number of federal tax code provisions set to expire in future years, and the extent of forecaster disagreement over future inflation and federal government purchases. the index spikes near consequential presidential elections and after major events such as the gulf wars and the 9/11 attack. index values are very high in recent years with clear jumps around the lehman bankruptcy and tarp legislation, the 2010 midterm elections, the eurozone crisis and the u.s. debt-ceiling dispute. we also construct an index of european economic policy uncertainty mirroring our american news-based index. var estimates show that an increase in policy uncertainty equal to the actual change between 2006 and 2011 foreshadows large and persistent declines in aggregate outcomes, with peak declines of 3.2% in real gdp, 16% in private investment and 2.3 million in aggregate employment. jel no. d80, e22, e66, g18, l50
during the first week posthatch, the avian immune system is immature and inefficient at protecting chicks from invading pathogens. among immunomodulators, beta-glucans are known as biological response modifiers due to their ability to activate the immune system. current research suggests that beta-glucans may enhance avian immunity; however, very little is known about their influence on regulation of immune function. a study was performed to evaluate the effects of dietary beta-glucan on growth performance, immune organ weights, peripheral blood cell profiles, and immune-related gene expression in the intestine. one-day-old chicks were fed a diet containing 0, 0.02, or 0.1% yeast beta-glucan (n = 30/treatment). on d 7 and 14 posthatch, body and relative immune organ weights were measured and small intestinal sections were collected to evaluate gene expression by quantitative real-time pcr. peripheral blood samples were also collected to determine heterophil:lymphocyte ratios. supplementation of beta-glucan did not significantly affect bw gains, and no significant differences were observed among groups for relative immune organ weights or heterophil:lymphocyte ratios. compared with controls, expression of interleukin (il)-8 was downregulated in the beta-glucan-treated groups on d 7 and 14. on d 14, beta-glucan inclusion resulted in increased inducible nitric oxide synthase expression. expression of il-18 was upregulated on d 7 but reduced on d 14 due to beta-glucan supplementation. on d 7, interferon-gamma and il-4 expression decreased in the beta-glucan-treated groups. however, on d 14, il-4 expression was upregulated in the supplemented groups. intestinal expression of il-13 was also downregulated in the beta-glucan-treated birds on d 7. these results suggest that dietary inclusion of beta-glucans altered the cytokine-chemokine balance; however, it did not elicit a robust immune response in the absence of a challenge, resulting in no deleterious effects on performance. β-glucan, one of the major cell wall components of saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been found to enhance immune functions. this study investigated in vivo and in vitro effects of β-glucan on lymphoproliferation and interferonγ (ifn-γ) production by splenic cells from c57bl/6 female mice. all experiments were performed with particulate βglucan derived from s. cerevisiae. data demonstrated that both, i.p administration of particulate β-glucan (20 or 100 μg/animal) and in vitro stimulation of splenic cells (20 or 100 μg/ml of culture) decreased lymphoproliferation and ifn-γ production induced by concanavalin a. these results suggest that β-glucan can trigger a down-modulatory effect regulating a deleterious immune system hyperactivity in the presence of a strong stimulus.
an infrasonic observatory collocated with the colorado state university chill radar during the summer of 1995 permitted unique comparisons between severe storm kinematics and detected acoustic energy at subaudible frequencies near 1 hz. radar observations of a velocity couplet aloft (evolving into a tornado) showed a circulation maximum descending for about 30 min while moving to the east. the detected infrasound followed the trend of these observations. a model of sound radiated from vortex systems predicts frequencies in the range observed. these data are interpreted in the context of past infrasonic observations. an ongoing study comparing regional tornado and funnel sightings with archived infrasonic data has identified over 100 cases to date where the infrasonic signals occurred at the time of, and from the direction of, the vortices. for some of these cases, the distances were greater than 100 km. the author and his associates continue to collect datasets to permit further evaluation of infrasonic detection methods. abstract this paper attempts to explain the “whining” or “hissing” sound reported from tornadoes. the leading hypothesis is that the air masses involved in the tornado circulation execute some free vibrations. it is found that these vibrations may be in the audible range for a small vortex whose radius is of the order of 10 m. or less. a formula is obtained which relates the frequency of the tone to the inner radius of the vortex. this formula is amenable to experimental verification.
human papillomavirus type 16 (hpv-16) is the major causative agent of cervical cancer. to date, vaccine strategies against hpv-16 are based on the ability of the e7 oncoprotein to elicit an immune response against this virus. in this study, the use of an inducible or a constitutive system to produce the hpv-16 e7 protein in lactococcus lactis, a non-pathogenic and non-invasive gram-positive bacterium, was compared. the highest e7 production was obtained with the inducible system. when mice were immunized intranasally with recombinant lactococci expressing either inducible or constitutive e7, an antigen-specific cellular response (i.e. secretion of il2 and ifn-gamma cytokines) was evoked and was substantially higher in mice receiving l. lactis expressing e7 with the inducible system. as bacterial antigen location may influence the immune response, recombinant l. lactis strains that produced e7 in three cellular locations, intracellular, secreted or cell-wall-anchored were evaluated. the highest immune response was elicited by administration of l. lactis producing an inducible cell-wall-anchored form of e7 protein. these promising results represent a step towards the development of a new, safe mucosal vector to treat hpv-related cervical cancer. abstract interleukin-12 (il-12), a heterodimeric cytokine, plays an important role in cellular immunity to several bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections and has adjuvant activity when it is codelivered with dna vaccines. il-12 has also been used with success in cancer immunotherapy treatments. however, systemic il-12 therapy has been limited by high levels of toxicity. we describe here inducible expression and secretion of il-12 in the food-grade lactic acid bacterium lactococcus lactis. il-12 was expressed as two separate polypeptides (p35-p40) or as a single recombinant polypeptide (scil-12). the biological activity of il-12 produced by the recombinant l. lactis strain was confirmed in vitro by its ability to induce gamma interferon (ifn-γ) production by mouse splenocytes. local administration of il-12-producing strains at the intranasal mucosal surface resulted in ifn-γ production in mice. the activity was greater with the single polypeptide scil-12. an antigen-specific cellular response (i.e., secretion of th1 cytokines, il-2, and ifn-γ) elicited by a recombinant l. lactis strain displaying a cell wall-anchored human papillomavirus type 16 e7 antigen was dramatically increased by coadministration with an l. lactis strain secreting il-12 protein. our data show that il-12 is produced and secreted in an active form by l. lactis and that the strategy which we describe can be used to enhance an antigen-specific immune response and to stimulate local mucosal immunity.
we introduce an infinite class of polynomial sequences $a_t(n;z)$ with integer parameter $t\geq 1$, which reduce to the well-known stern (diatomic) sequence when $z=1$ and are $(0,1)$-polynomials when $t\geq 2$. using these polynomial sequences, we derive two different characterizations of all hyperbinary expansions of an integer $n\geq 1$. furthermore, we study the polynomials $a_t(n;z)$ as objects in their own right, obtaining a generating function and some consequences. we also prove results on the structure of these sequences, and determine expressions for the degrees of the polynomials. we define a q-analogue of the calkin-wilf tree and the calkin-wilf sequence. we show that the nth term f(n;q) of the q-analogue of the calkin-wilf sequence is the generating function for the number of hyperbinary expansions of n according to the number of powers that are used exactly twice. we also present formulae for branches within the q-analogue of the calkin-wilf tree and predecessors and successors of terms in the q-analogue of the calkin-wilf sequence.
backgroundmyc family members are among the most frequently deregulated oncogenes in human cancers, yet direct therapeutic targeting of myc in cancer has been challenging thus far. synthetic lethality provides an opportunity for therapeutic intervention of myc-driven cancers.methodsa pooled kinase shrna library screen was performed and next-generation deep sequencing efforts identified that prkdc was synthetically lethal in cells overexpressing myc. genes and proteins of interest were knocked down or inhibited using rnai technology and small molecule inhibitors, respectively. quantitative rt-pcr using taqman probes examined mrna expression levels and cell viability was assessed using celltiter-glo (promega). western blotting was performed to monitor different protein levels in the presence or absence of rnai or compound treatment. statistical significance of differences among data sets were determined using unpaired t test (mann–whitney test) or anova.resultsinhibition of prkdc using rnai (rna interference) or small molecular inhibitors preferentially killed myc-overexpressing human lung fibroblasts. moreover, inducible prkdc knockdown decreased cell viability selectively in high myc-expressing human small cell lung cancer cell lines. at the molecular level, we found that inhibition of prkdc downregulated myc mrna and protein expression in multiple cancer cell lines. in addition, we confirmed that overexpression of myc family proteins induced dna double-strand breaks; our results also revealed that prkdc inhibition in these cells led to an increase in dna damage levels.conclusionsour data suggest that the synthetic lethality between prkdc and myc may in part be due to prkdc dependent modulation of myc expression, as well as myc-induced dna damage where prkdc plays a key role in dna damage repair. dna repair mechanisms are essential for the maintenance of genomic integrity. disruption of gene products responsible for dna repair can result in chromosomal damage. improperly repaired chromosomal damage can result in the loss of chromosomes or the generation of chromosomal deletions or translocations, which can lead to tumorigenesis. the myc protooncogene is a transcription factor whose overexpression is frequently associated with human neoplasia. myc has not been previously implicated in a role in dna repair. here we report that the overexpression of myc disrupts the repair of double-strand dna breaks, resulting in a several-magnitude increase in chromosomal breaks and translocations. we found that myc inhibited the repair of γ irradiation dna breaks in normal human cells and blocked the repair of a single double-strand break engineered to occur in an immortal cell line. by spectral karyotypic analysis, we found that myc even within one cell division cycle resulted in a several-magnitude increase in the frequency of chromosomal breaks and translocations in normal human cells. hence, myc overexpression may be a previously undescribed example of a dominant mutator that may fuel tumorigenesis by inducing chromosomal damage.
the aims of this study were to determine the complexity of surgery required to revise failed unicompartmental knee replacements and to evaluate the outcome following revision. between 2000 and 2009, 494 cemented oxford phase 3 medial unicompartmental knee replacements were implanted, with 24 (4.9%) requiring revision (mean age: 63.5 years; 58% male). mean time to revision was 3.0 years. all cases were revised to a cemented total knee replacement, with primary components used in 67% and revision components in 33%. at a mean follow-up of 3.2 years the median oxford knee score was 333% with one knee requiring re-revision (5-year survival 933%). most failed unicompartmental knee replacements could be revised without the need for stemmed implants, augmentation, or bone allograft. when bone loss occured it was commonly on the tibial side. good functional outcome for the revised unicompartmental knee replacement was achieved and was comparable to primary knee replacement. recent reports suggest good outcome results following unicompartmental knee replacement (ukr). however, a number of authors have commented on the problem of osseous defects requiring technically difficult revision surgery. we reviewed clinical outcomes following revision total knee replacement (tkr) for failed ukr and analysed the reasons for failure and the technical aspects of the revision surgery. between 2001 and 2010 our institute performed 132 ukr's out of which 33 required revision to tkr during a period 6 years. demographics, details and indications for primary and revision surgery, the revised prosthesis including augments, technical difficulties and complications were noted. patient outcome assessment was based on the oxford knee score (oks). survival analysis for the ukr prosthesis was calculated using kaplan-meier survival curves. reasons for revision included aseptic loosening, persistent pain, dislocated meniscus, mal-alignment and other compartment osteoarthritis. median time to revision was 19 months (range 2-159). using revision as the end-point the survival proportion at 5-years was 69%. 18 revisions required additional intra-operative constructs including stemmed implants, wedge augmentation or bone graft. the mean 1 year post-operative oks was 29 compared to 39 for primary tkr during the same period (p<0.001). aseptic loosening was the commonest mode of failure. ukr survivorship at a non-specialist institute is considerably lower than at originating centres. two thirds of the revisions were technically difficult and required additional constructs. the clinical outcome after revision surgery was inferior to that of primary tkr. the role of ukr needs to be more clearly defined.
previous studies investigating the association between glutathione s-transferase m1 (gstm1) null genotype and laryngeal cancer risk reported controversial results. thus, a meta-analysis was performed to clarify the effect of gstm1 null genotype on laryngeal cancer risk. a literature search was performed for all possible studies. we estimated summary odd ratio (or) with its 95 % confidence interval (95 % ci) to assess the association. subgroup analyses were performed by ethnicity or the sample size. 24 individual case–control studies involving a total of 2,809 laryngeal cancer cases and 4,478 controls were finally included into this meta-analysis. meta-analyses of total 24 studies showed the gstm1 null genotype was significantly associated with increased laryngeal cancer risk (random-effects or = 1.44, 95 % ci 1.19–1.73, p < 0.001). subgroup analyses by ethnicity showed that the gstm1 null genotype was associated with increased laryngeal cancer risk in both caucasians (fixed-effects or = 1.17, 95 % ci 1.04–1.33, p = 0.012) and asians (random-effects or = 1.89, 95 % ci 1.28–2.77, p = 0.001). also, subgroup analyses by sample size also further identified this association above. the cumulative meta-analyses showed a trend of more obvious association between gstm1 null genotype and increased risk of laryngeal cancer as information accumulated by year. meta-analysis of available data suggests that gstm1 null genotype contributes to increased laryngeal cancer risk in both caucasians and east asians. glutathione s-transferase (gst) isoenzymes are involved in the detoxification of several tobacco smoke-derived carcinogens. it is thus conceivable that deficiency in gst activity due to homozygous deletion of the gstm1 and gstt1 genes (the null genotypes) may modulate susceptibility to smoking-induced cancers. the effects of the gstm1 and gstt1 null genotypes on laryngeal cancer risk were evaluated using peripheral blood dna from 129 larynx cancer patients and 172 noncancer controls, all of whom were regular smokers. increased larynx cancer risk was related to the gstm1 null genotype [odds ratio (or) = 1.6, 95% confidence interval (ci) = 1.0-2.8]. the or associated with the gstt1 null genotype was increased, although not significantly (or = 1.4, 95% ci = 0.7-2.9). individuals with concurrent lack of gstm1 and gstt1 genes had a doubled, although not significant, risk for larynx cancer when compared with those having at least one of these genes (or = 2.0, 95% ci = 0.8-5.2) and had almost a 3-fold risk (or = 2.7, 95% ci = 1.0-7.4) when compared with those with both genes. moreover, a significant interaction between the gstm1 genotype and levels of tobacco consumption (p < 0.05) was found; the gstm1 null genotype was associated with an increased risk of larynx cancer among smokers of 20 g/day or less (or = 2.9, 95% ci = 1.3-6.3) but not among heavier smokers (or = 1.0; 95% ci = 0.5-2.0). in contrast, the gstt1 null genotype posed an increased, although not significant, risk among long-term smokers (or = 2.3, 95% ci = 0.9-5.4).
introduction one-year mortality in copd patients is reported to be between 4% and 43%, depending on the group examined. aim to examine the one-year mortality in copd patients after severe exacerbation and the correlation between mortality and patients’ characteristics and comorbidities. methods a total of 152 copd patients hospitalized for severe exacerbation were assessed for vitamin d status, diabetes mellitus (dm), arterial hypertension (ah), and metabolic syndrome (ms). data were gathered about smoking status and number of exacerbations in previous year. cat and mmrc questionnaires were completed by all patients. pre- and post-bronchodilatory spirometry was performed. one-year mortality was established from national death register. results one-year mortality is 7.2%. dm, ms, and vd are not predictors for one-year mortality. however there is a trend for increased mortality in patients with ah (9.5% vs. 2.1%, p = 0.107). there is increased mortality in patients with mmrc > 2 (11.1 vs. 0%, p = 0.013). the presence of severe exacerbation in the previous year is a risk factor for mortality (12.5% vs. 1.4%, p = 0.009). there is a trend for increased mortality in the group with fev1 < 50% (11.5 vs. 4.4%, p = 0.094). cox regression shows 3.7% increase in mortality rate for 1% decrease in fev1, 5.2% for 1% decrease in pef, 7.8% for one year age increase and 8.1% for 1 cat point increase (all p < 0.05). conclusions this study finds relatively low one-year mortality in copd patients after surviving severe exacerbation. grade c and fev1 > 80% may be factors for good prognosis. risk factors for increased mortality are age, fev1 value, severe exacerbation in previous year and reduced quality of life. the aim of this study was to assess long-term mortality and predictive factors of death after hospital admission for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). 1824 patients (23.2% female; mean age 70.3±11.3 years) consecutively admitted for acute exacerbation of copd in the respiratory medicine departments of 68 general hospitals between october 2006 and june 2007 were prospectively enrolled in a follow-up cohort. their vital status was documented between october 2010 and april 2011. vital status was available for 1750 patients (95.9%), among whom 787 (45%) died during follow-up. multivariate analysis found that age (60–80 years and ≥80 years versus <60 years, relative risk 2.99, 95% ci 2.31–3.89), lower body mass index (25–30 kg·m−2 versus ≤20 kg·m−2, relative risk 0.80, 95% ci 0.66–0.97), lung cancer (relative risk 2.08, 95% ci 1.43–3.01), cardiovascular comorbidity (relative risk 1.35, 95% ci 1.16–1.58), previous hospital admissions for acute exacerbation of copd (four or more versus none, relative risk 1.91, 95% ci 1.44–2.53), use of accessory respiratory muscles (relative risk 1.19, 95% ci 1.01–1.40) or lower-limb oedema (relative risk 1.74, 95% ci (1.44–2.12)) at admission and treatment by long-term oxygen therapy at discharge (relative risk 2.09, 95% ci 1.79–2.45) were independent risk factors of death. mortality rate during the 4 years following hospital admission for acute exacerbation of copd was high (45%). simple clinical information relating to respiratory and general status can help in identifying high-risk patients and targeting more intensive follow-up and care. interestingly, cardiovascular comorbidities and past hospitalisations for acute exacerbation of copd, but not forced expiratory volume in 1 s, independently predicted the risk of death. long-term risk of death after hospitalisation for acute exacerbation of copd is high but can be readily identified http://ow.ly/li4gz
the social environment has potent effects on individual phenotype and fitness in group-living species. we asked whether the presence of kin might act on energy allocation, a central aspect of life-history variation. using a 22-year data set on reproductive and somatic allocations in columbian ground squirrels (urocitellus columbianus), we tested the effects of co-breeding and non-breeding kin on the fitness and energy allocation balance between reproduction and personal body condition of individual females. greater numbers of co-breeding kin had a positive effect on the number of offspring weaned, through the mechanism of altering energy allocation patterns. on average, females with higher numbers of co-breeding kin did not increase energy income but biased energy allocation towards reproduction. co-breeding female kin ground squirrels maintain close nest burrows, likely providing a social buffer against territorial invasions from non-kin ground squirrels. lower aggressiveness, lower risks of infanticide from female kin and greater protection of territorial boundaries may allow individual females to derive net fitness benefits via their energy allocation strategies. we demonstrated the importance of kin effects on a fundamental life-history trade-off. since w. d. hamilton's seminal work on the evolution of sociality, a large body of research has accumulated on how kin selection might explain the evolution of cooperation in many group-living species. our study examined the evolutionary basis of philopatry and cooperation; specifically, whether individuals benefit from the presence of close kin. we applied an individual fitness approach to a 16-year study of columbian ground squirrels (urocitellus columbianus) to investigate potential causal paths by which the presence of kin might act on individual fitness. our results indicate that individual fitness benefits resulted from associations of philopatric female kin, and support the hypothesis that increased tolerance of proximity of kin is a proximate mechanism for these benefits. the major life-history influence of kin on individual fitness was through improved reproductive success, and this benefit may have been owing to philopatric settlement of kin that were recognized through familiarization in the natal burrow. thus, we demonstrated an evolutionary basis necessary for ongoing kin-selected cooperation in columbian ground squirrels, though the mechanism of familiarity may determine which kin individuals benefit from cooperative behaviours.
background cancer-related fatigue (crf) is a common symptom affecting patients with cancer. there are an increasing number of trials examining potential treatments for crf. methylphenidate represents one of the most researched drugs and an up-to-date assessment of the evidence for its use is needed. trials of methylphenidate for crf provided inconsistent results. this meta-analysis was aimed at assessing the effect and safety of methylphenidate on crf. methods we comprehensively searched the pubmed, embase, psychinfo and the cochrane databases in order to identify published studies on the effect of methylphenidate on crf. primary outcomes included fatigue. secondary outcomes included depression, cognition and adverse effects. findings a meta-analysis was conducted on five randomized controlled trials and 498 patients were enrolled. despite a large placebo effect observed in the studies included, pooled data suggested therapeutic effect of methylphenidate on crf. subgroup analyses showed that the efficacy of methylphenidate on crf is getting better with prolonging treatment duration, with a md of −3.70 (95% ci −7.03– −0.37, p = 0.03) for long-time group and a md of −2.49 (95% ci −6.01–1.03, p = 0.17) for short-time group. in general, there was no impact of methylphenidate on depression and cognition associated with crf. adverse events were similar between methylphenidate and placebo groups except that more patients reported vertigo, anxiety, anorexia and nausea in methylphenidate group compared to placebo group. conclusion existing trials of methylphenidate on crf provided limited evidence for the use of methylphenidate to treat crf. the absolute numbers still remain small, and further confirmation is needed before firm recommendations on their usage and safety can be made in the treatment of crf. abstract attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) often persists into adulthood. stimulant drugs, including methylphenidate, have showed efficacy in trials for adhd in adults. adult psychiatrists are likely to encounter increasing numbers of adult patients who may benefit from methylphenidate. a systematic review of the literature was made to examine the evidence on the safety of methylphenidate, when used therapeutically in adults. twenty-six placebo-controlled trials were found, in which 811 adults received methylphenidate for adhd and other conditions. in the short term, methylphenidate was well tolerated and no serious side effects were observed. there is little information on the long-term safety of methylphenidate in adults, although the number of serious adverse effects reported to regulatory authorities has, so far, been low. methylphenidate is associated with a modest rise in blood pressure and heart rate. surveys of stimulant use in us universities show that misuse of prescribed medication, for recreation or to enhance study, is fairly common although the level of harm that arises from this practice is unclear.
the cinnamon flounder pseudorhombus cinnamoneus is a frequently consumed marine fish in china. however, the occurrence of ascaridoid larvae in p. cinnamoneus remains unclear. in the present study, a total of 85 p. cinnamoneus caught from the yellow sea (off shidao, 36°52'57″n, 122°26'42″e) in 2011, which is located between mainland china and the korean peninsula, was investigated for ascaridoid larval infection. four ascaridoid larval types, including anisakis type i of berland (1961), hysterothylacium type of smith (1983), hysterothylacium type hl of guo et al. (2014) and raphidascaris type of zhao et al. (2016), were detected in this important food fish. these larval types were identified as anisakis pegreffii, hysterothylacium aduncum, h. sinense and raphidascaris lophii, respectively, using pcr-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) analysis and sequencing of the its region of nuclear ribosomal dna (rdna). the third-stage larvae of h. sinense are reported from chinese waters for the first time. the prevalence of h. sinense was 100% and represents the predominant species of the ascaridoid larvae found in p. cinnamoneus. the prevalences of a. pegreffii and h. aduncum were 44.7% and 81.2%, respectively. phylogenetic analyses based on its sequences were performed to elucidate the genetic relationships of these ascaridoid nematodes. the present study increases the knowledge and distribution of ascaridoid larvae in this area of yellow sea. the high prevalence of ascaridoid larvae in p. cinnamoneus shows that an assessment needs to be undertaken to assess the risk these parasites may pose to public health. two cases of gastric anisakiasis have been documented in two italian women who had consumed raw anchovies (engraulis encrasicolus). the first patient was a 49-year-old woman presenting with epigastric pain and bloody vomiting after ingestion of marinated (vinegar) raw anchovies. during the esophagogastroduodenoscopy (egds) a white color worm was detected and extracted from cardia by means of biopsy forceps. the second patient was a 59-year-old woman with irritable bowel syndrome and gastritis, who underwent to periodical egdss. in the course of the last egds, a white color round worm on antrum and a small polyp on the fundus of the stomach were observed. the two nematodes have been identified as l3 larvae of the genus anisakis by a light microscope, and as anisakis pegreffi by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. the molecular identification of the etiological agent at the species level allows to identify what anisakidae species play a zoonotic role and which are the fish host species.
cardiac amyloid deposition in fmf may cause increased qt dispersion (qtd), a marker for cardiac arrhythmias. the aim of this study was to further evaluate repolarization dispersion in familial mediterranean fever (fmf) with amyloidosis. findings on 12-lead electrocardiography were compared between 18 patients with fmf-amyloidosis and 18 age- and sex-matched control subjects. repolarization and dispersion parameters were computed with designated computer software, and results of the 5 beats were subsequently averaged. there were no statistically significant differences between the groups as to average corrected qt interval length, average qtd interval, average qt corrected dispersion, or qt dispersion ratio. jt dispersion and jt corrected dispersion were also similar in both groups. in conclusion, patients with fmf-amyloidosis seem to have qt and jt dispersion parameters similar to those of healthy subjects. future research and longer follow-ups should be conducted in order to evaluate the prognostic importance of repolarization dispersion parameters in amyloidosis of fmf. the aim of the study was to further evaluate repolarization dispersion in familial mediterranean fever (fmf). findings on 12-lead electrocardiography were compared with 32 patients with uncomplicated fmf and age- and sex-matched control subjects. all procedures followed stringent standards. repolarization and dispersion parameters were computed with designated computer software, and results of the five beats were subsequently averaged. there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in average qt and average corrected qt interval length, average qt interval dispersion, average qt corrected dispersion, or qt dispersion ratio. during 6 months of follow-up, no cases of sudden death or arrhythmia were documented in either group. patients with fmf who are continuously treated with low-dose colchicine and have not developed amyloidosis seem to have qt dispersion parameters similar to those of healthy subjects and therefore apparently have no increased risk of adverse cardiac events associated with abnormal repolarization.
objectiveacute kidney injury (aki) after cardiac surgery procedures is associated with poor patient outcomes. cystatin c as a marker for renal failure has been shown to be of prognostic value; however, a wide range of its predictive accuracy has been reported. the aim of the study was to evaluate whether the measurement of pre- and postoperative serum cystatin c improves the prediction of aki.methodsin a single-centre, prospective study of 70 patients (74 ± 9ys; range 47-85ys; 77% male), cystatin c was measured six times: (t1 = preoperative, t2 = start cardiopulmonary bypass (cpb), t3 = 20 min after cpb, t4 = end of operation; t5 = 24 h postoperatively; t6 = 7d postoperatively). predictive property, in terms of the need for renal replacement therapy (rrt), was analysed by receiver operating characteristics (roc) statistics and described by the area under the curve (auc).resultswith respect to rrt (n = 8), serum cystatin c was significantly higher at the end of the operation (t4), 24 h postoperatively at t5 and at t6. the aucs for preoperative t1 and intraoperative t2/3 cystatin c were <0.7 (95% ci, 0.47-0.85). the earliest significant predictive aucs were found at the end of the operation (t4: p = 0.03 95% ci 0.58-0.88 auc 0.73) and 24 h postoperatively (t5: p = 0.003 95% ci 0.74-0.96 auc 0.85).conclusionsearly postoperative serum cystatin c increase appears to be a moderate biomarker in the prediction of aki, whereas a preoperative and intraoperative cystatin c increase has only a limited diagnostic and predictive value. introductionin critically ill patients sudden changes in glomerular filtration rate (gfr) are not instantly followed by parallel changes in serum creatinine. the aim of the present study was to analyze the utility of serum cystatin c as a marker of renal function in these patients.methodsserum creatinine, serum cystatin c and 24-hour creatinine clearance (ccr) were determined in 50 critically ill patients (age 21–86 years; mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii score 20 ± 9). they did not have chronic renal failure but were at risk for developing renal dysfunction. serum cystatin c was measured using particle enhanced immunonephelometry. twenty-four-hour body surface adjusted ccr was used as a control because it is the 'gold standard' for determining gfr.resultsserum creatinine, serum cystatin c and ccr (mean ± standard deviation [range]) were 1.00 ± 0.85 mg/dl (0.40–5.61 mg/dl), 1.19 ± 0.79 mg/l (0.49–4.70 mg/l), and 92.74 ± 52.74 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (8.17–233.21 ml/min per 1.73 m2), respectively. our data showed that serum cystatin c correlated better with gfr than did creatinine (1/cystatin c versus ccr: r = 0.832, p < 0.001; 1/creatinine versus ccr: r = 0.426, p = 0.002). cystatin c was diagnostically superior to creatinine (area under the curve [auc] for cystatin c 0.927, 95% confidence interval 86.1–99.4; auc for creatinine 0.694, 95% confidence interval 54.1–84.6). half of the patients had acute renal dysfunction. only five (20%) of these 25 patients had elevated serum creatinine, whereas 76% had elevated serum cystatin c levels (p = 0.032).conclusioncystatin c is an accurate marker of subtle changes in gfr, and it may be superior to creatinine when assessing this parameter in clinical practice in critically ill patients.
backgroundmechanosensitive afferents innervating the bladder increase their firing rate as the bladder fills and pressure rises. however, the relationship between afferent firing rates and intravesical pressure is not a simple linear one. firing rate responses to pressure can differ depending on prior activity, demonstrating hysteresis in the system. though this hysteresis has been commented on in published literature, it has not been quantified.resultssixty-six bladder afferents recorded from sacral dorsal root ganglia in five alpha-chloralose anesthetized felines were identified based on their characteristic responses to pressure (correlation coefficient ≥ 0.2) during saline infusion (2 ml/min). for saline infusion trials, we calculated a maximum hysteresis ratio between the firing rate difference at each pressure and the overall firing rate range (or hmax) of 0.86 ± 0.09 (mean ± standard deviation) and mean hysteresis ratio (or hmean) of 0.52 ± 0.13 (n = 46 afferents). for isovolumetric trials in two experiments (n = 33 afferents) hmax was 0.72 ± 0.14 and hmean was 0.40 ± 0.14.conclusionsa comprehensive state model that integrates these hysteresis parameters to determine the bladder state may improve upon existing neuroprostheses for bladder control. although sacral anterior root neuromodulation (sarn) has proven to be effective in patients with neurogenic bladder, it is not widely accepted due to the need to conduct a dorsal rhizotomy, and commercially available sarn devices are not usually equipped with a closed-loop controller for the automatic regulation of bladder functions. therefore, there is still a need for a more effective electrical neuromodulation scheme to restore bladder function. intravesical pressure (ivp) is the major biosignal that reflects the state of bladder conditions. the present study develops a closed-loop control strategy for improving bladder emptying and verifies its performance using animal experiments. two channel outputs of electrical currents triggered by ivp-feedback signals were set to automatically regulate a rat's pudendal nerve for selective nerve stimulation and blocking. under this experimental design, a series of in vivo animal experiments were conducted on anesthetized rats, including the computational characterization of biosignals, the development of an intermittent high-frequency blocking current waveform for blocking the nerve, and verification of the control strategy. results show that the ivp-feedback control strategy for dual-channel pudendal neuromodulation performed well in animal experiments and could be utilized to selectively stimulate and block the pudendal nerve to augment bladder contraction and restore external urethral sphincter bursting activity to improve bladder emptying. this study demonstrates the feasibility of the ivp-based feedback-control strategy with animal experiments. the results could provide a basis for developing a sophisticated neural prosthesis for restoring bladder function in clinical use or for neurophysiological study.
foraging honeybees are likely to learn visual and chemical cues associated with many different food sources. here, we explore how many such sources can be memorized and recalled. marked bees were trained to visit two (or three) sugar feeders, each placed at a different outdoor location and carrying a different scent. we then tested the ability of the bees to recall these locations and fly to them, when the training scents were blown into the hive, and the scents and food at the feeders were removed. when trained on two feeder locations, each associated with a different scent, the bees could correctly recall the location associated with each scent. however, this ability broke down when the number of scents and feeder locations was increased to three. performance was partially restored when each of the three training feeders was endowed with an additional cue, namely, a distinct colour. our results suggest that bees can recall a maximum of two locations when each is associated with a different scent. however, this number can be increased if the scent cues are augmented by visual cues. these findings have implications for the ways in which associations are established and laid down in honeybee memory. poor fetal growth is linked with long-term detrimental effects on health in adulthood. here we investigate whether the lifespan of male mice is affected by their growth rate when they were suckling and find that limiting growth during that period not only increases longevity but also protects against the life-shortening effect of an obesity-inducing diet later on. by contrast, we find that lifespan is considerably shortened if the postnatal period of growth is accelerated to make up for reduced growth in utero, and that, in addition, these mice are susceptible to the adverse effects on longevity of an obesity-inducing diet after weaning.
although physical activity (pa) has been inversely associated with depressive symptoms, it is not clear whether regular pa and television watching are associated with clinical depression risk. the authors conducted a prospective analysis involving 49,821 us women from the nurses' health study who were free from depressive symptoms at baseline (1996). information on pa was obtained from validated questionnaires completed in 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, and 2000; analyses were conducted using the cumulative average of pa (minutes/day) with a 2-year latency period applied. participants were asked about television-watching habits in 1992. cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for multiple risk factors were used to estimate relative risks of clinical depression (self-reported physician-diagnosed depression or use of antidepressants). during 10 years of follow-up (1996-2006), 6,505 incident cases of depression were documented. higher levels of pa were associated with lower depression risk. the multivariate relative risk comparing the highest level of pa (≥ 90 minutes/day) with the lowest (<10 minutes/day) was 0.80 (95% confidence interval: 0.70, 0.92; p(trend) < 0.001). in contrast, the risk of depression increased with increasing television-watching time. the multivariate relative risk comparing women who spent 21 hours/week or more watching television with those who spent 0-1 hour/week was 1.13 (95% confidence interval: 1.00, 1.27; p(trend) = 0.01). analyses simultaneously considering pa and television watching suggested that both contributed independently to depression risk. background: a growing body of evidence suggests that physical activity might reduce the risk of depressive symptoms, but there are limited data on black women.purpose: the objective was to evaluate the association between leisure time physical activity and depressive symptoms in u.s. black women.methods: participants included 35,224 women ages 21 to 69 from the blackwomen’s health study, a follow-up study of african american women in which data are collected biennially by mail questionnaire.women answered questions on past and current exercise levels at baseline (1995) and follow-up (1997). the center for epidemiologic studies depression scale (ces-d) was used to measure depressive symptoms in 1999. women who reported a diagnosis of depression before 1999 were excluded. we used multivariate logistic regression models to compute odds ratios (ors) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) for physical activity in relation to depressive symptoms (ces-d score <= 16) with control for potential confounders.results: adult vigorous physical activity was inversely associated with depressive symptoms. women who reported vigorous exercise both in high school (<= 5 hr per week) and adulthood (<= 2 hr per week) had the lowest odds of depressive symptoms (or = 0.76, 95% ci = 0.71−0.82) relative to never active women; the or was 0.90 for women who were active in high school but not adulthood (95% ci = 0.85-0.96) and 0.83 for women who were inactive in high school but became active in adulthood (95% ci = 0.77-0.91). although walking for exercise was not associated with risk of depressive symptoms overall, there was evidence of a weak inverse relation among obese women (body mass index <= 30).conclusions: leisure time vigorous physical activity was associated with a reduced odds of depressive symptoms in u.s. black women.
this study was designed to study effects of lung lavage versus the classical bolus instillation with a peptide‐based synthetic surfactant (lucinactant) in a model of meconium aspiration syndrome (mas). eighteen newborn lambs received meconium and were randomized to: the experimental meconium installation (emas) group—lambs with emas kept on conventional mechanical ventilation (control); the sf‐bolus group—emas receiving a lucinactant bolus (30 mg/ml); or the d‐sf‐lavage group—emas treated with dilute lucinactant bronchoalveolar lavage (10 mg/ml). systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures, blood gases, and pulmonary mechanics were recorded for 180 min. in addition, the intrapulmonary distribution of the lucinactant was determined using dye‐labeled microspheres. following meconium instillation, severe hypoxia, hypercapnia, acidosis, and pulmonary hypertension developed, and dynamic compliance decreased (50% from baseline). after lung lavage with dilute lucinactant, gas exchange significantly improved versus bolus instillation (p < 0.05). further, only in the lavage group did pulmonary arterial pressure return to basal values and dynamic compliance significantly increased. both lung lavage and bolus techniques for the administration of lucinactant resulted in a non‐uniform lung distribution. in conclusion, in newborn lambs with respiratory failure and pulmonary hypertension induced by meconium, lung lavage with dilute lucinactant seems to be an effective and safe alternative for treatment for mas. pediatr. pulmonol. 2011; 46:991–999. © 2011 wiley‐liss, inc. background. animal-derived, protein-containing surfactants seem to be superior to protein-free surfactants. lucinactant, a synthetic surfactant containing a surfactant protein-b peptide analog, has been shown to be effective in animal models and phase ii clinical trials. to date, lucinactant has not been compared with an animal-derived surfactant in a premature animal model. objective. the objective was to compare the acute and sustained effects of lucinactant among premature lambs with respiratory distress syndrome (rds) with the effects of a natural porcine surfactant (poractant-α). methods. after 5 minutes of mechanical ventilation twin premature lambs were assigned randomly to the lucinactant group (30 mg/ml, 5.8 ml/kg) or the poractant-α group (80 mg/ml, 2.2 ml/kg). heart rate, systemic arterial pressure, arterial ph, blood gas values, and lung mechanics were recorded for 12 hours. results. baseline fetal ph values were similar for the 2 groups (ph 7.27). after 5 minutes of mechanical ventilation, severe rds developed (ph: <7.08; paco2: >80 mm hg; pao2: <40 mm hg; dynamic compliance: <0.08 ml/cm h2o per kg). after surfactant instillation, similar improvements in gas exchange and lung mechanics were observed for the lucinactant and poractant-α groups at 1 hour (ph: 7.3 ± 0.1 vs 7.4 ± 0.1; paco2: 8 ± 18 mm hg vs 40 ± 8 mm hg; pao2: 167 ± 52 mm hg vs 259 ± 51 mm hg; dynamic compliance: 0.3 ± 0.1 ml/cm h2o per kg vs 0.3 ± 0.1 ml/cm h2o per kg). the improvements in lung function were sustained, with no differences between groups. cardiovascular profiles remained stable in both groups. conclusions. among preterm lambs with severe rds, lucinactant produced improvements in gas exchange and lung mechanics similar to those observed with a porcine-derived surfactant.
growing evidence indicates that alterations of neuroplasticity may contribute to the pathophysiology of depression. in contrast, various antidepressants increase adult hippocampal neurogenesis and block the effects of stress. these findings result in the ‘neurogenesis hypothesis of depression’. the present study seeks to determine out whether cell proliferation is altered in the hippocampus, subventricular zone (svz), and basolateral amygdala of adult rats exposed to bilateral olfactory bulbectomy, another established model of depression and, if so, how imipramine effects bulbectomy-induced changes of cell genesis. bulbectomy results in a significant reduction of cell proliferation in the hippocampus and svz, an effect that is normalized by subchronic doses of imipramine. moreover, an increase in cell genesis in the basolateral amygdala, which is not affected by imipramine, is demonstrated. tunel staining indicates an enhanced apoptosis after bulbectomy in the svz that cannot be reduced by imipramine. cell death rates in the hippocampus and amygdala are not affected by bulbectomy. the opposing effects of bulbectomy and imipramine treatment in the hippocampus and amygdala demonstrate that these structures of the limbic system, both integrated in emotional processing, react quite differently with regard to neuroplasticity. further to this, we discuss a possible link between the pathogenesis of depression and changed neuronal plasticity in the svz. the main olfactory bulb (mob) is the first relay on the olfactory sensory pathway and the target of the neural progenitor cells generated in the subventricular zone (svz) lining the lateral ventricles and which migrate along the rostral extension of the svz, also called the rostral migratory stream (rms). within the mob, the neuroblasts differentiate into granular and periglomerular interneurons. a reduction in the number of granule cells during sensory deprivation suggests that neurogenesis may be influenced by afferent activity. here, we show that unilateral sensory deafferentation of the mob by axotomy of the olfactory receptor neurons increases apoptotic cell death in the svz and along the rostro-caudal extent of the rms. the vast majority of dying cells in the rms are migrating neuroblasts as indicated by double terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated utp nick-end labeling/psa-ncam labeling. counting bromodeoxyuridine-labeled cells in animals killed immediately or 4 days after tracer administration showed a bilateral increase in proliferation in the svz and rms which was balanced by cell death on the operated side. these data suggest that olfactory inputs are required for the survival of newborn neural progenitors. the greatest enhancement in proliferation occurred in the extension of the rms located in the mob, revealing a population of local precursors mitotically stimulated following axotomy. together, these findings indicate that olfactory inputs may strongly modulate the balance between neurogenesis and apoptosis in the svz and rms and provide a model for further investigation of the underlying molecular mechanisms of this activity-dependent neuronal plasticity.
the chemical shifts measured in solution-state and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) are powerful probes of the structure and dynamics of protein molecules. the exploitation of chemical shifts requires methods to correlate these data with the protein structures and sequences. we present here an approach to calculate accurate chemical shifts in both ordered and disordered proteins using exclusively the information contained in their sequences. our sequence-based approach, protein sequences and chemical shift correlations (prosecco), achieves the accuracy of the most advanced structure-based methods in the characterization of chemical shifts of folded proteins and improves the state of the art in the study of disordered proteins. our analyses revealed fundamental insights on the structural information carried by nmr chemical shifts of structured and unstructured protein states. nmr chemical shifts provide important local structural information for proteins and are key in recently described protein structure generation protocols. we describe a new chemical shift prediction program, sparta+, which is based on artificial neural networking. the neural network is trained on a large carefully pruned database, containing 580 proteins for which high-resolution x-ray structures and nearly complete backbone and 13cβ chemical shifts are available. the neural network is trained to establish quantitative relations between chemical shifts and protein structures, including backbone and side-chain conformation, h-bonding, electric fields and ring-current effects. the trained neural network yields rapid chemical shift prediction for backbone and 13cβ atoms, with standard deviations of 2.45, 1.09, 0.94, 1.14, 0.25 and 0.49 ppm for δ15n, δ13c’, δ13cα, δ13cβ, δ1hα and δ1hn, respectively, between the sparta+ predicted and experimental shifts for a set of eleven validation proteins. these results represent a modest but consistent improvement (2–10%) over the best programs available to date, and appear to be approaching the limit at which empirical approaches can predict chemical shifts.
objective to study the relationship and changes of cervical mri, tcd and baep in patients with "isolated" vertigo.   methods the relationship and changes of cervical mri, tcd and baep were investigated respectively in 125 patients with "isolated" vertigo and 100 healthy controls.   results there were statistically significant differences between two groups for overall abnormalities of tcd (x(2) = 61.96, p<0.01), baep (x(2) = 97.99, p<0.01), and cervical mri severity scale (z = -8.71, p<0.01). in vertigo group, results showed significant correlations between tcd and cervical mri, tcd and baep as well. and analysis on tcd pi and some items of baep demonstrated positive linear correlations. there were no statistical differences or correlations in control group.   conclusions tcd is a sensitive method of "isolated" vertigo screening. a combined test protocol of cervical mri, tcd and baep has superiorities to assess "isolated" vertigo. abstract objectives: vertigo can be a manifestation of underlying vertebrobasilar stroke in older adults. the study objectives were to investigate the correlation, sensitivity, and specificity of the auditory brainstem response (abr), electronystagmorgraphy (eng), and transcranial doppler (tcd) collectively to distinguish between vertigo due to vertebrobasilar insufficiency (vbi) and vertigo due to non-vbi. design: prospective experimental study comparing eng, abr, and tcd battery findings between two groups of patients with vertigo and a control group. study sample: participants included 14 patients with vertigo of vbi origin, 14 patients with vertigo of non-vbi, and 11 matched controls. results: participants with vbi had more abnormal findings in the eng (86%), tcd (72%), and abr (64%) compared to the non-vbi group (64%, 21%, and 7%, respectively) and the control group. the combined battery revealed positive correlations, 64% sensitivity, and 84% positive predictive value (ppv) in the vbi group, and 100% specificity with lack of correlations in the non-vbi group. conclusions: the modest sensitivity and ppv helps with early detection of vbi, thus preventing risk of vertebrobasilar stroke in 84% to 64% of patients. the 100% specificity in the non-vbi group rules out vbi, thus reducing the referral rate for unnecessary, diagnostic evaluations and ineffective treatment.
objective pulmonary hypertension (ph) is characterized with pulmonary vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling mediated by 15-lipoxygenase (15-lo)/15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-hete) according to our previous studies. meanwhile, telomerase reverse transcriptase (tert) activity is highly correlated with vascular injury and remodeling, suggesting that tert may be an essential determinant in the development of ph. the aim of this study was to determine the contribution and molecular mechanisms of tert in the pathogenesis of ph. approach and results we measured the right ventricular systolic pressure (rvsp) and ventricular weight, analyzed morphometric change of the pulmonary vessels in the hypoxia or monocrotaline treated rats. bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, transwell assay and flow cytometry in pulmonary smooth muscle cells were performed to investigate the roles and relationship of tert and 15-lo/15-hete in ph. we revealed that the expression of tert was increased in pulmonary vasculature of patients with ph and in the monocrotaline or hypoxia rat model of ph. the up-regulation of tert was associated with experimental elevated rvsp and pulmonary vascular remodeling. coimmunoprecipitation experiments identified tert as a novel interacting partner of 15-lo-2. tert and 15-lo-2 augmented protein expression of each other. in addition, the proliferation, migration and cell-cycle transition from g0/g1 phase to s phase induced by hypoxia were inhibited by tert knockdown, which were rescued by 15-hete addition. conclusions these results demonstrate that tert regulates pulmonary vascular remodeling. tert and 15-lo-2 form a positive feedback loop and together promote proliferation and migration of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, creating a self-amplifying circuit which propels pulmonary hypertension. telomere and telomerase alterations have been reported in mood disorders. however, the role of telomerase in depression remains unclear. here we show that chronic mild stress (cms) led to a significant decrease in telomerase reverse transcriptase (tert) level and telomerase activity in the hippocampus. treatment with antidepressant fluoxetine reversed the cms-induced tert and telomerase activity changes. inhibiting telomerase by systemic administration (100 mg · kg−1 · d−1, i.p., for 14 d), intrahippocampal microinjection (0.7 μmol, 2 μl), or infusion (using an osmotic minipump, 0.134 μg/μl, 0.25 μl/h) of 3′-azido-deoxythymidine (azt) resulted in depression-like behaviors and impaired hippocampal neurogenesis in mice. in contrast, overexpressing telomerase by intrahippocampal infusion of recombinant adenovirus vector expressing mouse tert (ad-mtert-gfp) led to neurogenesis upregulation, produced antidepressant-like behaviors, and prevented the cms-induced behavioral modifications. disrupting neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus by x-irradiation (15 gy) of a restricted region of mouse brain containing the hippocampus abolished the antidepressant-like effect of ad-mtert-gfp. additionally, azt had no effect on dna polymerase activity and did not cause cell damage in vitro and in vivo. microinjection of azt into the subventricular zone of lateral ventricle (0.7 μmol, 2 μl) inhibited local neurogenesis but had no behavioral effect. these results suggest that hippocampal telomerase is involved in the modulation of depression-related behaviors, possibly by regulating adult neurogenesis.
backgroundin previous studies, female monkeys self-administered more oral phencyclidine (pcp) than males, and pcp intake differed by phase of menstrual cycle.objectivesthe purpose of this study was to examine sex and hormonal influences on oral cocaine self-administration in male and female rhesus monkeys in the follicular vs. luteal phases of the menstrual cycle, with concurrent access to an alternative nondrug reward, saccharin (sacc) vs. water.materials and methodsconcurrent access to cocaine (0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mg/ml) and sacc or water was available from two drinking spouts under concurrent fixed-ratio (fr) 2, 4, and 8 schedules during daily 3-h sessions.resultscocaine deliveries were similar in males and females in the females’ luteal phase, but cocaine deliveries were higher in females during the follicular phase than the luteal phase and compared to males. when sacc was available, cocaine deliveries were reduced in females in the follicular phase of the cycle, and cocaine intake (mg/kg) was reduced in males and in females’ follicular and luteal phases.conclusionsaccess to concurrent sacc (vs. water) reduced cocaine intake (mg/kg) in males and in females during both menstrual phases, and the magnitude of the reduction in cocaine intake was greatest during the females’ follicular phase. thus, a nondrug alternative reward, sacc, is a viable alternative treatment for reducing cocaine’s rewarding effects on male and female monkeys, and reductions in cocaine seeking were optimal in the females’ luteal phase. substantive evidence indicates that there are sex differences in the reinforcing effects of drugs, and gonadal steroid hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone, likely contribute to these differences. among females, subjective effects of drugs differ as a function of menstrual cycle phase. the purpose of the present study was to compare oral self-administration of phencyclidine (pcp) in female rhesus monkeys (macaca mulatta) across different phases of the menstrual cycle. since the 28-day menstrual cycle of non-human primates is similar to that of humans, this model could provide important evidence supporting the implication that changes in the levels of gonadal hormones across menstrual phase can alter a drug's reinforcing effects. oral self-administration of several concentrations of pcp (0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/ml) was examined in three sexually mature female monkeys during 3-h experimental sessions. menstrual cycle phase was determined by onset of menses and verified by examining vaginal cytology. pcp self-administration was greater during the luteal phase at the 0.125 and 0.25 mg/ml concentrations, which is normally characterized by high levels of progesterone and moderate levels of estrogen, than during the follicular phase, when levels of estrogen are increasing and progesterone levels are low. when examined within each phase, numbers of pcp deliveries were highest during the mid-luteal phase, compared to the early and mid-follicular phases. no differences in self-administration were observed between early and mid-follicular phases, but a significant difference in pcp deliveries was found between mid- and late luteal phases at the lowest concentration of pcp tested. the results from this study suggest that pcp's reinforcing effects in female monkeys differ as a function of menstrual cycle phase.
background despite the large number of treatments available for bipolar disorder (bd), more than one half of patients have a recurrence within 2 years, and over 90% experience at least one additional affective episode during their lifetime.   methods the aim of this study was to test the impact of a number of demographic and clinical features on the risk to recurrence in a real- word representative sample of 266 outpatients with bd-i or ii treated in a naturalistic setting during a 4-years-follow-up period.   results we found that the number of episodes per year after study entry, compared to the number of episodes per year before study entry,significantly decreased and that about one third of patients had no recurrences during the observation period. the length of follow-up and the number of previous episodes, mainly depressive, predicted the risk of recurrence, while female gender, higher age at intake, and a higher frequency of past mixed episodes predicted a higher frequency of recurrences.   limitations the study had some limitations to consider: i.e. the risk of poor reliability of information on the previous course of illness or the naturalistic treatment during the follow-up.   conclusions our study suggests that (a) an evidence-based long-term treatment, with regular follow-up visits could improve the course of disease and prognosis; (b) clinicians should carefully consider the presence of a high number of mixed episodes, to provide more targeted treatment strategies; (c) an appropriate use of antidepressants in selected patients did not worsen the course of illness. backgroundfew studies of the time to remission and first relapse in severe bipolar disorder have been based on epidemiologically defined samples or have examined patient characteristics and time-varying indicators of medication use simultaneously. using a cohort from the suffolk county mental health project, we describe these temporal patterns and their relationships with childhood, illness, and treatment characteristics.methoda multi-facility cohort of 123 first-admission inpatients with dsm-iv bipolar disorder with psychotic features was followed for 4 years. dates of the first complete remission (lasting at least 2 months), subsequent relapses, and use of antimanic (am),antipsychotic (ap), and antidepressant (ad) medications were recorded. childhood and illness characteristics were ascertained at baseline using standard instruments.resultsby the 4-year point, 83.7% had achieved a full remission, with 42.3% remitting within 3 months, 63.4% within 6 months, and 74.8% within 1 year. overall, younger age of onset, history of childhood psychopathology, and higher brief psychiatric rating scale (bprs) anxiety/depression scores were significantly associated with longer time to remission. discontinuing am, ap and ad (compared to never using) and taking ap and ad (compared to never using) were significantly associated with remission in the multivariate analysis. of the 103 participants with complete remission, 61.2% suffered a relapse; 24.3 % relapsed within 6 months of remission, and 35.9% within a year. overall, 32.5% of the 123 participants had a single episode followed by full remission. childhood internalizing-type problems, higher bprs anxiety/depression and hamilton depression scores, and an admission episode not involving mania, but not patterns of medication use, were associated with shorter time to relapse.conclusionby 4-year follow-up, the majority of severely ill bipolar patients had remitted from their initial episode, but more than half subsequently relapsed. illness characteristics, especially depressive symptoms, and medication treatment were associated with the early course, although medication use after remission was not associated with relapse.
abstract overgeneral autobiographical memory (abm) disclosure has been established as a key cognitive marker of clinical depression in experimental research studies. to determine the ecological validity of these findings for psychotherapy treatments of depression, the present study investigated the relationship between change in level of depression and abm specificity in the context of early, middle, and late therapy session transcripts selected from 34 clients undergoing emotion-focused therapy and client-centered therapy in the york i depression study. a hierarchical linear modeling analysis demonstrated that clients disclosed significantly more specific abms over the course of therapy. there were no differences in abm specificity between treatment groups. there was also no evidence that increased specificity differentiated between recovered and unchanged clients at treatment termination. previous research on depressed and suicidal patients and those with posttraumatic stress disorder has shown that patients' memory for the past is overgeneral (i.e., patients retrieve generic summaries of past events rather than specific events). this study investigated whether autobiographical memory could be affected by psychological treatment. recovered depressed patients were randomly allocated to receive either treatment as usual or treatment designed to reduce risk of relapse. whereas control patients showed no change in specificity of memories recalled in response to cue words, the treatment group showed a significantly reduced number of generic memories. although such a memory deficit may arise from long-standing tendencies to encode and retrieve events generically, such a style is open to modification.
early‐onset bipolar (bp) disorder and other poor prognosis characteristics are more prevalent in patients from the united states than from the netherlands and germany (abbreviated as europe). we explored the impact of parental loading for affective illness on onset and other characteristics of bp disorder. objective: to compare the prevalence rates of mental disorders among children of parents with bipolar disorder and of parents with no mental disorders. method: seventeen studies, meeting specific selection criteria, were included in the metaanalyses. risks for mental disorders among children were estimated by aggregating raw data from the selected studies. results: results indicate that in comparison with children of parents with no mental disorders, children of parents with bipolar disorder are 2.7 times more likely to develop any mental disorder and 4.0 times more likely to develop an affective disorder. the metaanalyses indicate that during childhood and adolescence, the risks for any mental disorder and for affective disorders in children are consistently but moderately related to having a parent who suffers from bipolar disorder. conclusions: risk factors that could account for the psychopathology observed in children of bipolar parents are explored.
abstractwhile it is known that certain pathologies may impact on left–right symmetry of gait, little is known about the mechanisms that contribute to gait symmetry or how high in the hierarchy of the control of gait symmetry is regulated in humans. to assess the contribution of cognitive function to gait symmetry, we measured gait asymmetry (ga) in three subject groups, patients with parkinson’s disease (pd, n = 21), idiopathic elderly fallers (n = 15), and healthy elderly controls (n = 11). all subjects walked under two walking conditions: usual walking and dual tasking (cognitive loading) condition. for each subject, the swing time (sw) was calculated and averaged across strides for the left and right feet (swl and swr). ga was defined as:   $$ 100 \times {\left| {\ln ({\text{swr}}/{\text{swl}})} \right|.} $$ for both the pd patients and the elderly fallers ga values were significantly higher during the usual walking condition, as compared with the control group (p < 0.01). in addition, for both the pd patients and the elderly fallers, ga significantly increased when they walked and performed a dual task, compared with the usual walking condition (p < 0.003). in contrast, dual tasking did not affect the ga of the healthy controls (p = 0.518). ga was associated with gait speed and gait variability, but no correlations were found between ga and the asymmetry of the classic pd motor symptoms. thus, the results suggest that the ability to generate a steady, rhythmic walk with a bilaterally coordinated gait does not rely heavily on mental attention and cognitive resources in healthy older adults. in contrast, however, when gait becomes impaired and less automatic, ga apparently relies on cognitive input and attention. cognitive function and the performance of a secondary, dual task may affect certain aspects of gait, but the relationships between cognitive function and gait are not well understood. to better understand the motor control of gait and the relationship between cognitive function and gait, we studied cognitive function and the effects of different types of dual tasking on the gait of patients with parkinson's disease (pd) and controls, contrasting measures of gait automaticity and rhythmicity with other features. patients with idiopathic pd (n = 30; mean age 71.8 year) with moderate disease severity (hoehn and yahr stage 2–3) were compared to age and gender‐matched healthy controls (n = 28). memory and executive function were also assessed. in both groups, gait speed decreased in response to dual tasking, in a parallel fashion. for the pd group only, gait variability increased compared to usual walking. executive function was significantly worse in the pd group, while memory was not different in the two groups. executive function measures were significantly correlated with gait variability during dual tasking, but not during usual walking. these findings demonstrate that regulation of gait variability and rhythmicity is apparently an automatic process that does not demand attention in healthy adults. in patients with pd, however, this ability becomes attention‐demanding and worsens when subjects perform secondary tasks. moreover, the associations between executive function and gait variability suggest that a decline in executive function in pd may exacerbate the effects of dual tasking on gait, potentially increasing fall risk.
background and aims exposure to air pollution has been linked to total and cardiopulmonary mortality. however, few studies have examined the effects of exposure over decades, or which time windows of long term exposure are most relevant. we investigated the long term effects of residential air pollution on total and cause-specific mortality and incidence of myocardial infarction in a well-characterized cohort of men in sweden.   methods a cohort of 7494 men in gothenburg was examined in 1970-1973 and followed subsequently to determine predictors of cardiovascular disease. we collected data on residential address and cause-specific mortality for the years 1973-2007. each individual was assigned yearly nitrogen oxides (nox) exposure based on dispersion models. using multivariable cox regression and generalized additive models with time-dependent exposure, we studied the association between three different time windows of residential nox exposure, and selected outcomes.   results in the years 1973-2007, a total of 5669 deaths, almost half of which were due to cardiovascular diseases, occurred in the cohort. levels of nox exposure decreased during the study period, from a median of 38 µg/m(3) in 1973 to 17 µg/m(3) in 2007. total non-accidental mortality was associated with participants' nox exposure in the last year (the year of outcome) (hr 1.03, 95% ci 1.01-1.05, per 10 µg/m(3)), with the mean nox exposure during the last 5 years, and with the mean nox exposure since enrolment (hr 1.02, 95% ci 1.01-1.04 for both). the associations were similar (hr 1.01-1.03), but generally not statistically significant, for cardiovascular, ischemic heart disease, and acute myocardial infarction mortality, and weaker for cerebrovascular and respiratory mortality. there was no association between nox exposure and incident myocardial infarction.   discussion and conclusions long term residential exposure to nox at these relatively low exposure levels in gothenburg was associated with total non-accidental mortality. the association was as strong for nox exposure in the last year as for longer exposure windows. the effect was near linear, and only marginally affected by confounders and effect modifiers. the improved air quality in gothenburg has by these estimates led to a 6% decrease in excess non-accidental mortality during the study period. background: the association of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular outcomes with air pollution exposures has been well established in the literature. the number of studies examining chronic exposures in cohorts is growing, with more recent studies conducted among women finding risk estimates of greater magnitude. questions remain regarding sex differences in the relationship of chronic particulate matter (pm) exposures with mortality and cardiovascular outcomes. objectives: in this study we explored these associations in the all-male health professionals follow-up study prospective cohort. methods: the same spatiotemporal exposure estimation models, similar outcomes, and biennially updated covariates were used as those previously applied in the female nurses’ health study cohort. results: among 17,545 men residing in the northeastern and midwestern united states, there were 2,813 deaths, including 746 cases of fatal coronary heart disease (chd). an interquartile range change (4 µg/m3) in average exposure to pm ≤ 2.5 µm in diameter in the 12 previous months was not associated with all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (hr) = 0.94; 95% confidence interval (ci), 0.87–1.00] or fatal chd (hr = 0.99; 95% ci, 0.87–1.13) in fully adjusted models. findings were similar for separate models of exposure to pm ≤ 10 µm in diameter and pm between 2.5 and 10 µm in diameter and for copollutant models. conclusions: among this cohort of men with high socioeconomic status living in the midwestern and northeastern united states, the results did not support an association of chronic pm exposures with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in models with time-varying covariates. whether these findings suggest sex differences in susceptibility or the protective impact of healthier lifestyles and higher socioeconomic status requires additional investigation.
background japanese encephalitis virus (jev), a member of the flaviviridae family, causes around 68,000 encephalitis cases annually, of which 20–30% are fatal, while 30–50% of the recovered cases develop severe neurological sequelae. specific antivirals for jev would be of great importance, particularly in those cases where the infection has become persistent. being indispensable for flaviviral replication, the ns2b-ns3 protease is a promising target for design of anti-flaviviral inhibitors. contrary to related flaviviral proteases, the jev ns2b-ns3 protease is structurally and mechanistically much less characterized. here we aimed at establishing a straightforward procedure for cloning, expression, purification and biochemical characterization of jev ns2b(h)-ns3pro protease. methodology/principal findings the full-length sequence of jev ns2b-ns3 genotype iii strain jaoars 982 was obtained as a synthetic gene. the sequence of ns2b(h)-ns3pro was generated by splicing by overlap extension pcr (soe-pcr) and cloned into the ptrchisa vector. hexahistidine-tagged ns2b(h)-ns3pro, expressed in e. coli as soluble protein, was purified to >95% purity by a single-step immobilized metal affinity chromatography. sds-page and immunoblotting of the purified enzyme demonstrated ns2b(h)-ns3pro precursor and its autocleavage products, ns3pro and ns2b(h), as 36, 21, and 10 kda bands, respectively. kinetic parameters, k m and k cat, for fluorogenic protease model substrates, boc-grr-amc, boc-lrr-amc, ac-nkrr-amc, bz-nkrr-amc, pyr-rtkr-amc and abz-(r)4sag-ny-amide, were obtained using inner filter effect correction. the highest catalytic efficiency k cat /k m was found for pyr-rtkr-amc (k cat/k m: 1962.96±85.0 m−1 s−1) and the lowest for boc-lrr-amc (k cat/k m: 3.74±0.3 m−1 s−1). jev ns3pro is inhibited by aprotinin but to a lesser extent than den and wnv ns3pro. conclusions/significance a simplified procedure for the cloning, overexpression and purification of the ns2b(h)-ns3pro was established which is generally applicable to other flaviviral proteases. kinetic parameters obtained for a number of model substrates and inhibitors, are useful for the characterization of substrate specificity and eventually for the design of high-throughput assays aimed at antiviral inhibitor discovery. the ns3 (dengue virus non-structural protein 3) serine protease of dengue virus is an essential component for virus maturation, thus representing an attractive target for the development of antiviral drugs directed at the inhibition of polyprotein processing. in the present study, we have investigated determinants of substrate specificity of the dengue virus ns3 protease by using internally quenched fluorogenic peptides containing abz (o-aminobenzoic acid; synonymous to anthranilic acid) and 3-nitrotyrosine (ny) representing both native and chimaeric polyprotein cleavage site sequences. by using this combinatorial approach, we were able to describe the substrate preferences and determinants of specificity for the dengue virus ns2b(h)-ns3pro protease. kinetic parameters (kcat/k(m)) for the hydrolysis of peptide substrates with systematic truncations at the prime and non-prime side revealed a length preference for peptides spanning the p4-p3' residues, and the peptide abz-rrrrsagny-amide based on the dengue virus capsid protein processing site was discovered as a novel and efficient substrate of the ns3 protease (kcat/k(m)=11087 m(-1) x s(-1)). thus, while having confirmed the exclusive preference of the ns3 protease for basic residues at the p1 and p2 positions, we have also shown that the presence of basic amino acids at the p3 and p4 positions is a major specificity-determining feature of the dengue virus ns3 protease. investigation of the substrate peptide abz-kkqragvlny-amide based on the ns2b/ns3 polyprotein cleavage site demonstrated an unexpected high degree of cleavage efficiency. chimaeric peptides with combinations of prime and non-prime sequences spanning the p4-p4' positions of all five native polyprotein cleavage sites revealed a preponderant effect of non-prime side residues on the k(m) values, whereas variations at the prime side sequences had higher impact on kcat.
to identify regions involved in tissue specific regulation of transcription of the alpha1(vi) collagen chain, transgenic mice were generated carrying various portions of the gene's 5'-flanking sequence fused to the e. coli beta-galactosidase gene. analysis of the transgene expression pattern by x-gal staining of embryos revealed that: (a) the proximal 0.6 kb of promoter sequence activated transcription in mesenchymal cells at sites of insertion of superficial muscular aponeurosis into the skin; tendons were also faintly positive. (b) the region between -4.0 and -5.4 kb from the transcription start site was required for activation of the transgene in nerves. it also drove expression in joints, in intervertebral disks, and in subepidermal and vibrissae mesenchyme. (c) the fragment comprised within -6.2 and -7.5 kb was necessary for high level transcription in skeletal muscle and meninges. positive cells in muscle were mostly mononuclear and probably included connective tissue elements, although staining of myoblasts was not ruled out. this fragment also activated expression in joints, in intervertebral disks, and in subepidermal and vibrissae mesenchyme. (d) beta-galactosidase staining in vibrissae induced by the sequences -4.0 to -5.4 and -6.2 to -7.5 was not coincident: with the latter sequence labeled nuclei were found mainly in the ventral and posterior quadrant, and, histologically, in the outer layers of mesenchyme surrounding and between the follicles, whereas with the former the remaining quadrants were positive and expressing cells were mostly in the inner layers of the dermal sheath. (e) other tissues, notably lung, adrenal gland, digestive tract, which produce high amounts of collagen type vi, did not stain for beta-galactosidase. (f) central nervous system and retina, in which the endogenous gene is inactive, expressed the lacz transgene in most lines. the data suggest that transcription of alpha1(vi) in different tissues is regulated by distinct sequence elements in a modular arrangement, a mechanism which confers high flexibility in the temporal and spatial pattern of expression during development. the expression of type vi collagen has been studied in mouse tissues. by northern blotting, the mrna for the alpha 1 (vi) chain was detectable in whole embryos at 10.5 days postcoitum and steeply increased afterward. the messenger levels were high at birth, but decreased rapidly in the following days, reaching low levels in adult animals. in 2-month-old mice, lung, skin, adrenal gland, heart, skeletal muscle and tail and fat were among the most active producers of alpha 1 (vi) mrna. in situ hybridization first identified mrna for alpha 1 (vi) collagen in mesenchymal cells of 10.5-day embryos in various locations, including serosae, branchial arches, large blood vessels and the cephalic mesenchyme. staining increased at later stages of development and most connective tissues were positive at 16.5 days and later. strongly staining tissues were joints, intervertebral disks, perichondrium, periostium, dermis, skeletal muscle and heart valves, whereas cartilage and bone were very poorly labelled. epithelia and the central nervous system were completely negative. in several organs, notably lung, salivary glands and the digestive tract, staining was concentrated underneath epithelia. this staining pattern was different from that for collagen type i, which was evenly distributed in the subepithelial mesenchyme. the pattern of distribution of the protein, revealed by immunocytochemistry, was coincident with that of the alpha 1 (vi) mrna. in addition, the results confirmed that type vi collagen is preferentially deposited in the pericellular environment. this was particularly evident in skeletal muscle. the data show that type vi collagen is mainly produced by mesenchymal cells and suggest a role for the protein in delineating the boundary of distinct domains in connective tissue.
backgroundv(d)j recombination is initiated in antigen receptor loci by the pairwise cleavage of recombination signal sequences (rsss) by the rag1 and rag2 proteins via a nick-hairpin mechanism. the rss contains highly conserved heptamer (consensus: 5'-cacagtg) and nonamer (consensus: 5'-acaaaaacc) motifs separated by either 12- or 23-base pairs of poorly conserved sequence. the high mobility group proteins hmgb1 and hmgb2 (hmgb1/2) are highly abundant architectural dna binding proteins known to promote rag-mediated synapsis and cleavage of consensus recombination signals in vitro by facilitating rss binding and bending by the rag1/2 complex. hmgb1/2 are known to recognize distorted dna structures such as four-way junctions, and damaged or modified dna. whether hmgb1/2 can promote rag-mediated dna cleavage at sites lacking a canonical rss by targeting or stabilizing structural distortions is unclear, but is important for understanding the etiology of chromosomal translocations involving antigen receptor genes and proto-oncogene sequences that do not contain an obvious rss-like element.resultshere we identify a novel dna breakpoint site in the plasmid v(d)j recombination substrate pgg49 (bps6197) that is cleaved by the rag proteins via a nick-hairpin mechanism. the bps6197 sequence lacks a recognizable heptamer at the breakpoint (5'-cctgacg-3') but contains a nonamer-like element (5'-acattaacc-3') 30 base pairs from the cleavage site. we find that rag-mediated bps6197 cleavage is promoted by hmgb1/2, requiring both hmg-box domains to be intact to facilitate rag-mediated cleavage, and is stimulated by synapsis with a 12-rss. a dyad-symmetric inverted repeat sequence lying 5' to the breakpoint is implicated as a target for hmgb1/2 activity.conclusionwe have identified a novel dna sequence, called bps6197, that supports standard v(d)j-type cleavage despite the absence of an apparent heptamer motif. efficient rag-mediated bps6197 cleavage requires the presence of hmgb1/2, is stimulated by synapsis with a 12-rss partner, and is directed in part by an inverted repeat sequence adjacent to the dna cleavage site. these results have important implications for understanding how the rag proteins can introduce a dna double-strand break at dna sequences that do not contain an obvious heptamer-like motif. v(d)j recombination is a process integral to lymphocyte development. however, this process is not always benign, since certain lymphoid malignancies exhibit recurrent chromosomal abnormalities, such as translocations and deletions, that harbor molecular signatures suggesting an origin from aberrant v(d)j recombination. translocations involving lmo2, tal1, ttg-1, and hox11, as well as a recurrent interstitial deletion at 1p32 involving sil/scl, are cited examples of illegitimate v(d)j recombination. previous studies using extrachromosomal substrates reveal that cryptic recombination signal sequences (crsss) identified near the translocation breakpoint in these examples support v(d)j recombination with efficiencies ranging from about 30- to 20,000-fold less than bona fide v(d)j recombination signals. to understand the molecular basis for these large differences, we investigated the binding and cleavage of these crsss by the rag1/2 proteins that initiate v(d)j recombination. we find that the rag proteins comparably bind all crsss tested, albeit more poorly than a consensus rss. we show that four crsss that support levels of v(d)j recombination above background levels in cell culture (lmo2, tal1, ttg-1, and sil) are also cleaved by the rag proteins in vitro with efficiencies ranging from 18 to 70% of a consensus rss. cleavage of lmo2 and ttg-1 by the rag proteins can also be detected in cell culture using ligation-mediated pcr. in contrast, hox11 and scl are nicked but not cleaved efficiently in vitro, and cleavage at other adventitious sites in plasmid substrates may also limit the ability to detect recombination activity at these crsss in cell culture.
significance traf6 is essential for many biological processes, including the operation of the innate immune system and bone formation. the enzymatic activity of traf6, an e3 ubiquitin ligase, is thought to have a pivotal role in triggering these processes. in this paper, we reexamined this assumption by generating mice expressing a catalytically inactive mutant of traf6. the bone structure of the mice was normal and a major intracellular signaling pathway of the immune system could still be switched on. we found that other e3 ligases, pellino1 and pellino2, could generate the ubiquitin chains needed to switch on immune signaling in human cells expressing catalytically inactive traf6. our findings identify essential roles of traf6 that are independent of its enzymatic activity. it is widely accepted that the essential role of traf6 in vivo is to generate the lys63-linked ubiquitin (k63-ub) chains needed to activate the “master” protein kinase tak1. here, we report that traf6 e3 ligase activity contributes to but is not essential for the il-1–dependent formation of k63-ub chains, tak1 activation, or il-8 production in human cells, because pellino1 and pellino2 generate the k63-ub chains required for signaling in cells expressing e3 ligase-inactive traf6 mutants. the il-1–induced formation of k63-ub chains and ubiquitylation of irak1, irak4, and myd88 was abolished in traf6/pellino1/pellino2 triple-knockout (ko) cells, but not in traf6 ko or pellino1/2 double-ko cells. the reexpression of e3 ligase-inactive traf6 mutants partially restored il-1 signaling in traf6 ko cells, but not in traf6/pellino1/pellino2 triple-ko cells. pellino1-generated k63-ub chains activated the tak1 complex in vitro with similar efficiently to traf6-generated k63-ub chains. the early phase of tlr signaling and the tlr-dependent secretion of il-10 (controlled by iraks 1 and 2) was only reduced modestly in primary macrophages from knockin mice expressing the e3 ligase-inactive traf6[l74h] mutant, but the late-phase production of il-6, il-12, and tnfα (controlled only by the pseudokinase irak2) was abolished. rankl-induced signaling in macrophages and the differentiation of bone marrow to osteoclasts was similar in traf6[l74h] and wild-type cells, explaining why the bone structure and teeth of the traf6[l74h] mice was normal, unlike traf6 ko mice. we identify two essential roles of traf6 that are independent of its e3 ligase activity. tumor necrosis factor (tnf) receptor–associated factor (traf)-6 mediates lys63-linked polyubiquitination for nf-κb activation via its n-terminal ring and zinc finger domains. here we report the crystal structures of traf6 and its complex with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (e2) ubc13. the ring and zinc fingers of traf6 assume a rigid, elongated structure. interaction of traf6 with ubc13 involves direct contacts of the ring and the preceding residues, and the first zinc finger has a structural role. unexpectedly, this region of traf6 is dimeric both in the crystal and in solution, different from the trimeric c-terminal traf domain. structure-based mutagenesis reveals that traf6 dimerization is crucial for polyubiquitin synthesis and autoubiquitination. fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis shows that traf6 dimerization induces higher-order oligomerization of full-length traf6. the mismatch of dimeric and trimeric symmetry may provide a mode of infinite oligomerization that facilitates ligand-dependent signal transduction of many immune receptors.
abstract the strengths of interpersonal dyads formed by the attacker and defender in one-on-one situations are crucial for performance in team ball sports such as soccer. the purpose of this study was to analyze the kinematics of one-on-one defensive movements in soccer competitions, and determine the relationships between lower limb kinematics and the center of mass translation during cutting actions. six defensive scenes in which a player was responding to an offender’s dribble attack were selected for analysis. to reconstruct the three-dimensional kinematics of the players, we used a photogrammetric model-based image-matching technique. the hip and knee kinematics were calculated from the matched skeleton model. in addition, the center of mass height was expressed as a ratio of each participant’s body height. the relationships between the center of mass height and the kinematics were determined by the pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient. the normalized center of mass height at initial contact was correlated with the vertical center of mass displacement (r = 0.832, p = 0.040) and hip flexion angle at initial contact (r = −0.823, p = 0.044). this suggests that the lower center of mass at initial contact is an important factor to reduce the downwards vertical center of mass translation during defensive cutting actions, and that this is executed primarily through hip flexion. it is therefore recommended that players land with an adequately flexed hip at initial contact during one-on-one cutting actions to minimize the vertical center of mass excursion. in many situations, e.g. sports injuries, three-dimensional kinematics cannot be obtained with traditional lab methods. however, if methods for reconstructing motion patterns from video sequences were available, our understanding of injury mechanisms could be improved. the aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of a new model-based image-matching technique for human motion reconstruction from one or more uncalibrated video sequences, using traditional motion analysis as a gold standard. a laboratory trial was conducted with one test subject performing jogging and side step cutting, while being filmed with three ordinary video cameras. this provided three single camera matchings, three double camera matchings and one triple camera matching for each of the motions. the test subject wore 33 reflective skin markers and was filmed with a seven-camera, 240 hz motion analysis system. root mean square (rms) hip and knee flexion/extension angle differences were less than 12 degrees for all the matchings. estimates for ad-/abduction (<15 degrees) and internal/external rotation (<16 degrees) were less precise. rms velocity differences up to 0.62 m/s were found for the single camera matchings, but for the triple camera matching the rms differences were less than 0.13 m/s for each direction. in conclusion, a new model-based image-matching technique has been developed, that can be used to estimate temporal joint angle histories, velocities and accelerations from uncalibrated video recordings. the kinematic estimates, in particular for center of mass velocity and acceleration, are clearly better when two or more camera views are available. this method can potentially be used to arrive at more precise descriptions of the mechanisms of sports injuries than what has been possible without elaborate methods for three-dimensional reconstruction from uncalibrated video sequences, e.g. for knee injuries.
the influence of central injection of a new corticotropin releasing factor (crf) antagonist, astressin, [cyclo(30-33)[d-phe12,nle21,38,glu30,lys33]r/ hcrf12-41)], on exogenous and endogenous crf-induced gastric ileus and stimulation of bowel discharges was investigated in conscious rats. intracisternal (ic) crf (0.6 microg) reduced gastric emptying of a noncaloric solution to 17.1 +/- 4.9% compared with 50.1 +/- 4.6% in control group injected i.c. with vehicle. astressin (1,3 and 10 microg, i.c.) dose dependently prevented ic crf-induced delayed gastric emptying by 33, 100 and 100%, respectively, and had no effect on basal gastric emptying. abdominal surgery with cecal manipulation (1 min) reduced gastric emptying to 19.8 +/- 5.5% 3 hr postsurgery compared with 59.9 +/- 5.2% after anesthesia alone plus i.c. vehicle. astressin (1,3 and 10 microg, i.c.) prevented postoperative gastric ileus by 56, 93 and 92%, respectively. intracerebroventricular crf (0.6 microg) and water-avoidance stress stimulated pellet output (number/60 min) to 5 +/- 1 and 11 +/- 2, respectively, compared with no fecal pellet output after i.c.v. vehicle and no exposure to stress. astressin (3 and 10 microg, i.c.v.) blocked exogenous crf action by 47 and 63%, respectively, and colonic response to stress by 0 and 54%, respectively. these data indicate that astressin injected into the csf at low doses (1-10 microg) has an antagonistic action against crf and stress-related alterations of gastrointestinal motor function, without an intrinsic effect in these in vivo systems. astressin may be a useful tool to explore functional crf-dependent physiological pathways in specific brain nuclei. background/aims interleukin 1 beta (il-1 beta) increases the release of corticotropin-releasing factor (crf) in the brain through prostaglandin pathways. because central crf inhibits gastric motor function, the influence and mechanism of action of intracisternal injection of il-1 beta on gastric emptying were investigated.   methods the 20-minute rate of gastric emptying of a nonnutrient test meal was assessed by the phenol red methylcellulose method 30 minutes after injection of human recombinant il-1 beta in conscious rats.   results il-1 beta injected intracisternally (0.01-1 ng) or intravenously (0.01-10 ng) dose-dependently decreased gastric emptying by 10%-82% and 0%-89%, respectively. the median effective dose (ed50) was 30-fold lower when il-1 beta was injected intracisternally (0.1 ng) than intravenously (3 ng). the inhibitory effect of intracisternal il-1 beta had a rapid onset (within 20 minutes) and was long-lasting (6 hours). indomethacin (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) completely prevented the 61% inhibition induced by intracisternal il-1 beta (0.1 ng) but had no effect on crf-induced (600 ng) 72% inhibition of gastric emptying. the intracisternal injection of the il-1 receptor antagonist (100 ng) or the crf antagonist [dphe12, [dphe12,nle21,38,c alpha meleu37]crf12-41 (20 micrograms) prevented by 100% and 52%, respectively, the inhibition of gastric emptying evoked by intracisternal il-1 beta (0.1 ng). the antagonists alone had no effect on basal gastric emptying.   conclusions il-1 beta acts in the brain to induce a long-lasting inhibition of gastric emptying; il-1 beta action is mediated through central il-1 receptors and prostaglandin- and crf-dependent mechanisms.
background & aims little is known about the optimal management of patients with chronic hepatitis b (chb) who developed multiple-drug resistance.   methods we assessed 91 patients with compensated chb who developed adefovir-resistant mutations during adefovir monotherapy for lamivudine-resistant chb. of these, 41 were treated with a combination of lamivudine plus adefovir (lam+adv group) and 50 were treated with entecavir monotherapy (etv group).   results there were no significant differences between the two groups in baseline characteristics, including serum hbv dna levels (p>0.05). the rate of virologic non-response (hbv dna reduction <1 log(10) iu/ml at 6 months) was significantly greater in the lam+adv than in the etv group (51.2% vs. 16.0%, p<0.01). at 12 months, hbv dna declined less in the lam+adv than in the etv group (-1.49+/-1.78 vs. -3.47+/-2.13 log(10) iu/ml, p<0.01). only 12.2% and 22.0% of patients in the lam+adv and etv groups, respectively, achieved complete virologic response (hbv dna <60 iu/ml) at 12 months. multivariable analysis showed that lam+adv group (or=0.08, ci=0.02-0.28) and the presence of the rta181v/t mutation (or=0.21, ci=0.05-0.91) were independently associated with a decreased rate of virologic response (hbv dna <2000 iu/ml) at 12 months.   conclusions in patients with chb resistant to lamivudine and adefovir, combination therapy with these two drugs was not effective and was inferior to entecavir monotherapy in suppressing hbv dna. however, the response to entecavir monotherapy was also not optimal. these results emphasize the importance of preventing the development of multidrug-resistant hbv and of exploration for adequate combination therapy in treatment of multidrug-resistant chb. multi‐drug resistant hepatitis b virus (hbv) has been reported in hepatitis b patients who received sequential antiviral therapy. in vitro studies showed that hbv constructs with mutations resistant to lamivudine and adefovir have marked reduction in sensitivity to combination of lamivudine and adefovir, whereas constructs with mutations resistant to either drug remain sensitive to the other drug. we conducted this study to determine whether mutations conferring resistance to multiple antiviral agents co‐locate on the same hbv genome in vivo and to describe the evolution of these mutations. sera from six patients who had been found to have multi‐drug resistant hbv mutations to lamivudine + adefovir, lamivudine + hepatitis b immunoglobulin (hbig), or lamivudine + entecavir on direct sequencing were cloned after nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr). analysis of 215 clones from 11 samples with multi‐drug resistant mutations on direct sequencing showed that 183 (85%) clones had mutations to both therapies on the same genome; 31 clones had lamivudine‐resistant mutants only. clonal analysis of serial samples from three patients showed progressive evolution from all clones with lamivudine‐resistant hbv mutations only to mixtures of clones that have multi‐drug resistant mutations and clones that have lamivudine‐resistant hbv mutations only, and ultimately all clones having multi‐drug resistant hbv mutations. in conclusion, mutations conferring resistance to multiple antiviral agents co‐locate on the same viral genome, suggesting that combination therapy directed against mutants resistant to each treatment may not be adequate in suppressing multi‐drug resistant hbv. de novo combination therapy may prevent the emergence of multi‐drug resistant mutants.

background quercetin and trans-resveratrol (trans-rsv) are plant polyphenols reported to reduce inflammation or insulin resistance associated with obesity. recently, we showed that grape powder extract, which contains quercetin and trans-rsv, attenuates markers of inflammation in human adipocytes and macrophages and insulin resistance in human adipocytes. however, we do not know how quercetin and trans-rsv individually affected these outcomes.   objective the aim of this study was to examine the extent to which quercetin and trans-rsv prevented inflammation or insulin resistance in primary cultures of human adipocytes treated with tumor necrosis factor-α (tnf-α)-an inflammatory cytokine elevated in the plasma and adipose tissue of obese, diabetic individuals.   design cultures of human adipocytes were pretreated with quercetin and trans-rsv followed by treatment with tnf-α. subsequently, gene and protein markers of inflammation and insulin resistance were measured.   results quercetin, and to a lesser extent trans-rsv, attenuated the tnf-α-induced expression of inflammatory genes such as interleukin (il)-6, il-1β, il-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1) and the secretion of il-6, il-8, and mcp-1. quercetin attenuated tnf-α-mediated phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase and c-jun-nh₂ terminal kinase, whereas trans-rsv attenuated only c-jun-nh₂ terminal kinase phosphorylation. quercetin and trans-rsv attenuated tnf-α-mediated phosphorylation of c-jun and degradation of inhibitory κb protein. quercetin, but not trans-rsv, decreased tnf-α-induced nuclear factor-κb transcriptional activity. quercetin and trans-rsv attenuated the tnf-α-mediated suppression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (pparγ) and pparγ target genes and of pparγ protein concentrations and transcriptional activity. quercetin prevented the tnf-α-mediated serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 and protein tyrosine phosphatase-1b gene expression and the suppression of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, whereas trans-rsv prevented only the tnf-α-mediated serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1.   conclusion these data suggest that quercetin is equally or more effective than trans-rsv in attenuating tnf-α-mediated inflammation and insulin resistance in primary human adipocytes. the facilitative glucose transporter, glut4, mediates insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes and muscles, and the participation of glut4 in the pathogenesis of various clinical conditions associated with obesity, visceral fat accumulation and insulin resistance has been proposed. glucose uptake by some members of the glut family, mainly glut1, is inhibited by flavonoids, the natural polyphenols present in fruits, vegetables and wine. therefore it is of interest to establish if these polyphenolic compounds present in the diet, known to be effective antioxidants but also endowed with several other biological activities such as protein-tyrosine kinase inhibition, interfere with glut4 function. in the present study, we show that three flavonoids, quercetin, myricetin and catechin-gallate, inhibit the uptake of methylglucose by adipocytes over the concentration range of 10-100 microm. these three flavonoids show a competitive pattern of inhibition, with k(i)=16, 33.5 and 90 microm respectively. in contrast, neither catechin nor gallic acid inhibit methylglucose uptake. to obtain a better understanding of the interaction among glut4 and flavonoids, we have derived a glut4 three-dimensional molecular comparative model, using structural co-ordinates from a glut3 comparative model and a mechanosensitive ion channel [pdb (protein data bank) code 1msl] solved by x-ray diffraction. on the whole, the experimental evidence and computer simulation data favour a transport inhibition mechanism in which flavonoids and glut4 interact directly, rather than by a mechanism related to protein-tyrosine kinase and insulin signalling inhibition. furthermore, the results suggest that glut transporters are involved in flavonoid incorporation into cells.
studies in adult mammals (rats, cats, mice, and humans) have revealed a surprising regularity in the duration of sleep and wake bouts. in particular, wake bout durations exhibit a power-law distribution whereas sleep bout durations exhibit an exponential distribution. moreover, in rodents, sleep bouts exhibit an exponential distribution at all ages examined, whereas wake bout durations exhibit exponential distributions early in ontogeny with a clear power-law emerging only at the older ages. thus, the data examined thus far suggests a similar developmental trajectory for a wide range of mammals which in turn may offer a novel metric to directly compare human and animal sleep–wake data. therefore, we tested the generalizability of these findings by examining the distributions of sleep and wake bouts during the night in a healthy human sample – from premature infants to 70-year-olds. we find that sleep bouts elongate over the first years. at the same time wake bouts shorten but elongate again with increasing age. moreover, sleep bout durations exhibit exponential distributions at all ages tested, except for the youngest (premature infants). wake bouts exhibit a power-law distribution – but only during a restricted time window during adulthood. we conclude that the developmental trajectory of human sleep–wake cycles does not map well onto those of rodents; however, the method of characterizing sleep–wake cycles, using bout distribution, holds great promise for classifying sleep, its disorders, and tracking its developmental milestones across the lifespan in humans. the ontogenesis of sleep was studied in prematures from 32 to 41 weeks of gestational age the characteristics of the eeg, the patterns and rate of respiration, the cardiac rate, body motility comprised of localized and diffuse movements, localized and diffuse jerks, clonic movements and electromyo-graphic activity of the chin, as well as periods of total quietness were observed and correlated with the progressive organization of behavior in these infants. the data obtained at each gestational age, i.e., at 32–34 weeks, 35–37 weeks, and 38–41 weeks, were compared to those obtained in full-term newborns. the relationships between the different events and the features of the eeg and of the respiratory patterns were ascertained and compared to similar data obtained in the full-term newborn. this comparison shows that the premature at 40 weeks of gestational age has not attained a level of organization as high as that of the full-term newborn. an hypothesis suggesting a possible mechanism of this discrepancy is presented.
abstract we determined whether the increment in cardiac end-diastolic compliance (a reduced diastolic stiffness constant) following endurance training is related to alterations in myocardial collagen characteristics. sixteen weeks of habitual exercise (ex) in rats, which produced left ventricular (lv) hypertrophy (lvh) [lv weight in g: ex=1.01 (0.04), sedentary control = 0.89 (0.04); p<0.05], resulted in a reduced lv end-diastolic (lved) chamber stiffness [slope of the linearised lved pressure versus lved internal diameter relation in kpa · mm−1: ex=0.67 (0.03), control=0.80 (0.03); p<0.05]. the increased lved chamber distensibility was associated with an attenuated myocardial stiffness [slope of the linearised lved stress versus strain relation in g · cm−2; ex=15 (3), control=25 (2); p<0.05]. although lv total collagen content (mg) was increased in the exercised rats [ex=5.0 (0.3), control=4.1 (0.2); p<0.05], this was a reflection of the presence of lvh, as the myocardial collagen concentration (μg · mg−1 lv wet weight) was unaltered [ex=4.9 (0.2), control=4.6 (0.2)]. furthermore, habitual exercise did not influence the percentage of myocardial collagen extracted following cyanogen bromide digestion (an index of collagen cross-linking), [i.e. ex=38 (3), control=38 (3)], nor the proportion of myocardial collagen phenotypes i and iii [i/iii; ex=3.04 (0.20), control=2.85 (0.22)]. in conclusion, exercise-induced increments in end-diastolic myocardial distensibility are unlikely to be a consequence of alterations in the properties of myocardial collagen. left ventricular (lv) chamber and myocardial wall compliance were investigated in rats with exercise-induced cardiac hypertrophy. voluntary exercise training was performed on running wheels. after 16 wk of exercise training, cardiac performance was measured in anesthetized open-chest ventilated rats. lv end-diastolic performance was calculated from both short-axis external diameter and long-axis segmental length measurements. exercise-trained rats developed significant lv hypertrophy (1.03 +/- 0.02 g) compared with control rats (0.91 +/- 0.03 g; p < 0.01). the physiological hypertrophy was associated with an increased lv wall thickness-to-internal radius ratio consistent with a concentric geometry. lv end-diastolic stiffness (slope of the linearized lv end-diastolic pressure-strain relationship) was decreased in both the short (p < 0.02) and long (p < 0.02) axis of lv as a result of exercise training. the lv end-diastolic chamber stiffness (slope of the linearized lv end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship) was also decreased in the exercised group (p < 0.05). the decreased chamber stiffness occurred as a consequence of a decrease in the regional myocardial wall elastic stiffness (slope of the linearized lv end-diastolic stress-strain relationship; p < 0.05). thus an increased lv wall thickness as a result of exercise-induced lv hypertrophy is associated with an enhanced ventricular chamber compliance, which in turn is attributed to a decrease in the diastolic stiffness of the myocardial wall.
&na; the yolk sac and small intestine are 2 important organs responsible for the digestion and absorption of nutrients in chickens during the embryonic and posthatch periods, respectively. the peptide transporter pept1 is expressed in both the yolk sac and small intestine and plays an important role in the transport of amino acids as short peptides. the objective of this study was to profile the spatial transcriptional patterns of pept1 mrna in the yolk sac and small intestine from embryonic and posthatch broilers. the distribution of pept1 mrna was investigated by in situ hybridization at embryonic (e) d 11, 13, 15, 17, 19 and day of hatch (doh) in the yolk sac and at e19, doh, and d 1, d 4, and d 7 posthatch in the small intestine. pept1 mrna was expressed in the endodermal cells of the yolk sac. pept1 mrna was barely detectable at e11, increased from e11 to e13, e15, and e17, and then gradually decreased from e19 to doh. in the small intestine, there was a rapid increase in expression of pept1 mrna in the enterocytes from e19 to doh, with expression relatively constant from d 1 to d 7. in addition, there was a differential increase in the heights of the villi in different parts of the small intestine from d 1 to 7, which may partially explain the temporal increase in pept1 mrna detected by qpcr. the villi in the duodenum showed the earliest increase in villus height and ultimately resulted in the highest villi at d 7. these results demonstrate that there are temporal changes in pept1 mrna expression in the yolk sac and the small intestine, which correspond with their expected role in nutrient uptake during the embryonic and posthatch periods. chick embryos derive nutrients from the yolk during incubation and transition to intestinal absorption of nutrients posthatch. the uptake of nutrients is mediated by a variety of membrane-bound transporter proteins. the objective of this study was to determine the expression profiles of nutrient transporters and digestive enzymes during incubation in the yolk sac membrane (ysm) and embryonic intestine of egg-laying (leghorn) and meat-producing (cobb) chickens derived from 22 to 30 wk (young) and 45 to 50 wk (old) breeder flocks. transporters examined included the peptide transporter pept1, the glutamate/aspartate (eaat3), cationic (cat-1) and neutral (b0at) amino acid transporters, and the fructose (glut5) and glucose (sglt1) transporters. digestive enzymes included aminopeptidase n (apn) and sucrase-isomaltase (si). expression of these genes was assessed by real-time pcr using the absolute quantification method in ysm at embryonic day (e) 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, and 21 and intestine at e15, 17, 19, 20, and 21. the pept1 and apn gene expression in the ysm increased until e15 and then decreased until e21, whereas expression in the intestine increased from e15 to e21. the b0at showed a similar pattern, with greatest expression in the ysm occurring at e17/e19. the cat1 and glut5 genes showed decreased expression in the ysm and increased expression in the intestine until e17/e19 and then a decrease until e21. expression of sglt1 and eaat3 showed increased gene expression over time in both the intestine and ysm. expression of si showed little to no gene expression in the ysm, whereas the intestine exhibited consistently high levels of gene expression. in ysm and intestine, si expression was greater in leghorn than cobb, whereas cat1 and glut5 expression was greater in cobb than leghorn. expression of the apn, cat1, and si genes was greater in embryos from young flocks than old flocks in ysm and intestine. these results demonstrate that the ysm expresses many of the digestive enzymes and nutrient transporters typically associated with the intestine and that these genes show tissue- and development-specific patterns of expression.
this study investigated performance on the delis–kaplan executive function system (d-kefs) tower test in a sample of 12 patients with focal lesions in the lateral prefrontal cortex (pfc) and 12 control participants. pfc patients performed worse overall, spent more time on each move, and committed significantly more rule violations. the rule violation measure demonstrated 83% sensitivity and 100% specificity in the detection of lesions. findings highlight the importance of error monitoring in the assessment of executive functioning. these preliminary results suggest that the lateral pfc may be critical for self-monitoring/inhibition and speed of processing in planning tasks. problem-solving ability was investigated in 25 dsm-iiir schizophrenic (sc) patients using the tower of hanoi (toh) task. their performance was compared to that of: (1) 22 patients with neurosurgical unilateral prefrontal lesions, 11 left (lf) and 10 right hemisphere (rf); (2) 38 patients with unilateral temporal lobectomies, 19 left (lt) and 19 right (rt); and (3) 44 matched control subjects. like the rt and lf group, the schizophrenics were significantly impaired on the toh. the deficit shown by the schizophrenic group was equivalent whether or not the problems to be solved included goal-subgoal conflicts, unlike the lf group who were impaired specifically on these problems. the nature of the sc deficit was also distinct from that of the rt group, in that the problem-solving deficit remained after controlling for the effects of spatial memory performance. this study indicates, therefore, that neither focal frontal nor temporal lobe damage sustained in adult life is a sufficient explanation for the problem-solving deficits found in patients with schizophrenia.
background agrobacterium tumefaciens strain gv3101 (pmp90) is widely used in transient gene expression assays, including assays to study pathogen effectors and plant disease resistance mechanisms. however, inoculation of a. tumefaciens gv3101 into nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) leaves prior to infiltration with pathogenic and non-host strains of pseudomonas syringae results in suppression of macroscopic symptoms when compared with leaves pre-treated with a buffer control. methodology/findings to gain further insight into the mechanistic basis of symptom suppression by a. tumefaciens we examined the effect of pre-treatment with a. tumefaciens on the growth of p. syringae, the production of the plant signalling molecules salicylic acid (sa) and abscisic acid (aba), and the presence of callose deposits. pre-treatment with a. tumefaciens reduced aba levels, p. syringae multiplication and p. syringae-elicited sa and aba production, but promoted increased callose deposition. however, pre-treatment with a. tumefaciens did not suppress necrosis or sa production in leaves inoculated with the elicitor hrpz. conclusions/significance collectively, these results show that inoculation of n. tabacum leaves with a. tumefaciens alters plant hormone levels and plant defence responses to p. syringae, and demonstrate that researchers should consider the impact of a. tumefaciens on plant signal transduction when using a. tumefaciens-mediated transient expression assays to investigate aba-regulated processes or pathogenicity and plant defence mechanisms. plant hormones play important roles in regulating developmental processes and signalling networks involved in plant responses to a wide range of biotic and abiotic stresses. salicylic acid (sa), jasmonates (ja) and ethylene (et) are well known to play crucial roles in plant disease and pest resistance. however, the roles of other hormones such as abscisic acid (aba), auxin, gibberellin (ga), cytokinin (ck) and brassinosteroid (bl) in plant defence are less well known. much progress has been made in understanding plant hormone signalling and plant disease resistance. however, these studies have mostly proceeded independently of each other, and there is limited knowledge regarding interactions between plant hormone-mediated signalling and responses to various pathogens. here, we review the roles of hormones other than sa, ja and et in plant defence and the interactions between hormone-mediated signalling, plant defence and pathogen virulence. we propose that these hormones may influence disease outcomes through their effect on sa or ja signalling.
bindin, a protein involved in sea urchin sperm-egg recognition and adhesion, is under positive selection in genera with sympatric species but evolves neutrally in genera in which all species are allopatric. this pattern has led to suggestions that reinforcement may be the source of the observed selection. reproductive character displacement, or increased divergence of reproductive characters in areas where closely related species overlap, is often a consequence of reinforcement and has been shown to be present in one indo-pacific species of the genus echinometra. in the atlantic species of the same genus, positive selection has been shown to act on bindin of echinometra lucunter. to examine whether the source of this selection is reinforcement, we determined variation on the first exon of bindin in e. lucunter in the caribbean, where it is sympatric with echinometra viridis, and in the rest of the atlantic, where e. viridis is absent. there was no differentiation between bindin sequences from the two geographic regions; similar levels of positive selection were found to be acting in both areas. the similarities were not due to gene flow; mitochondrial dna from the two regions indicates that e. lucunter populations most likely originated in the atlantic and have not exchanged genes with caribbean populations for approximately 200,000 years. the lack of evidence of stronger selection on bindin of e. lucunter in areas of sympatry with its sister species suggests that the source of selection is not reinforcement. processes acting within species, such as sexual selection, sperm competition, or sexual conflict, are more likely to be involved in the evolution of this molecule. bindin is a gamete recognition protein known to control species-specific sperm-egg adhesion and membrane fusion in sea urchins. previous analyses have shown that diversifying selection on bindin amino acid sequence is found when gametically incompatible species are compared, but not when species are compatible. the present study analyzes bindin polymorphism and divergence in the three closely related species of echinometra in central america: e. lucunter and e. viridis from the caribbean, and e. vanbrunti from the eastern pacific. the eggs of e. lucunter have evolved a strong block to fertilization by sperm of its neotropical congeners, whereas those of the other two species have not. as in the indo-west pacific (iwp) echinometra, the neotropical species show high intraspecific bindin polymorphism in the same gene regions as in the iwp species. maximum likelihood analysis shows that many of the polymorphic codon sites are under mild positive selection. of the fixed amino acid replacements, most have accumulated along the bindin lineage of e. lucunter. we analyzed the data with maximum likelihood models of variation in positive selection across lineages and codon sites, and with models that consider sites and lineages simultaneously. our results show that positive selection is concentrated along the e. lucunter bindin lineage, and that codon sites with amino acid replacements fixed in this species show by far the highest signal of positive selection. lineage-specific positive selection paralleling egg incompatibility provides support that adaptive evolution of sperm proteins acts to maintain recognition of bindin by changing egg receptors. because both egg incompatibility and bindin divergence are greater between allopatric species than between sympatric species, the hypothesis of selection against hybridization (reinforcement) cannot explain why adaptive evolution has been confined to a single lineage in the american echinometra. instead, processes acting to varying degrees within species (e.g., sperm competition, sexual selection, and sexual conflict) are more promising explanations for lineage-specific positive selection on bindin.
introduction low-level laser therapy (lllt) has many biostimulative effects such as acceleration of mesiodistal orthodontic tooth movement. however, its effects on the extent and short-term stability of rotational tooth movement have not been researched. the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of low-level laser irradiation during rotational tooth movement on the rate of movement and the amount of relapse in dogs.   methods in this interventional study, fixed orthodontic appliances were used to rotate both mandibular lateral incisors in 8 dogs. sixteen teeth were divided into 2 groups: the experimental group with lllt during orthodontic force application, and a control group with orthodontic couple force application only. in the first group, the gallium-aluminum-arsenide diode laser (810 nm, 200 mw, 10 seconds, 2 j/session, 32 j/cm(2)/point) was emitted on 2 points at the buccal side of the roots on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28 during 4 weeks of movement, and the amount of relapse was then observed for 3 months. the extent of rotational movement was measured on dental casts, and the statistical analysis was carried out with t tests.   results there was no significant difference between the lllt group and the control group on the amount of rotational tooth movement (p = 0.66). the mean percentages of relapse after 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months were 33.02%, 53.44%, and 60.64% in the lllt group and 54.22%, 68.74%, and 73.92% in the control group, respectively. this demonstrates significant differences between these groups at all studied times (p ≤0.05). this difference was greatest in the first week and then decreased until the end of the third month. the greatest percentage of relapse in both groups was registered in the first week after tooth movement.   conclusions the total energy dose of the laser used in this study could not accelerate rotational tooth movement, but it did effectively reduce the relapse tendency in teeth rotated by orthodontic movements. it has previously been reported that low-energy laser irradiation stimulated the velocity of tooth movement via the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa b (rank)/rank ligand and the macrophage colony-stimulating factor/its receptor (c-fms) systems. matrix metalloproteinase (mmp)-9, cathepsin k, and alpha(v) beta(3) [alpha(v)beta3] integrin are essential for osteoclastogenesis; therefore, the present study was designed to examine the effects of low-energy laser irradiation on the expression of mmp-9, cathepsin k, and alpha(v)beta3 integrin during experimental tooth movement. fifty male, 6-week-old wistar strain rats were used in the experiment. a total force of 10g was applied to the rat molars to induce tooth movement. a ga-al-as diode laser was used to irradiate the area around the moving tooth and, after 7 days, the amount of tooth movement was measured. to determine the amount of tooth movement, plaster models of the maxillae were made using a silicone impression material before (day 0) and after tooth movement (days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7). the models were scanned using a contact-type three-dimensional (3-d) measurement apparatus. immunohistochemical staining for mmp-9, cathepsin k, and integrin subunits of alpha(v)beta3 was performed. intergroup comparisons of the average values were conducted with a mann-whitney u-test for tooth movement and the number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (trap), mmp-9, cathepsin k, and integrin subunits of alpha(v)beta3-positive cells. in the laser-irradiated group, the amount of tooth movement was significantly greater than that in the non-irradiated group at the end of the experiment (p < 0.05). cells positively stained with trap, mmp-9, cathepsin k, and integrin subunits of alpha(v)beta3 were found to be significantly increased in the irradiated group on days 2-7 compared with those in the non-irradiated group (p < 0.05). these findings suggest that low-energy laser irradiation facilitates the velocity of tooth movement and mmp-9, cathepsin k, and integrin subunits of alpha(v)beta3 expression in rats.
background: the impact of very low levels of air pollutants, particulate matter (pm10) and sulfur dioxide (so2) concentrations, on human health is not well characterized. we examined the outcomes (30-day in-hospital mortality) of emergency hospitalizations of respiratory patients and the level of local pollutants on the day of admission. methods: all emergency admissions (82,421 episodes in 44,660 patients) were recorded over 13 years (2002–2014) and mortality assessed. the median interquartile ranges (iqr) age was 64.5 (43.9, 78.5) years with the proportion of males at 48.5%. univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to examine relationships between pollutant concentration (pm10 and so2) and odds ratio (or) for 30-day in hospital death, after adjustment for acuity. results: mortality related to each pollutant variable assessed (as quintiles of increasing atmospheric concentration). for pm10 mortality, the highest two quintiles concentrations were significantly increased (p < 0.001) with univariate ors of 1.30. for so2, the ors were 1.32, 1.39, and 1.46, for the top three quintiles. there was also a strong relationship between the underlying respiratory function; with forced expiratory volume (fev1) in 1 second (fev1) ≥ 2.0l at the lowest pm10 quintile, mortality was 6.5% (95% ci: 6.1, 6.9) increasing to 9.5% (95% ci: 9.0, 10.0) at the highest pm10 quintile. for patients with fev1 < 2.0l, the mortality at the lowest pm10 quintile was 9.9% (95% ci: 8.8, 10.9) increasing to 14.2% (95% ci: 12.8, 15.6) at the highest quintile. conclusion: despite air quality improvement, there was a clear relationship between pollutant concentration and outcomes for respiratory emergency admissions; additionally, the underlying level of pulmonary function was predictive of in-hospital mortality. in the 1930s, 40s, and 50s, several episodes of extreme air pollution focused attention on the potential for adverse health effects of air pollution. these included an episode in the meuse valley, belgium, in december 1930 ( 15), an episode in donora, pennsylvania in 1948 (36), and several episodes in london, england (23, 44). the sudden large increases in sickness and death that accompanied such episodes demonstrated that air pollution can adversely affect human health. the increased mortality associated with such episodes provided the first quantitative measure of the adverse effects of air pollution. by the 1970s, a link had been well established between respiratory disease and particulate and/or sulfur-oxide air pollution, but still there remained disagreement as to the level of pollution that would significantly affect human health. in reviewing research published between 1968 and 1977, holland and several other prominent british scientists ( 19) concluded that particulate and related air pollution at high levels pose hazards to human health, but that health effects of particulate pollution at lower concentrations could not be "disentangled" from health effects of other factors. shy (45) responded by asserting that the review by holland et al systematically discounted evidence of pollution-related health effects at contemporary pollution levels. shy, and other reviewers ( 1, 12, 45, 54), contended that the cumulative weight of evidence provided sound reasons to believe that
using a new-keynesian model with endogenous capital accumulation, i show that uncertainty about fiscal policy can cause large declines in consumption, investment, and output when the zero lower bound (zlb) binds, but has modest effects when the monetary authority is not constrained by the zlb. i study uncertainty about the level of government spending and uncertainty about tax rates on consumption, wages, capital income, and investment. in my model, uncertainty about government spending and the wage tax rate has particularly large effects. i show that the effects of fiscal policy uncertainty are largest when the nominal interest rate is on the cusp of the zlb and also that delaying fiscal policy uncertainty diminishes its effects only if the resolution of uncertainty occurs after zlb no longer binds. many commentators argue that uncertainty about taxes, government spending and other policy matters deepened the recession of 2007-2009 and slowed the recovery. to investigate this issue we develop a new index of policy-related economic uncertainty and estimate its dynamic relationship to output, investment and employment. our index averages several components that reflect the frequency of news media references to economic policy uncertainty, the number of federal tax code provisions set to expire in future years, and the extent of forecaster disagreement over future inflation and federal government purchases. the index spikes near consequential presidential elections and after major events such as the gulf wars and the 9/11 attack. index values are very high in recent years with clear jumps around the lehman bankruptcy and tarp legislation, the 2010 midterm elections, the eurozone crisis and the u.s. debt-ceiling dispute. we also construct an index of european economic policy uncertainty mirroring our american news-based index. var estimates show that an increase in policy uncertainty equal to the actual change between 2006 and 2011 foreshadows large and persistent declines in aggregate outcomes, with peak declines of 3.2% in real gdp, 16% in private investment and 2.3 million in aggregate employment. jel no. d80, e22, e66, g18, l50
in our previous work we showed that ngal, a protein involved in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation, is overexpressed in human breast cancer (bc) and predicts poor prognosis. in neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nact) pathological complete response (pcr) is a predictor for outcome. the aim of this study was to evaluate ngal as a predictor of response to nact and to validate ngal as a prognostic factor for clinical outcome in patients with primary bc. immunohistochemistry was performed on tissue microarrays from 652 core biopsies from bc patients, who underwent nact in the gepartrio trial. ngal expression and intensity was evaluated separately. ngal was detected in 42.2% of the breast carcinomas in the cytoplasm. ngal expression correlated with negative hormone receptor (hr) status, but not with other baseline parameters. ngal expression did not correlate with pcr in the full population, however, ngal expression and staining intensity were significantly associated with higher pcr rates in patients with positive hr status. in addition, strong ngal expression correlated with higher pcr rates in node negative patients, patients with histological grade 1 or 2 tumors and a tumor size <40 mm. in univariate survival analysis, positive ngal expression and strong staining intensity correlated with decreased disease-free survival (dfs) in the entire cohort and different subgroups, including hr positive patients. similar correlations were found for intense staining and decreased overall survival (os). in multivariate analysis, ngal expression remained an independent prognostic factor for dfs. the results show that in low-risk subgroups, ngal was found to be a predictive marker for pcr after nact. furthermore, ngal could be validated as an independent prognostic factor for decreased dfs in primary human bc. neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (ngal) is a small, secreted glycoprotein with proposed functions in cell proliferation, survival and morphogenesis. ngal is expressed in a variety of tumor types including breast carcinomas, but it is not known whether ngal contributes directly to breast cancer progression. this study examines the relationship between ngal expression in breast carcinomas and established clinical prognostic markers as well as clinical outcome. using immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays containing well characterized tumor samples from 207 breast cancer patients, ngal was detected in 68 breast carcinomas in a cytoplasmic location. ngal expression correlated strongly with negative steroid receptor status, her-2/neu overexpression, poor histologic grade, the presence of lymph node metastases and a high ki-67 proliferation index. in univariate survival analysis, ngal expression was associated with decreased disease-specific survival and decreased disease-free survival in the entire cohort. in multivariate analysis, ngal remained an independent prognostic marker for disease-free survival. in a subset of patients with estrogen receptor positive tumors, ngal was significantly associated with decreased disease-free survival. the results show that ngal expression is a predictor of poor prognosis in primary human breast cancer and suggest that ngal detection may provide information for risk assessment and identify a subset of patients requiring more aggressive adjuvant therapy.
a smile may convey different communicative intentions depending on subtle characteristics of the facial expression. moreover, during an interaction, the expression of smile impacts on the observer's perception of both the social stance of the speaker and of the content of the talk. in this paper, we describe a perceptual study where we explore the effects of virtual characters displaying different types of smiles (namely politeness and amusement) when speaking on the user's perception. based on the collected data, a model to automatically compute the user's potential perception of the virtual character's social stance depending on its smiling behavior and on its gender has been proposed. social psychological research demonstrates that the same behavior might lead to different evaluations depending on whether it is shown by a man or a woman. with a view to design decisions with regard to virtual humans it is relevant to test whether this pattern also applies to gendered virtual humans. in a 2×2 between subjects experiment we manipulated the rapport agent's gaze behavior and its gender in order to test whether especially female agents are evaluated more negatively when they do not show gender specific immediacy behavior and avoid gazing at the interaction partner. instead of this interaction effect we found two main effects: gaze avoidance was evaluated negatively and female agents were rated more positively than male agents.
the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of serum-starvation, contact-inhibition and roscovitine treatments on cell-cycle synchronization at the g0/g1 stage of ear skin fibroblasts isolated from transgenic cloned cattle. the developmental competence of re-cloned embryos was also examined. our results showed that the proportion of g0/g1 cells from the serum-starved group at 3, 4 or 5 days was significantly higher compared with 1 or 2 days only (91.5, 91.7 and 93.5% versus 90.1 and 88.8%, respectively, p < 0.05); whilst there was no statistical difference among cells at 3, 4 or 5 days. for roscovitine-treated cells, the proportion of g0/g1 cells at 2, 3, 4 or 5 days was significantly higher than those treated for 1 day only (91.1, 90.1, 89.4 and 91.3% versus 86.51%, respectively, p < 0.05). the proportion of contact-inhibited g0/g1 cells rose significantly with treatment time, but was similar at 3, 4 and 5 days (89.4, 90.4, 91.4, 91.6 and 92.1%, respectively, p < 0.05). the efficiency of obtaining g0/g1 phase cells was lower when roscovitine treatment was employed to synchronize the cell cycle compared with the serum-starvation and contact-inhibition methods (89.7 versus 91.1% and 91.0%, p < 0.05). moreover, obvious differences were observed in the rate of fused couplets and blastocysts (89.88 +/- 2.70 versus 87.40 +/- 5.13; 44.10 +/- 8.62 versus 58.38 +/- 13.28, respectively, p < 0.05), when nuclear transfer embryos were reconstructed using donors cells that had been serum starved or contact inhibited for 3 days. our data indicate that 3 day treatment is feasible for harvesting sufficient g0/g1 cells to produce re-cloned transgenic bovine embryos, regardless of whether serum-starvation, contact-inhibition or roscovitine treatments are used as the synchronization methods. synchronization of the cell cycle stages in g0/g1 phase is one of the key factors determining the success of nuclear transplantation. serum deprivation, contact inhibition and chemical inhibitors are widely used methods for this purpose. in this study, cell cycle stages of foetal fibroblasts and cumulus cells were determined using flow cytometry [fluorescence-activated cell scan (facs)]. foetal fibroblasts (in vitro cultured for 72-120 h) and fresh cumulus cells were analysed in experiment 1. fifty to 55% proliferating fibroblasts remained in g0/g1 phase compared with 78% in confluent culture (p <0.05). in contrast to foetal fibroblasts, fresh cumulus cells maintained 90% of the population in the g0/g1 stage. when serum was retrieved from the proliferating fibroblasts from day 1 to day 5 (experiment 2), proportions of g0/g1 cells increased from the initial ratio of 53 to 87% at day 4 of starvation, which was significantly higher than the non-starved proliferating cells (p <0.05). in experiment 3, fibroblasts were treated with aphidicolin (0.1 microg/ml, 6 h), demicolcine (0.5 microg/ml, 10 h), or a combination of these two chemicals to synchronize the cell cycle stages. surprisingly, no differences or significantly lower in the proportions of g0/g1)phase cells were detected (25-50%) compared with the uncontrolled growing cells (53%). these results suggested that fresh cumulus cells rest their cell cycle in g0/g1 stage. serum deprivation became effective in the first 24 h and reached the highest proportions during days 4-5 after deprivation. chemical synchronization of the cell cycle stage of rabbit foetal fibroblasts to g0/g1 phase appeared less effective compared to serum deprivation.
inductive reasoning is an everyday process that allows us to make sense of the world by creating rules from a series of instances. consistent with accounts of process-based fractionations of the prefrontal cortex (pfc) along the left–right axis, inductive reasoning has been reliably localized to left pfc. however, these results may be confounded by the task domain, which is typically verbal. indeed, some studies show that right pfc activation is seen with spatial tasks. this study used fmri to examine the effects of process and domain on the brain regions recruited during a novel pattern discovery task. twenty healthy young adult participants were asked to discover the rule underlying the presentation of a series of letters in varied spatial locations. the rules were either verbal (pertaining to a single semantic category) or spatial (geometric figures). bilateral ventrolateral pfc activations were seen for the spatial domain, while the verbal domain showed only left ventrolateral pfc. a conjunction analysis revealed that the two domains recruited a common region of left ventrolateral pfc. the data support a central role of left pfc in inductive reasoning. importantly, they also suggest that both process and domain shape the localization of reasoning in the brain. despite the recent interest in the neuroanatomy of inductive reasoning processes, the regional specificity within prefrontal cortex (pfc) for the different mechanisms involved in induction tasks remains to be determined. in this study, we used fmri to investigate the contribution of pfc regions to rule acquisition (rule search and rule discovery) and rule following. twenty-six healthy young adult participants were presented with a series of images of cards, each consisting of a set of circles numbered in sequence with one colored blue. participants had to predict the position of the blue circle on the next card. the rules that had to be acquired pertained to the relationship among succeeding stimuli. responses given by subjects were categorized in a series of phases either tapping rule acquisition (responses given up to and including rule discovery) or rule following (correct responses after rule acquisition). mid-dorsolateral pfc (mid-dlpfc) was active during rule search and remained active until successful rule acquisition. by contrast, rule following was associated with activation in temporal, motor, and medial/anterior prefrontal cortex. moreover, frontopolar cortex (fpc) was active throughout the rule acquisition and rule following phases before a rule became familiar. we attributed activation in mid-dlpfc to hypothesis generation and in fpc to integration of multiple separate inferences. the present study provides evidence that brain activation during inductive reasoning involves a complex network of frontal processes and that different subregions respond during rule acquisition and rule following phases.
tese de doutoramento em psicologia, na especialidade de neuropsicologia, apresentada a faculdade de psicologia e de ciencias da educacao da universidade de coimbra the free and cued selective reminding test (fcsrt) is a verbal episodic memory test used to identify patients with mild alzheimer's disease (ad). the present study investigates the relationships between performance on fcsrt and grey matter atrophy assessed with structural mri in patients with ad. three complementary mri-based analyses (vbm analysis, roi-based analysis, and three-dimensional hippocampal surface-based shape analysis) were performed in 35 patients with ad to analyze correlations between regional atrophy and their scores for episodic memory using the fcsrt. with vbm analysis, the total score on the fcsrt was correlated with left medial temporal lobe atrophy including the left hippocampus but also the thalami. in addition, using roi-based analysis, the total recall score on the fcsrt was correlated with the left hippocampal volume. with three-dimensional hippocampal surface-based shape analysis, both free recall and total recall scores were correlated with regions corresponding approximately to the ca1 field. no correlation was found with short term memory scores using any of these methods of analysis. in ad, the fcsrt may be considered as a useful clinical marker of memory disorders due to medial temporal damage, specially the ca1 field of the hippocampus.
objective altered cortisol response is a vulnerability marker for a variety of stress-related diseases and psychiatric disorders. childhood adversity has been shown to modify this response, but evidence is inconsistent. effects may differ depending on the timing of exposure, or due to the interplay between pre/postnatal adversity and later adversities. the present study examined the influence of adversity during different timeframes (pre/postnatal, ages 0-5, 6-11, 12-13, 14-15 years), and the interaction between pre/postnatal and later adversity on adolescents' cortisol stress response.   method four salivary cortisol samples were collected before and after a social stress test in 471 16-year-old adolescents from the longitudinal study trails. data on pre/postnatal exposure to adversities were obtained from preventive child healthcare records and parental reports, subsequent adversities from parental and self-reports.   results pre/postnatal adversity was associated with increased cortisol reactivity. adversities during ages 0-5 were not associated with cortisol outcomes. adversities during ages 6-11 were associated with a high cortisol level, especially in those exposed to pre/postnatal adversity, while adversities during ages 12-13 and 14-15 were associated with a low cortisol level.   conclusions results highlight the importance to take the timing of stress exposure into account. in addition to programming effects, pre/postnatal adversity interacts with childhood adversity in producing deviant cortisol levels. puberty may be marked by a transition in how adversities affect the hpa-axis, with cortisol hypersecretion before age 11 and hyposecretion after age 11. background animal models have linked early maternal separation with lifelong changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (hpa) axis activity. although this is paralleled in human studies, this is often in the context of other life adversities, for example, divorce or adoption, and it is not known whether early separation in the absence of these factors has long term effects on the hpa axis.   aims the finnish experience in world war ii created a natural experiment to test whether separation from a father serving in the armed forces or from both parents due to war evacuation are associated with alterations in hpa axis response to psychosocial stress in late adulthood.   method 282 subjects (m=63.5 years, sd=2.5), of whom 85 were non-separated, 129 were separated from their father, and 68 were separated from both their caregivers during wwii, were enlisted to participate in a trier social stress test (tsst), during which we measured salivary cortisol and, for 215 individuals, plasma cortisol and acth concentrations. we used mixed models to study whether parental separation is associated with salivary and plasma cortisol or plasma acth reactivity, and linear regressions to analyse differences in the baseline, or incremental area under the cortisol or acth curves.   results participants separated from their father did not differ significantly from non-separated participants. however, those separated from both parents had higher average salivary cortisol and plasma acth concentrations across all time points compared to the non-separated group. they also had higher salivary cortisol reactivity to the tsst. separated women had higher baselines in plasma cortisol and acth, whereas men had higher reactivity in response to stress during the tsst. participants who had experienced the separation in early childhood were more affected than children separated during infancy or school age.   conclusions separation from parents during childhood may alter an individual's stress physiology much later in adult life.
although evolutionary change within most species is thought to occur slowly, recent studies have identified cases where evolutionary change has apparently occurred over a few generations. anthropogenically altered environments appear particularly open to rapid evolutionary change over comparatively short time scales. here, we consider a pacific salmon population that may have experienced life‐history evolution, in response to habitat alteration, within a few generations. historically, juvenile fall chinook salmon (oncorhynchus tshawytscha) from the snake river migrated as subyearlings to the ocean. with changed riverine conditions that resulted from hydropower dam construction, some juveniles now migrate as yearlings, but more interestingly, the yearling migration tactic has made a large contribution to adult returns over the last decade. optimal life‐history models suggest that yearling juvenile migrants currently have a higher fitness than subyearling migrants. although phenotypic plasticity likely accounts for some of the change in migration tactics, we suggest that evolution also plays a significant role. evolutionary change prompted by anthropogenic alterations to the environment has general implications for the recovery of endangered species. the case study we present herein illustrates the importance of integrating evolutionary considerations into conservation planning for species at risk. salmonine fishes are commonly subjected to strong, novel selective pressures due to anthropogenic activities and global climate change, often resulting in population extinction. consequently, there is considerable interest in predicting the long‐term evolutionary trajectories of extant populations. knowledge of the genetic architecture of fitness traits is integral to making these predictions. we reviewed the published, peer‐reviewed literature for estimates of heritability and genetic correlation for fitness traits in salmonine fishes with two broad goals in mind: summarization of published data and testing for differences among categorical variables (e.g., species, life history type, experimental conditions). balanced coverage of variables was lacking and estimates for wild populations and behavioral traits were nearly absent. distributions of heritability estimates were skewed toward low values and distributions of genetic correlations toward large, positive values, suggesting that significant potential for evolution of traits exists. furthermore, experimental conditions had a direct effect on h2 estimates, and other variables had more complex effects on h2 and rg estimates, suggesting that available estimates may be insufficient for use in models to predict evolutionary change in wild populations. given this and other inherent complicating factors, making accurate predictions of the evolutionary trajectories of salmonine fishes will be a difficult task.
of the eight catalytic transglutaminases (tgs), transglutaminase 2 (tg2) has been the most comprehensively studied due to its ubiquitous expression in multiple cell types. despite the observed critical role for this enzyme in multiple biological processes in vitro, tg2 knockout mouse models have shown no severe developmental phenotypes, suggesting compensation by other tgs. to begin characterization of the compensating mechanisms, we analyzed total transamidating activity and expression patterns of all catalytically active tgs in seven different tissues/organs from wild-type and tg2 knockout mice. inhibitory analysis with tg2-specific inhibitor kcc-009 suggests that relative contribution of tg2 in total transamidating activity differs in various tissues. accordingly, our data indicate tissue-specific mechanisms of compensation for the loss of tg2, including transcriptional compensation in heart and liver versus functional compensation in aorta, kidney and skeletal/cartiagenous tissues. on the contrary, no compensation has been detected in skeletal muscle, suggesting a limited role for the tg2-mediated transamidation in normal development of this tissue. we previously used subtractive hybridization to isolate cdnas for genes upregulated in chick hypertrophic chondrocytes (nurminskaya, m., and t.f. linsenmayer. 1996. dev. dyn. 206:260–271). certain of these showed homology with the “a” subunit of human plasma transglutaminase (factor xiiia), a member of a family of enzymes that cross-link a variety of intracellular and matrix molecules. we now have isolated a full-length cdna for this molecule, and confirmed that it is avian factor xiiia. northern and enzymatic analyses confirm that the molecule is upregulated in hypertrophic chondrocytes (as much as eightfold). the enzymatic analyses also show that appreciable transglutaminase activity in the hypertrophic zone becomes externalized into the extracellular matrix. this externalization most likely is effected by cell death and subsequent lysis—effected by the transglutaminase itself. when hypertrophic chondrocytes are transfected with a cdna construct encoding the zymogen of factor xiiia, the cells convert the translated protein to a lower molecular weight form, and they initiate cell death, become permeable to macromolecules and eventually undergo lysis. non-hypertrophic cells transfected with the same construct do not show these degenerative changes. these results suggest that hypertrophic chondrocytes have a novel, tissue-specific cascade of mechanisms that upregulate the synthesis of plasma transglutaminase and activate its zymogen. this produces autocatalytic cell death, externalization of the enzyme, and presumably cross-linking of components within the hypertrophic matrix. these changes may in turn regulate the removal and/or calcification of this hypertrophic matrix, which are its ultimate fates.
background and aims: attention to the development of children as the future generation that leads to the upbringing of productive human resources is an important subject. development has dimensions that a child should acquire the skills related to them in proper age. otherwise, he may be affected by developmental delays. there are different factors influencing children's developmental delays and this study is carried out to evaluate the developmental conditions of 1-year-old children in the isfahan and its effective factors. materials and methods: in a historical cohort, 725 children born in 2013 were selected using multi-stage random sampling from health centers licensed by isfahan medical university and followed up to 1-year and their related specifications were extracted from ages and stages questionnaire and their families’ files. spss 20 software and pearson and spearman correlation coefficients, independent t-tests, anova, multiple linear regression and analysis of covariance were used for analyzing the data. results: the minimum and maximum scores of development were observed in the personal-social domain (52.38 ± 9.1) and fine motor (56.06 ± 5.9), respectively. the results showed that the child spacing has direct relation with development in fine motor domain (r = 0.2, p < 0.001), personal-social development (r = 0.197, p = 0.001), and problem solving domain (r = 0.18, p = 0.002). the score for the development in gross motor skills had a direct correlation with the weight at birth (r = 0.129, p < 0.001). breastfeeding also improved personal-social development (p = 0.024). sex (p = 0.024) and living place with communication skills also showed significant relations (p < 0.001). conclusion: the factors such as the child's sex, feeding in the first 6 months of age, living in urban or rural areas are effective in delayed development. considering these factors to prevent adverse effects of the elements and rapid identification of children with delayed development as well as timely therapeutic interventions are essential in the health care system. the number of children at risk for delays in motor and social development (msd) associated with preterm delivery and low birthweight is increasing, but such children are generally not seen as being in need of evaluation. the objective of these analyses was to determine whether there are independent effects of birthweight and gestational age on msd and the magnitude of effects. subjects were a representative sample of 4621 us-born singleton children, aged 2-47 months, examined in the third national health and nutrition examination survey (1988-94). msd was assessed using an age-appropriate scale. birthweight and gestational age were taken from birth certificates. mexican-american and 'other' race/ethnicity (other than non-hispanic white, non-hispanic black or mexican-american), low parental education level, older maternal age, higher birth order, low birthweight (lbw, <2500 g) and preterm delivery (<37 weeks) were all found to be associated with significant (p < 0.01) delays in msd. three per cent of the infants and children were preterm lbw and 2.2% term lbw (<2500 g, 37-44 weeks). adjusting for socio-demographic factors, preterm lbw children had lower msd scores (-1.5 +/- 0.3 points, p < 0.0001) through early childhood, as did term lbw children (0.8 +/- 0.4 points, p < 0.03). for females, lbw was the most important perinatal predictor of a lowered score (-0.9 +/- 0.3 points compared with normal birthweight, p < 0.04). for males, scores were additionally decreased by -0.1 +/- 0.03 points/week (p=0.001) of early delivery. lbw children had less muscle mass, but adjusting for muscularity did not diminish the effects of birth size on msd. lbw status and preterm delivery are associated independently with small, but measurable, delays in msd through early childhood and should be considered along with other known risk factors for development delays in determining the need for developmental evaluation.
the body length and diameter of muscle fibres from the right hypaxial tail myomeres were measured in 100 sea bass larvae (dicentrarchus labrax, l.) at ages of 40 to 90 days, from a fish farm in croatia. the larvae were kept at a temperature of 19–20˚c and fed with standard feed for their respective ages. body lengths of larvae 40–90 days old varied from 8 to 42 mm, increasing significantly in 10-day intervals (p<0.001), except between days 50 and 60 when there was no increase in the body length. the measured diameters of muscle fibres ranged from 10 to 80 μm, the mean value increasing except between days 50 and 60. the fibre diameter in larvae aged up to 60 days was 10–40 μm, while that in larvae older than 70 days was 51–80 μm. in 90-day-old larvae there were no fibres of 10–20 μm in diameter; however, the number of fibers of 61–80 μm diameter increased. a statistically significant concordance was determined between the body length and fibre diameter of larvae 70 to 90 days old. between days 50 and 60, arrested growth of the larval body and corresponding decrease in fibre diameter was observed. from day 45 until days 59, larvae were fed with artemia nauplii and microparticles of formulated diets. from the day 60, minced fish was added to formulated diets. this change in diet probably resulted in the observed growth arrest. two genetically different populations of sea bass, dicentrarchus labrax l., atlantic (atl.) and mediterranean (med.), were subjected to the following incubation/cultivation temperatures (t): 15 °c/natural, 17 °c/natural, 15/19 °c, 17/19 °c (natural t averaging 15 °c and raising gradually). muscle cellularity was measured at different larval stages for each t regime. during the vitelline phase, muscle growth was mainly due to muscle fibre hypertrophy. in med. larvae, higher incubation t (17 °c) increased the area of white and red fibres at hatching, while in atl. larvae there was no significant t effect at this stage. at mouth opening, the area of white fibres increased at 19 °c in atl. larvae (p<0.05), but in med. larvae it was similar for all temperatures. following yolk-sac reabsorption, hypertrophy and hyperplasia increased in both populations. in these stages (20–55 days), both parameters were greater at 19 °c (p<0.05). metamorphosis finished earlier at 19 °c. at this stage, atl. larvae reared at 19 °c showed higher value of total myotomal area than at natural t, while in med. sea bass, larvae reared at 19 °c showed a lower size of the myotome than at 17 °c/natural. in larvae from both populations reared at natural t, incubating t had a positive effect at the end of metamorphosis, thus the total myotomal area were higher at 17 °c/natural than at 15 °c/natural. following metamorphosis, all groups showed a rapid growth, but higher at 19 °c (p<0.05). the results indicate that muscle cellularity was clearly influenced by t, and that both populations had different levels of response. these differences can be apparently associated with their respective genetic background.
infection with genus beta human papillomaviruses (hpv) is implicated in the development of non-melanoma skin cancer. this was first evidenced for hpv5 and 8 in patients with epidermodysplasia verruciformis (ev), a genetic skin disease. so far, it has been unknown how these viruses overcome cutaneous immune control allowing their persistence in lesional epidermis of these patients. here we demonstrate that langerhans cells, essential for skin immunosurveillance, are strongly reduced in hpv8-positive lesional epidermis from ev patients. interestingly, the same lesions were largely devoid of the important langerhans cells chemoattractant protein ccl20. applying bioinformatic tools, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and functional studies we identified the differentiation-associated transcription factor ccaat/enhancer binding protein β (c/ebpβ) as a critical regulator of ccl20 gene expression in normal human keratinocytes. the physiological relevance of this finding is supported by our in vivo studies showing that the expression patterns of ccl20 and nuclear c/ebpβ converge spatially in the most differentiated layers of human epidermis. our analyses further identified c/ebpβ as a novel target of the hpv8 e7 oncoprotein, which co-localizes with c/ebpβ in the nucleus, co-precipitates with it and interferes with its binding to the ccl20 promoter in vivo. as a consequence, the hpv8 e7 but not e6 oncoprotein suppressed c/ebpβ-inducible and constitutive ccl20 gene expression as well as langerhans cell migration. in conclusion, our study unraveled a novel molecular mechanism central to cutaneous host defense. interference of the hpv8 e7 oncoprotein with this regulatory pathway allows the virus to disrupt the immune barrier, a major prerequisite for its epithelial persistence and procarcinogenic activity. most nuclear proteins reside on a specific chromatin site only for seconds or less. the hit-and-run model of transcriptional control maintains that transcription complexes are assembled in a stochastic fashion from freely diffusible proteins; this contrasts to models involving stepwise assembly of stable holo complexes. however, the chances of forming a productive complex improve if the binding of one factor promotes the binding of its interactors. we prove here that in living cells, the glucocorticoid receptor and hmgb1 interact only within chromatin and not in the nucleoplasm and decrease each other's mobility. thus, the formation of a gr-hmgb1-chromatin complex is more likely than one would expect from independent binding to chromatin of gr and hmgb1. remarkably, this complex is potentially stable, and its disassembly is effected by active, atp-consuming processes. we propose that kinetic cooperativity among transcription factors in chromatin binding may be a common feature in transcription and dna transactions.
objective. to evaluate the performance of sequential organ failure assessment (sofa) score in cases of severe maternal morbidity (smm). design. retrospective study of diagnostic validation. setting. an obstetric intensive care unit (icu) in brazil. population. 673 women with smm. main outcome measures. mortality and sofa score. methods. organ failure was evaluated according to maximum score for each one of its six components. the total maximum sofa score was calculated using the poorest result of each component, reflecting the maximum degree of alteration in systemic organ function. results. highest total maximum sofa score was associated with mortality, 12.06 ± 5.47 for women who died and 1.87 ± 2.56 for survivors. there was also a significant correlation between the number of failing organs and maternal mortality, ranging from 0.2% (no failure) to 85.7% (≥3 organs). analysis of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve (auc) confirmed the excellent performance of total maximum sofa score for cases of smm (auc = 0.958). conclusions. total maximum sofa score proved to be an effective tool for evaluating severity and estimating prognosis in cases of smm. maximum sofa score may be used to conceptually define and stratify the degree of severity in cases of smm. study objectives to determine the incidence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (sirs) and organ failure and to describe the outcomes in critically ill obstetric patients who have been treated in medical icus.   design retrospective review.   setting a multidisciplinary icu at a tertiary-care institution.   methods we collected data on 74 obstetric patients who were admitted consecutively to the icu from january 1991 through december 1998. acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (apache) ii scores were calculated. a p value < 0.05 was considered to be significant.   measurements and results fifty-eight percent of patients were admitted to the icu postpartum. their mean (+/- sd) age was 25.9 +/- 7.0 years, and 64% were african american and 34% were white. fifty percent had preexisting medical conditions. their mean apache ii score was 14.0 +/- 5.9, and their predicted mortality rate was 17.6%. the most common reason for admission was respiratory insufficiency. preeclampsia was present in 38% of patients, and hemolytic anemia, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome were present in 7% of patients. sirs developed in 59% of patients. patients with sirs had longer icu stays (p = 0.0008). organ failure developed in 65% of patients, and ards developed in 15% of patients. invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 45% of patients, and pulmonary artery catheterization was required in 35% of patients. the in-hospital mortality rate was 2.7%. there were five spontaneous abortions and eight perinatal deaths.   conclusions the most common reason for admission to the icu of critically ill obstetric patients was respiratory failure. despite the severity of illness and the development of sirs and organ failure in most patients, the mortality rate was low.
behavioral studies proposed that prosodic information in speech sounds plays important roles for human infants to acquire their native languages. here, we examined the neural basis of prosodic processing in 3-month-old infants. in order to obtain hemodynamic responses with high signal-to-noise ratio, we used near-infrared optical topography in the infants while they were in quiet sleep. first, we observed bilateral activation under each of the normal and flattened speech conditions. the flattened speech sound was created by eliminating changes in the pitch contours of the original utterance. in a direct comparison between the two conditions, the right temporoparietal region showed more prominent activation to normal speech sounds than to flattened speech sounds. this result demonstrates that the localized region of the right hemisphere in 3-month-old infant is involved in the processing of pitch contours. our findings suggest that prosodic processing in the right hemisphere may facilitate the acquisition of lexical or syntactic knowledge in the early stages of language development. we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) to characterize cortical activation associated with sentence processing, thereby elucidating where in the brain auditory and visual inputs of words converge during sentence comprehension. within one scanning session, subjects performed three types of tasks with different linguistic components from perception to sentence comprehension: nonword (n(av); auditory and visual), phrase (p; either auditory or visual), and sentence (s; either auditory or visual) tasks. in a comparison of the p and n(av) tasks, the angular and supramarginal gyri showed bilateral activation, whereas the inferior and middle frontal gyri showed left-lateralized activation. a comparison of the s and p tasks, together with a conjunction analysis, revealed a ventral region of the left inferior frontal gyrus (f3t/f3o), which was sentence-processing selective and modality-independent. these results unequivocally demonstrated that the left f3t/f3o is involved in the selection and integration of semantic information that are separable from lexico-semantic processing.
objective in this article, we aim to (a) identify distinct trajectories of psychological distress in the first year after a breast cancer diagnosis in women treated with adjuvant therapy and (b) explore possible predictors of these trajectories, that is, demographic, medical, and personal characteristics.   method the 171 patients were assessed after diagnosis, after surgery, after adjuvant treatment, in the reentry phase, and in the (short-term) survivorship phase (2 and 6 months after the end of treatment, respectively).   main outcome measure psychological distress was assessed with the 12-item general health questionnaire.   results there were four trajectories of distress: a group that experienced no distress (36.3%), a group that experienced distress only in the active treatment phase (33.3%), a group that experienced distress in the reentry and survivorship phase (15.2%), and a group that experienced chronic distress (15.2%). personality and physical complaints resulting from adjuvant treatment could distinguish the distress trajectories. mastery was the only unique predictor.   conclusion most patients were not distressed in response to breast cancer or only temporarily so. yet, a minority of patients became or remained distressed after the end of treatment. depression is a significant problem for some breast cancer survivors after the end of treatment. this study assessed depression using the ces‐d for 84 breast cancer patients at the conclusion of radiation treatment, and at 3 and 6 months post‐treatment. based on the pattern of ces‐d scores, patients were divided into five groups: (1) stay depressed (scores above clinical cutoff for depression at all timepoints); (2) recover (above threshold at baseline, but below at follow‐up); (3) become depressed (below threshold at baseline, but above at follow‐up); (4) never depressed (below threshold at all times); and (5) vacillate (none of the above patterns). this study examined the relationships between depression groups and a variety of medical, demographic, and psychological measures, including anxiety and quality of life (qol). number of children at home significantly distinguished the groups, with the become depressed group having more children and the vacillate group having fewer children. anxiety levels were different among the groups, with recover and never depressed groups having consistently lower anxiety scores. qol scores also distinguished the groups in that never depressed patients demonstrated better qol than all other groups. the findings have implications for understanding resilience in cancer patients. copyright © 2005 john wiley & sons, ltd.
increased kraft pulp mill production generates increased solid wastes. in response, composting has emerged as an interesting alternative for disposal of these solid wastes. a central composite factor design was used to investigate the influence of incubation conditions (dregs addition and operation time) on chemical and biological parameters, determining the best in-vessel conditions in order to develop a correct composting design. dregs helped reduce the ph drop that occurs at the beginning of the process. biological activities presented high values during the active phase, followed by a decrease with stable final values along with n-nh(4)(+) and n-no(3)(-) trend, which were indicative of mature compost. dregs addition had not significant effect on the biological activities during composting of kraft mill sludge. however, moderate amounts of dregs (between 5% and 8%) at operation time of 60-70 days would be the best compromise. two-phase olive mill waste (tpomw) is a semisolid sludge generated during the extraction of olive oil by the two-phase centrifugation system. among all the available disposal options, composting is gaining interest as a sustainable strategy to recycle tpomw for agricultural purposes. the quality of compost for agronomical use depends on the degree of organic matter stabilization, but despite several studies on the topic, there is not a single method available which alone can give a certain indication of compost stability. in addition, information on the biological and biochemical properties, including the enzymatic activity (ea) of compost, is rare. the aim of this work was to investigate the suitability of some enzymatic activities (beta-glucosidase, arylsulphatase, acid-phosphatase, alkaline-phosphatase, urease and fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis (fda)) as parameters to evaluate organic matter stability during the composting of tpomw. these enzymatic indices were also compared to conventional stability indices. for this purpose two composting piles were prepared by mixing tpomw with sheep manure and grape stalks in different proportions, with forced aeration and occasional turnings. the composting of tpomw followed the common pattern reported previously for this kind of material with a reduction of 40-50% of organic matter, a gradual increase in ph, disappearance of phytotoxicity and formation of humic-like c. all ea increased during composting except acid-phosphatase. significant correlations were found between ea and some important conventional stability indices indicating that ea can be a simple and reliable tool to determine the degree of stability of tpomw composts.
glioblastoma (gbm) is the most common and aggressive malignant primary brain tumor and still lacks effective therapeutic strategies. it has already been shown that old drugs like sulfasalazine (sas) and valproic acid (vpa) present antitumoral activities in glioma cell lines. sas has also been associated with a decrease of intracellular glutathione (gsh) levels through a potent inhibition of xc- glutamate/cystine exchanger leading to an antioxidant deprotection. in the same way, vpa was recently identified as a histone deacetylase (hdat) inhibitor capable of activating tumor suppression genes. as both drugs are widely used in clinical practice and their profile of adverse effects is well known, the aim of our study was to investigate the effects of the combined treatment with sas and vpa in gbm cell lines. we observed that both drugs were able to reduce cell viability in a dose-dependent manner and the combined treatment potentiated these effects. combined treatment also increased cell death and inhibited proliferation of gbm cells, while having no effect on human and rat cultured astrocytes. also, we observed high protein expression of the catalytic subunit of xc- in all the examined gbm cell lines, and treatment with sas blocked its activity and decreased intracellular gsh levels. noteworthy, sas but not vpa was also able to reduce the [14c]-ascorbate uptake. together, these data indicate that sas and vpa exhibit a substantial effect on gbm cell’s death related to an intracellular oxidative response imbalance, making this combination of drugs a promising therapeutic strategy. temozolomide (tmz) is an oral alkylating agent that has been widely used in the treatment of refractory glioma, although inherent and acquired resistance to this drug is common. the clinical use of valproic acid (vpa) as an anticonvulsant and mood-stabilizing drug has been reported primarily for the treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder and less commonly for major depression. vpa is also used in the treatment of glioma-associated seizures with or without intracranial operation. in this study, we evaluated the potential synergistic effect of tmz and vpa in human glioma cell lines. compared with the use of tmz or vpa alone, concurrent treatment with both drugs synergistically induced apoptosis in u87mg cells as evidenced by p53 and bax expression, mitochondrial transmembrane potential loss, reactive oxygen species production, and glutathione depletion. this synergistic effect correlated with a decrease in nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor and corresponded with reduced heme oxygenase-1 and γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase expression. pretreatment with n-acetylcysteine partially recovered the apoptotic effect of the tmz/vpa combination treatment. the same degree of synergism is also seen in p53-mutant hs683 cells, which indicates that p53 may not play a major role in the increased proapoptotic effect of the tmz/vpa combination. in conclusion, vpa enhanced the apoptotic effect of tmz, possibly through a redox regulation mechanism. the tmz/vpa combination may be effective for treating glioma cancer and may be a powerful agent against malignant glioma. this drug combination should be further explored in the clinical setting.
study question does fibronectin (fn) stimulate the sperm capacitation process in humans?   summary answer fibronectin stimulates human sperm capacitation.   what is known already capacitation is a process that occurs in the oviduct. it has been suggested that some molecules present in the oviductal fluid and cells as well as proteins present in the cumulus oophorus could be involved in the modulation of sperm function and their acquisition of fertilizing capacity. fibronectin is a glycoprotein that is present in the fluid and the oviduct epithelium, and its receptor (alpha 5 beta 1 integrin) is present in human sperm. when alpha 5 beta 1 (α5β1) integrin binds to fibronectin, intracellular signals similar to the process of sperm capacitation are activated.   study design, size, duration human sperm were selected via a percoll gradient and were then incubated in non-capacitated medium (ncm) or reconstituted capacitated medium (rcm), in the presence or absence of fibronectin for different time periods. a total of 39 donors were used during the study, which lasted 3 years.   participants/materials, setting, methods freshly ejaculated sperm from healthy volunteers were obtained by masturbation. all semen samples were normal according to the world health organization parameters. six approaches were used to determine the effects of fibronectin on sperm capacitation: chlortetracycline (ctc) assay, heterologous co-culture of human sperm with bovine oviductal epithelial cells (boec), measurement of cyclic (c) amp levels, activity of protein kinase a (pka), phosphorylation of proteins in tyrosine (tyr) residues, and induction of acrosome reaction with progesterone.   main results and the role of chance when sperm were incubated in rcm in the presence of fn, we observed differences with respect to sperm incubated in rcm without fn (control): (i) a 10% increase in the percentage of sperm with the b pattern (capacitated sperm) of ctc fluorescence from the beginning of capacitation (p < 0.001); (ii) an effect on both the concentration of camp (p < 0.05) and pka activity (p < 0.05) during early capacitation; (iii) an increase in the degree of phosphorylation of proteins on tyrosine residues after 60 min of capacitation (p < 0.01); (iv) an increase in the percentage of acrosome-reacted sperm in response to progesterone (p < 0.05); and (v) a decrease in the percentage of sperm attached to boec (p < 0.05). moreover, we noted that the effect of fn was specific and mediated by alpha 5 beta 1 integrin (p < 0.001). fn by itself had no effect on sperm capacitation.   limitations, reasons for caution this study was carried out with sperm from young adult men. men with abnormal semen samples were excluded. the results cannot be directly extrapolated to other mammalian species.   wider implications of the findings currently, male subfertility has become a huge public health problem, which makes it imperative to develop new treatments. this is a novel discovery that extends our current knowledge concerning normal and pathological sperm physiology as well as events that regulate the process of fertilization.   study funding/competing interests this study was supported by grants from fondecyt (1130341, e.s.d. and 1120056, p.m.) and foncyt (pip 2011-0496, s.p.-m). the authors have no conflicts of interest. signal transduction pathways regulate various aspects of mammalian sperm function. when human sperm were incubated in a medium supporting capacitation, proteins became tyrosine-phosphorylated in a time-dependent manner. this phosphorylation was inhibited by genistein, a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor. phosphorylation was also reduced when sperm were incubated either in the presence of increasing concentrations of extracellular ca2+ or in a medium containing the ca2+ ionophore a23187. this ca2+-induced dephosphorylation was calmodulin-dependent, suggesting that calcineurin was involved. in this regard, the calcineurin inhibitor deltamethrin inhibited the ca2+ ionophore-induced dephosphorylation. a limited number of mr 80,000-105,000 polypeptides were the most prominent phosphotyrosine-containing proteins present in human sperm. unlike mouse sperm, which contains a tyrosine-phosphorylated isoform of hexokinase, a phosphotyrosine-containing hexokinase in human sperm was not detected. most of the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were triton x-100-insoluble and were localized to the principal piece of the flagellum, the region where the cytoskeletal fibrous sheath is found. prominent phosphotyrosine-containing proteins of mr 82,000 and 97,000 were identified as the human homologues of mouse sperm akap82, the major fibrous sheath protein, and pro-akap82, its precursor polypeptide, respectively. these proteins are a kinase anchor proteins, polypeptides that sequester protein kinase a to subcellular locations. taken together, these results suggest that protein tyrosine phosphorylation may be part of a signal transduction cascade(s) regulating events pertaining to capacitation and/or motility in mammalian sperm and that an interrelationship between tyrosine kinase and camp signaling pathways exists in these cells.
imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging seek to estimate neural signals in local brain regions through measurements of hemodynamic activity. however, hemodynamic activity is accompanied by large vascular fluctuations of unclear significance. to characterize these fluctuations and their impact on estimates of neural signals, we used optical imaging in visual cortex of awake mice. we found that hemodynamic activity can be expressed as the sum of two components, one local and one global. the local component reflected presumed neural signals driven by visual stimuli in the appropriate retinotopic region. the global component constituted large fluctuations shared by larger cortical regions, which extend beyond visual cortex. these fluctuations varied from trial to trial, but they did not constitute noise; they correlated with pupil diameter, suggesting that they reflect variations in arousal or alertness. distinguishing local and global contributions to hemodynamic activity may help understand neurovascular coupling and interpret measurements of hemodynamic responses. potential contributions of concurrently acquired pupil dilation data to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) experiments were examined. sixteen healthy participants completed a working memory task (digit sorting) during measurement of pupil dilation outside the fmri environment and during concurrent 3t fmri assessment. pupil dilation increased parametrically with task difficulty inside and outside the scanner, on a similar time course, suggesting that task demand was similar in both environments. the time course of pupil dilation during digit sorting was similar to the time course of the fmri signal in the middle frontal gyrus, suggesting that middle-frontal gyrus activity indexed the engagement working memory processes. incorporating individual differences in pupil dilation improved the sensitivity and specificity of general linear modeling analyses of activity in the middle frontal gyrus, above and beyond standard analytic techniques. results suggest concurrent pupil dilation during fmri assessment can help to (1) specify whether task demand is the same inside and outside the fmri environment, (2) resolve the extent to which fmri signals reflect different aspects of event-related designs, and (3) explain variation in fmri data due to individual differences in information processing.
backgroundoculocutaneous albinism (oca) is a clinically and genetically heterogenic group of pigmentation abnormalities characterized by variable hair, skin, and ocular hypopigmentation. six known genes and a locus on human chromosome 4q24 have been implicated in the etiology of isolated oca forms (oca 1–7).methodsthe most frequent oca types among caucasians are oca1, oca2, and oca4. we aimed to investigate genes responsible for the development of these oca forms in hungarian oca patients (n = 13). mutation screening and polymorphism analysis were performed by direct sequencing on tyr, oca2, slc45a2 genes.resultsalthough the clinical features of the investigated hungarian oca patients were identical, the molecular genetic data suggested oca1 subtype in eight cases and oca4 subtype in two cases. the molecular diagnosis was not clearly identifiable in three cases. in four patients, two different heterozygous known pathogenic or predicted to be pathogenic mutations were present. seven patients had only one pathogenic mutation, which was associated with non-pathogenic variants in six cases. in two patients no pathogenic mutation was identified.conclusionsour results suggest that the concomitant screening of the non-pathogenic variants—which alone do not cause the development of oca, but might have clinical significance in association with a pathogenic variant—is important. our results also show significant variation in the disease spectrum compared to other populations. these data also confirm that the concomitant analysis of oca genes is critical, providing new insights to the phenotypic diversity of oca and expanding the mutation spectrum of oca genes in hungarian patients. oculocutaneous albinism (oca) is a rare genetic disorder of melanin synthesis that results in hypopigmented hair, skin, and eyes. there are four types of oca caused by mutations in tyr (oca‐1), oca2 (oca‐2), tyrp1 (oca‐3), or slc45a2 (oca‐4). here we report 22 novel mutations in the oca genes; 14 from a cohort of 61 patients seen as part of the nih oca natural history study and eight from a prior study at the university of minnesota. we also include a comprehensive list of almost 600 previously reported oca mutations along with ethnicity information, carrier frequencies, and in silico pathogenicity predictions as a supplement. in addition to discussing the clinical and molecular features of oca, we address the cases of apparent missing heritability. in our cohort, 26% of patients did not have two mutations in a single oca gene. we demonstrate the utility of multiple detection methods to reveal mutations missed by sanger sequencing. finally, we review the tyr p.r402q temperature‐sensitive variant and confirm its association with cases of albinism with only one identifiable tyr mutation.
objective the purpose of this study was to describe changes of health status as perceived by clients with hand or wrist impairments who received rehabilitation in acute, orthopedic outpatient facilities from occupational therapy or physical therapy personnel.   method one thousand three hundred ninety-nine adults with wrist (n = 692) or hand (n = 707) impairments who were treated between july 1996 and june 1997 were selected from the focus on therapeutic outcomes, inc. (foto) national rehabilitation database. each client completed a health status questionnaire on intake and discharge. data consisted of number of outpatient visits, duration of treatment episode, and health status scores for six functional scales. measures of intensity, global health status, global utilization, and client satisfaction were calculated. outcomes were evaluated across occupational therapists and physical therapists.   results clients perceived improvement (p < .05) in their health status over the course of therapy. number of visits and measures of health status and client satisfaction were similar across type of therapist. episode duration was longer (p < .05) and intensity was less (p < .05) for clients seen by occupational therapists.   conclusion clients receiving rehabilitation in acute orthopedic outpatient centers perceived improvement in their functional abilities and health and well-being (global health status and individual functional scales) over the time during which treatment was provided. results confirm the responsiveness of the outcomes instrument to clinical change in the clients' perception of their health status over the course of therapy and support the use of health status as a measure of clinical outcome. study design effect of clinical specialization was studied in a retrospective analysis of a commercial outcomes database.   objective to assess effectiveness of care as measured by changes in health status and efficiency as measured by visits, duration of treatment episode, and net revenue between patients treated by clinicians with and without orthopaedic clinical specialist certification (ocs).   background clinical specialization is becoming common in physical therapy, but there are no studies to support improved efficiency or effectiveness with advanced practitioner competencies.   methods and measures a total of 258 adults treated in practices participating in the focus on therapeutic outcomes process during 1996 comprised the data set. seven physical therapists with ocs treated 129 patients (clinical specialist group). these patients were matched to 129 patients not treated by physical therapists with ocs (comparison group) randomly chosen from the aggregate data set. all patients completed a standardized health status questionnaire at initial evaluation and discharge. standardized response means (srms) were calculated to measure change during treatment.   results therapists with ocs were more efficient than therapists without ocs, using fewer visits (9.1 +/- 6.7 vs 11.2 +/- 7.4) for less estimated cost ($949 +/- $736 vs $1238 +/- $1227) during the same treatment duration (35.9 +/- 48.3 vs 35.4 +/- 25.6 days) and performed fewer treatment procedures. overall, there was no difference in effectiveness as measured by change in health status, that is, unit of functional improvement per episode (0.89 +/- 1.0 srm for clinical specialists compared with 0.88 +/- 1.0 srm for comparison group). the ocs group had better value (unit of functional improvement per estimated dollar) and utilization (unit of functional improvement per visit) for the constructs of physical functioning (value: 1.31 +/- 2.7 vs 0.78 +/- 1.8; utilization: 1.25 +/- 2.2 vs 0.76 +/- 1.6) and role physical (value: 1.26 +/- 2.9 vs 0.44 +/- 3.5; utilization: 1.11 +/- 1.9 vs 0.51 +/- 2.3) (srms for ocs group vs comparison group, respectively).   conclusions our data support the conclusion that physical therapists with ocs are more efficient compared with clinicians without ocs. study limitations in design, small sample size, and low number of clinicians are discussed.
backgroundchildren with cardiac defects need many hospitalizations and repetitive antibiotic therapies, with an increasing risk of colonization with multidrug-resistant bacteria (mdrb) such as extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae (esbl-e) post-operative infections with these bacteria in paediatric cardiac surgery are life threatening. this article aims to study the prevalence of esbl colonization among paediatric cardiac surgery patients, and to compare occurrence of post-operative infections with and without esbl colonization. we also aim to study the correlation between the onset of postoperative infection and other parameters such as age, length of stay and preoperative antibiotic therapy.methodsa retrospective cohort study included paediatric cardiac surgery patients in cheikh zaid hospital in rabat, morocco, between the 1st of january 2011 and 31 december 2014. a screening for esbl colonization was requested for children who had a risk factor (previous hospitalization and/or taking antibiotics) at admission. swabs were collected from three sites (throat, nose and anus). two groups were compared – patients colonized and not colonized with esbls. statistical analysis was performed using r software.resultsesbl colonization screening was performed in 111 patients. positive colonization was detected in 17 cases (15%). klebsiella pneumoniae (kp): 9 (53%) was the most frequently isolated species. among the 17 patients, 23.5% (4/17) developed a postoperative infection due to esbls versus only one patient without colonization (1%).there was a statically significant difference in terms of occurrence of postoperative infection between the two groups (p = 0.001). relative risk of developing a postoperative infection with positive colonization was 22 (95% ci, 8.37–58.5).conclusionsthe analysis of colonization with multidrug-resistant bacteria and the prevention of nosocomial infections appear to be important challenges for paediatric cardiac surgery. systematic screening of esbl colonization for cardiac surgery could have a significant contribution, on one hand to guide prophylactic antibiotic therapy of patients, and on the other, to prevent spread of those infections. introduction the incidence of multidrug resistant microorganisms worldwide is increasing. the aim of the study was to present institutional experience with the multidrug resistant microorganism colonization patterns observed in children with congenital heart diseases hospitalized in a hybrid pediatric cardiac surgery center. material and methods microbiological samples were routinely collected in all children admitted to our department. all microbiological samples were analyzed with regard to multidrug resistant microorganisms: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre), gram-negative rods producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl), multidrug resistant gram-negative rods (mdr-gnrs), carbapenemase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae (kpc), carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii (crab) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (crpa). results in 30 (9%) swabs ‘alert’ pathogens from the above group of listed microorganisms were found. all positive swabs were isolated in 19 (16.1%) children. multidrug resistant pathogen colonization was statistically significantly more often observed in children admitted from other medical facilities than in children admitted from home (38% vs. 10%, p = 0.0089). in the group of children younger than 6 months ‘alert’ pathogen were more often observed than in older children (34.1% vs. 5.4%, p < 0.001). conclusions preoperative multidrug resistant pathogen screening in children admitted and referred for congenital heart disease procedures may be of great importance since many of these patients are colonized with resistant bacteria. knowledge of the patient's microbiome is important in local epidemiological control along with tailoring the most effective preoperative prophylactic antibiotic for each patient. the impact of preoperative screening on postoperative infections and other complications requires further analysis.
backgroundtyphoid fever is a systemic illness which in high-income countries mainly affects travellers. the incidence is particularly high on the indian subcontinent. travellers who visit friends and relatives (vfr) have been shown to have a different risk profile than others. we wished to identify main characteristics for travellers infected with s. typhi considering both clinical and laboratory findings in order to provide for faster and better diagnostics in the future. the outcome of treatment, especially concerning relapse, was evaluated as well.methodsretrospectively collected data from 19 adult cases of typhoid fever over a 5-year period at the department of infectious diseases, copenhagen university hospital, hvidovre denmark.resultsthe patients were young adults, presenting with symptoms within a month after travelling. 84% were returned from travelling in the indian subcontinent. 17 out of 19 patients were vfr-travellers. the main symptoms were fever (100%), gastrointestinal symptoms (84%), headache (58%) and dry cough (26%). laboratory findings showed elevated c-reactive protein (crp) and lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) in all cases and elevated alanine transaminase (alat) in 47% of cases. in primary cases 4 isolates were fully susceptible to ciprofloxacin, the remaining were intermediate susceptible. relapse occurred in 37% of the cases and only in cases where the patient was infected by a strain with intermediate susceptibility.conclusionsbetter pre-travel counselling should be given to vfr-travellers. the main symptoms and laboratory findings confirm previous findings. the relapse rate was unexpected high and could be correlated to ciprofloxacin-resistance. we reviewed 232 consecutive patients admitted to a tertiary-care hospital under the care of an infectious diseases unit for management of febrile illness acquired overseas. a total of 53% presented to hospital within 1 week of return and 96% within 6 months. malaria was the most common diagnosis (27% of patients), followed by respiratory tract infection (24%), gastroenteritis (14%), dengue fever (8%), and bacterial pneumonia (6%). pretravel vaccination may have prevented a number of admissions, including influenza (n=11), typhoid fever (n=8) and hepatitis a (n=6). compared to those who had not traveled to africa, those who had were 6 times more likely to present with falciparum than nonfalciparum malaria. an itinerary that included asia was associated with a 13-fold increased risk of dengue, but a lower risk of malaria. palpable splenomegaly was associated with an 8-fold risk of malaria and hepatomegaly with a 4-fold risk of malaria. as a cause of fever, bacterial pneumonia was > or =5 times more likely in those who were aged >40 years.
the thoraces of males and flightless females of the geometrid winter moth nyssiodes lefuarius are described, documented in detail, and compared. morphological, functional, and evolutionary aspects of the female phenotype are discussed. the flightlessness of female n. lefuarius is linked not only with complex modifications of the skeletomuscular structure, especially elements of the flight apparatus, but also with greatly enlarged ovaries and a reduced gut. compared with other flightless female lepidopterans, females of n. lefuarius display a specific thoracic skeletomuscular configuration, which strongly suggests independent evolution, in agreement with the phylogenetic pattern. the evolutionary scenario of flight ability enhancement in lepidoptera is demonstrated using a combined phylogeny from recent studies based on molecular data. thoracic skeletomuscular characters are compiled and mapped, mainly using extensive information from the literature, but also including the new morphological data obtained from the male n. lefuarius. important changes in the thoracic character system are linked with the rise of coelolepida, heteroneura, and ditrysia. only minor changes take place in the character system in more advanced groups of lepidoptera. a highly unusual feature is the secondarily stiff wing type in some groups of ditrysia without the neopteran basal folding mechanism. the morphological background of the secondarily evolved “palaeopteran” condition is a complex of different character changes. major problems in the reconstruction of the phylogeny are a high degree of homoplasy and missing detailed data for several crucial taxa emerging close to the root of the order. in order to facilitate the study of the evolution of female flightlessness among the geometrid subfamily ennominae (lepidoptera, geometridae), we carried out a phylogenetic analysis based on a morphological data matrix, and dna sequences. we used seven nuclear gene fragments, elongation factor 1alpha (ef-1alpha), wingless (wgl), isocitrate dehydrogenase (idh), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh), ribosomal protein s5 (rps5) and segments d1 and d2 of the 28s rrna gene, and one mitochondrial gene fragment, cytochrome oxidase subunit i (coi). sampling included 55 species of ennominae covering all tribes with flightless females of the holarctic boreal zone, and some other geometrids used as outgroups. our results clearly confirmed that ennominae (including alsophila of the traditional subfamily alsophilinae) is a monophyletic group, as well as supported the previously established morphology-based division of ennominae into "ennomine" and "boarmiine" groups of genera. a number of taxonomic ambiguities were resolved but the monophyly of the traditionally recognised tribe bistonini, comprising a number of flightless species, remained ambiguous. bistonini is thus suggested to be subsumed to the tribe boarmiini in the broad sense. indeed, an analysis of timing of divergence suggested that boarmiini s. lat. rapidly diversified in the late oligocene/early miocene. within the ennominae, seven independent origins of female flightlessness were revealed facilitating phylogenetic comparative analyses to be performed in search of causes and consequences of this phenomenon. the present phylogenetic hypothesis supports the conclusions of the "adaptive story", a hypothesis of the sequence of evolutionary events leading to flightlessness, we have presented earlier (snäll et al., 2007). in particular, in the "boarmiine" group, the tribe boarmiini s. lat. clearly represents a group of geometrids in which female flightlessness has evolved more frequently than in any other tribes, suggesting that this clade has likely been predisposed to evolutionary events leading to the manifestation of female flightlessness. the ancestor of the wing-reduced ennominae has likely been a winged but slow flying forest moth feeding polyphagously on deciduous trees.
we investigate the properties of multifractal products of geometric gaussian processes with possible long-range dependence and geometric ornstein–uhlenbeck processes driven by levy motion and their finite and infinite superpositions. we present the general conditions for the lq convergence of cumulative processes to the limiting processes and investigate their qth order moments and renyi functions, which are non-linear, hence displaying the multifractality of the processes as constructed. we also establish the corresponding scenarios for the limiting processes, such as log-normal, log-gamma, log-tempered stable or log-normal tempered stable scenarios. in various fields, such as teletraffic and economics, measured time series have been reported to adhere to multifractal scaling. classical cascading measures possess multifractal scaling, but their increments form a nonstationary process. to overcome this problem, we introduce a construction of random multifractal measures based on iterative multiplication of stationary stochastic processes, a special form of t-martingales. we study the ℒ2-convergence, nondegeneracy, and continuity of the limit process. establishing a power law for its moments, we obtain a formula for the multifractal spectrum and hint at how to prove the full formalism.
mycophenolic acid (mpa) is the active immunosuppressive metabolite of the anti-organ rejection drug mycophenolate mofetil (mmf) and is implicated in the gastrointestinal toxicity associated with mmf therapy. intestinal udp-glucuronosyltransferases (ugt) have been proposed to provide intrinsic resistance against mmf-induced gastrointestinal toxicity by converting mpa to the inactive mpa 7-o-glucuronide. using an optimized intestinal microsome preparation method that stabilized the intestinal mpa ugt activity, the mpa ugt activity of male sprague-dawley rat intestinal microsomes was characterized. a longitudinal gradient similar to that described for other phenolic compounds was observed, with the activity decreasing from the duodenum to the distal small intestine and colon. the catalytic efficiency of mpa glucuronidation decreased from the proximal to distal intestine as a result of decreasing vmax and increasing km. the finding that homozygous gunn rats lack detectable intestinal mpa ugt activity indicates exclusive roles of ugt1a1, ugt1a6, and/or ugt1a7. quantitative immunoblotting revealed a parallel between the mpa ugt activity and the content of ugt1a7-like immunoreactivity (18.7 and 7.3 μg/mg for duodenum and colon, respectively). in contrast, the lesser mpa-metabolizing ugt, ugt1a1 and ugt1a6, were lower in abundance (1.6–2.1 and 1.7–2.9 μg/mg, respectively), and their patterns of longitudinal distribution were distinct from the mpa ugt activity. these data suggest a dominant role of a ugt1a7-like enzyme, presumably ugt1a7 itself, in the catalysis of rat intestinal mpa glucuronidation. studies are ongoing to investigate the relationship between intestinal ugt1a enzymes and susceptibility to mmf-induced gastrointestinal toxicity. gastrointestinal surgery was used in order to determine the role of normal food components, bile and pancreatic secretion in the control of mucosal glucuronide synthesis. furthermore a few rats were treated either intragastrically or intraperitoneally with phenobarbitone. both the rate of o-aminophenyl glucuronide synthesis in slices and the activity of udp glucuronyltransferase in mucosal extracts were studied. in partial jejunectomies no changes were found in glucuronide synthesis when compared with the controls, but in jejunal thiry-vella loops and in duodenal and jejunal blind sacs the glucuronide synthesis rate was significantly lower. in gastro-jejunostomized rats a transient increase in the glucuronide synthesis rate was noted in the gastro-jejunostomy area. phenobarbitone administration did not increase the small intestinal udp glucuronyltransferase activity when administered either intraperitoneally or intragastrically. the results indicate that the chyme factors are of importance in the control of glucuronide synthesis in the small intestine of the rat, but that phenobarbitone has no effect.
rehabilitation services are less-studied aspects of the management following total knee arthroplasty (tka) despite long-term suboptimal physical functioning and chronic deficits in muscle function. this paper describes the preliminary findings of a six-week (12 session) eccentrically-biased rehabilitation program targeted at deficits in physical function and muscle function, initiated one month following surgery. a quasiexperimental, one group, pretest-posttest study with thirteen individuals (6 female, 7 male; mean age 57 ± 7 years) examined the effectiveness of an eccentrically-biased rehabilitation program. the program resulted in improvements in the primary physical function endpoints (sf-36 physical component summary and the six-minute walk test) with increases of 59% and 47%, respectively. muscle function endpoints (knee extension strength and power) also increased 107% and 93%, respectively. eccentrically-biased exercise used as an addition to rehabilitation may help amplify and accelerate physical function following tka surgery. background context in the last decade, the number of patients undergoing surgical treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis (lss), particularly instrumented fusions, has significantly increased. the surgical procedures for lss represent a significant cost to the health-care system and are a priority focus for most governments, insurers, hospital administrators, and spine care physicians.   purpose the purpose of this study was to directly compare the relative improvement in self-reported quality of life after surgical intervention for matched groups of patients with primary hip or knee osteoarthritis (h-oa/k-oa) and focal lumbar spinal stenosis (flss).   study design/setting observational cohort study of prospectively collected outcomes.   patient sample patients, following elective primary one- to two-level spinal decompression (n=90) with (n=28/90) or without fusion for flss, were compared with a matched (age, sex, and time of surgery) cohort of patients who had undergone elective total hip (n=90) or total knee (n=90) arthroplasty (total joint arthroplasty [tja]) for primary osteoarthritis.   outcome measures medical outcomes study short form-36 (sf-36).   methods patents were obtained for prospective outcomes databases (tja and spine). inclusion and exclusion criteria were independently applied, and matching was performed in a blinded fashion. the primary outcome measure was the relative change between preoperative and 2-year postoperative sf-36 questionnaires. data were analyzed with the t test and repeated measures analysis of variance (anova).   results the three groups (flss/h-oa/k-oa) were equally matched with respect to mean age (64/63/65 years), sex (female/male, 51/39 for all groups), body mass index (bmi) (27/24/27), and american society of anesthesiologists (asa) physical status (2/2/2). comparison of preoperative sf-36 physical component summary (pcs) scores and mental component summary (mcs) scores between groups showed no statistical difference (pcs: flss=32.0, h-oa=30.2, k-oa=31.3 [p=.32, anova]/mcs: flss=43.5, h-oa=45.0, k-oa=46.2 [p=.25, anova]). postoperatively, pcs improved significantly for all groups (1 year-pcs: flss=39.6, h-oa=44.5, k-oa=38.5 [p<.0001 for all groups]; 2 years-pcs: flss=38.6, h-oa=43.2, k-oa=37.1 [p<.0001 for all groups]). at both 1- and 2-year follow-ups, the pcs improvement between groups was greater for the h-oa group compared with the flss (p=.0037, p=.0073) and k-oa (p=.00016, p=.00053) groups. at the 1-year follow-up, mcs did not significantly increase for any group; however, 2 years postoperatively, mcs improved significantly for the flss and h-oa groups (2 years-mcs: flss=50.3, h-oa=50.9, k-oa=44.8 [p=.00021, p=.00079, p=.35]). at the 1-year follow-up, there was no statistical difference in mcs improvement between groups (p=.45, anova). two years postoperatively, the mcs for both the flss and h-oa groups was significantly greater than that for the k-oa group (p=.0014, p=.00055).   conclusions the results of this study show that surgical intervention for flss can obtain and maintain improvement in self-reported quality of life comparable to that of total hip and knee arthroplasty. this study provides data to support the need for prospective cost-effectiveness studies for the surgical management of appropriately selected patients suffering from flss.
abstract    macrophages are an important natural target cell for hiv-1, but previous studies of virus entry into these cells are limited, and the involvement of membrane cholesterol and lipid rafts is unknown. cholesterol disruption of macrophage membranes using four pharmacological agents acting by different mechanisms: methyl-β cyclodextrin, nystatin, filipin complex and lovastatin, all significantly inhibited productive hiv entry and reverse transcription. the inhibitory effects of these drugs resulted in decreased virus release from infected cells, and could be substantially reversed by the addition of water-soluble cholesterol. the virus bound equally to cholesterol-disrupted cells even though hiv receptor expression levels were significantly reduced. macrophage cd4 and ccr5 were found to partition with the detergent-resistant membranes with a typical raft-associating protein flotillin-1. hiv particles were observed co-localising with a marker of lipid rafts (ctb-fitc) early post infection. these data suggest that macrophage membrane cholesterol is essential for hiv entry, and implicate lipid raft involvement. rice mutant database (rmd, ) is an archive for collecting, managing and searching information of the t-dna insertion mutants generated by an enhancer trap system. we have generated ∼129 000 rice mutant (enhancer trap) lines that are now being gathered in the database. information collected in rmd includes mutant phenotypes, reporter-gene expression patterns, flanking sequences of t-dna insertional sites, seed availability and others, and can be searched by respective id, keyword, nucleotide sequence or protein sequence on the website. this database is both a mutant collection for identifying novel genes and regulatory elements and a pattern line collection for ectopic expression of target gene in specific tissue or at specific growth stage.
the ability to inhibit irrelevant information is essential for coping with the demands of everyday life. inhibitory deficits are present in all stages of dementia and commonly observed in people with parkinson's disease (pwpd). inhibition is frequently tested with the stroop test, but this may lack ecological validity. this study investigates inhibitory control in people with alzheimer's disease dementia (pwd) and pwpd using the hayling sentence completion test (hsct), which aspires to be a more ecologically valid task. a total of 117 people completed the hsct, a test where participants have to complete a sentence with an unrelated word. the sample comprised 30 pwd, 33 pwpd, and 54 healthy older controls. we compared response times and the number and type of errors across the three groups. completion time in part b (inhibition) did not distinguish between pwd, pwpd, and controls when controlling for the initiation speed, but a higher proportion of category a errors (producing a word that fits the sentence when instructed otherwise) was a unique characteristic of inferior performance in pwd and pwpd. while not part of the standard test scoring protocol, controlling for the initiation speed and distinguishing between speed and accuracy in test performance appear to be essential for accurate evaluation of the inhibitory control in hsct in older people. the findings suggest that the hsct may be sensitive to verbal suppression deficits and may provide insight into inhibitory control in pwd and pwpd. successful communication requires speakers to consider their listeners׳ perspectives. little is known about how this ability changes in alzheimer׳s disease (ad) although such knowledge could reveal the cognitive mechanisms fundamental to perspective-taking ability, and reveal which cognitive deficits are fundamental to communication disorders in ad. patients with mild to moderate ad and age and education matched controls were tested in a communicative perspective-taking task, and on measures of executive control, general cognitive functioning, and lexical retrieval. patients׳ ability to perform the perspective-taking task was significantly correlated with performance on measures of general cognitive functioning, visual scanning and construction, response conflict and attention. measures of lexical retrieval tended not to be correlated with performance on the communication task with one exception: semantic but not letter fluency predicted a derived score of perspective-taking ability. these findings broaden our understanding of the cognitive mechanisms underlying perspective taking, and suggest that impairments in perspective taking in ad occur during utterance planning, and at a relatively early processing stage which involves rapid visual scanning and problem solving, rather than during retrieval of lexical items needed to speak. more broadly, these data reveal executive function and semantic deficits, but not problems with lexical retrieval, as more fundamental to the basis of cognitive changes associated with ad.
the ability to use information about the uncertainty of future outcomes is critical for adaptive behavior in an uncertain world. we show that the basal forebrain (bf) contains at least two distinct neural-coding strategies to support this capacity. the dorsal-lateral bf, including the ventral pallidum (vp), contains reward-sensitive neurons, some of which are selectively suppressed by uncertain-reward predictions (u−). in contrast, the medial bf (mbf) contains reward-sensitive neurons, some of which are selectively enhanced (u+) by uncertain-reward predictions. in a two-alternative choice-task, u− neurons were selectively suppressed while monkeys chose uncertain options over certain options. during the same choice-epoch, u+ neurons signaled the subjective reward value of the choice options. additionally, after the choice was reported, u+ neurons signaled reward uncertainty until the choice outcome. we suggest that uncertainty-related suppression of vp may participate in the mediation of uncertainty-seeking actions, whereas uncertainty-related enhancement of the mbf may direct cognitive resources to monitor and learn from uncertain-outcomes. significance statement to survive in an uncertain world, we must approach uncertainty and learn from it. here we provide evidence for two mostly distinct mechanisms for processing uncertainty about rewards within different subregions of the primate basal forebrain (bf). we found that uncertainty suppressed the representation of certain (or safe) reward values by some neurons in the dorsal-lateral bf, in regions occupied by the ventral pallidum. this uncertainty-related suppression was evident as monkeys made risky choices. we also found that uncertainty-enhanced the activity of many medial bf neurons, most prominently after the monkeys' choices were completed (as they awaited uncertain outcomes). based on these findings, we propose that different subregions of the bf could support action and learning under uncertainty in distinct but complimentary manners. it has been suggested that the basal forebrain (bf) exerts strong influences on the formation of memory and behavior. however, what information is used for the memory-behavior formation is unclear. we found that a population of neurons in the medial bf (medial septum and diagonal band of broca) of macaque monkeys encodes a unique combination of information: reward uncertainty, expected reward value, anticipation of punishment, and unexpected reward and punishment. the results were obtained while the monkeys were expecting (often with uncertainty) a rewarding or punishing outcome during a pavlovian procedure, or unexpectedly received an outcome outside the procedure. in vivo anterograde tracing using manganese-enhanced mri suggested that the major recipient of these signals is the intermediate hippocampal formation. based on these findings, we hypothesize that the medial bf identifies various contexts and outcomes that are critical for memory processing in the hippocampal formation.
previous confirmatory factor analytic research that has examined the factor structure of the wechsler adult intelligence scale–fourth edition (wais-iv) has endorsed either higher order models or oblique factor models that tend to amalgamate both general factor and index factor sources of systematic variance. an alternative model that has not yet been examined for the wais-iv is the bifactor model. bifactor models allow all subtests to load onto both the general factor and their respective index factor directly. bifactor models are also particularly amenable to the estimation of model-based reliabilities for both global composite scores (ω h ) and subscale/index scores (ω s ). based on the wais-iv normative sample correlation matrices, a bifactor model that did not include any index factor cross loadings or correlated residuals was found to be better fitting than the conventional higher order and oblique factor models. although the ω h estimate associated with the full scale intelligence quotient (fsiq) scores was respectably high (.86), the ω s estimates associated with the wais-iv index scores were very low (.13 to .47). the results are interpreted in the context of the benefits of a bifactor modeling approach. additionally, in light of the very low levels of unique internal consistency reliabilities associated with the index scores, it is contended that clinical index score interpretations are probably not justifiable. the present study examined the factor structure of the wechsler adult intelligence scale--fourth edition (wais-iv; d. wechsler, 2008a) standardization sample using exploratory factor analysis, multiple factor extraction criteria, and higher order exploratory factor analysis (j. schmid & j. m. leiman, 1957) not included in the wais-iv technical and interpretation manual (d. wechsler, 2008b). results indicated that the wais-iv subtests were properly associated with the theoretically proposed first-order factors, but all but one factor-extraction criterion recommended extraction of one or two factors. hierarchical exploratory analyses with the schmid and leiman procedure found that the second-order g factor accounted for large portions of total and common variance, whereas the four first-order factors accounted for small portions of total and common variance. it was concluded that the wais-iv provides strong measurement of general intelligence, and clinical interpretation should be primarily at that level.
purpose to explore the effects of light exposure and deprivation on the distribution and function of microglia in the subretinal space of mice.   methods using a monoclonal antibody, 5d4, that identifies resting, ramified microglia, the distribution and density of microglia in the retina, and the subretinal space were determined by confocal microscopy and by immunohistochemistry of cryopreserved sections of eyes of albino and pigmented mice exposed to diverse levels of light, ranging from complete darkness to intense brightness. axotomized retinal ganglion cells were retrograde labeled by fluorescent tracer to determine whether the marker colocalizes to 5d4+ cells. electron microscopy was used to evaluate microglia for evidence of phagocytosis.   results 5d4+ microglia in pigmented eyes were limited to the inner retinal layers, but in albino eyes 5d4+ cells were found in the outer retinal layers and subretinal space as well. the subretinal space of eyes of albino mice raised from birth in complete darkness contained few 5d4+ cells, but exposure to light caused the rapid accumulation of 5d4+ cells at this site. 5d4+ cell density in the subretinal space correlated directly with intensity of ambient light. retrograde labeling of axotomized ganglion cells resulted in 5d4+ cells in the subretinal space that contained the retrograde label. subretinal microglia contained phagocytized rod outer segment discs. on intense light exposure, 5d4+ cells adopted an active morphology, but failed to express class ii major histocompatibility complex (mhc) molecules.   conclusions light exposure induced retinal microglia migration into the subretinal space in albino mice. subretinal microglia appeared to augment through phagocytosis the capacity of pigment epithelium to take up the photoreceptor debris of light toxicity. the unexpected presence of these cells in the subretinal space raises questions concerning their potential contribution to immune privilege in this space and to the fate of retinal transplants. this study determined the minimum cyclic (12l:12d) light intensity which produces retinal damage in albino (sprague-dawley) rats raised from birth to 15 weeks of age under 6 lx (12l:12d). four experimental light intensities were tested, viz. 1345, 270, 130 and 65 lx. control animals remained under 6 lx. after various durations of exposure to one of the intensities tested, the retinas of groups of six rats were evaluated for physiological and morphological evidence of light damage. the indices of damage were: (1) histological and morphometric changes in the retina, and (2) changes in the amplitude and latency of the b-wave of the electroretinogram. light intensities of 1345- or 270 lx severely damage retinas of albino rats raised from birth under 6 lx within 3-7 days of the initiation of light exposure. exposure to 130- or 65 lx produced much less dramatic changes in the responsiveness and morphology of the retina that did not appear to be permanent. based on these results, a reasonable estimate for the threshold cyclic-light intensity which produces damage to retinas of albino rats raised under 6 lx lies between 65- and 130 lx, or slightly more than 1 log unit above the light intensity under which the animals were raised. the effects of an animal's light history on retinal susceptibility to light damage are discussed.
background: osteoprotegerin (opg) is considered to be the cytokine that plays an important role in the healing process. opg regulates bone cell biology, osteoblast–osteoclast, bone-immune cross-talk and maintenance of bone mass. it plays an important role in the development, induction, and repair of bone. orthognathic surgery as multiples segmental osteotomies has been taken as a model surgery to assess the changes in osteoprotegerin levels in the post-operative bone healing period. aim: the aim of the study was to evaluate opg as immunological caliper of bone healing. material and methods: opg was evaluated in nine patients seeking orthognathic surgery. patients were examined and checked to be medically and immunologically free prior to surgery. blood samples were collected immediate pre-operative as control group and for six weeks post-operative as study group. results: data were collected from nine consecutive patients. the results showed higher levels of opg. it showed significant increase in the immediate post-operative value (p = 0.001) which started to increase gradually during the six weeks (p < 0.001). conclusions: significant higher levels of opg during the healing period of orthognathic surgery suggest the its use as immunological caliper of bone healing. fracture healing is an ordered process that restores the structural integrity of the bone. soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor-kb (srank), its ligand (srankl) and osteoprotegerin (opg) are involved in bone remodelling, thus they may play a role in fracture repair. opg, soluble rank and rankl levels were measured in plasma and in drainage fluid, collected from pre-surgery phase to healing in ten patients of both genders (age range 26–65 years) with proximal humerus fracture needing osteosynthesis. all patients showed fracture healing. no significant modifications in the concentrations of srankl and opg were observed, while srank showed a significant increase in drainage fluid 24 hours post-surgery compared with intra-surgery time. opg levels were higher in plasma and drainage fluid than srank and srankl at each time point. since there are no published data about srank involvement in fracture healing, our study represents the first preliminary indication about a local increase of this marker concentration immediately after surgery.
chronic kidney disease (ckd) is a worldwide public health threat that increases risk of death due to cardiovascular complications, including left ventricular hypertrophy (lvh). novel therapeutic targets are needed to design treatments to alleviate the cardiovascular burden of ckd. previously, we demonstrated that circulating concentrations of fibroblast growth factor (fgf) 23 rise progressively in ckd and induce lvh through an unknown fgf receptor (fgfr)-dependent mechanism. here, we report that fgf23 exclusively activates fgfr4 on cardiac myocytes to stimulate phospholipase cγ/calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated t cell signaling. a specific fgfr4-blocking antibody inhibits fgf23-induced hypertrophy of isolated cardiac myocytes and attenuates lvh in rats with ckd. mice lacking fgfr4 do not develop lvh in response to elevated fgf23, whereas knockin mice carrying an fgfr4 gain-of-function mutation spontaneously develop lvh. thus, fgf23 promotes lvh by activating fgfr4, thereby establishing fgfr4 as a pharmacological target for reducing cardiovascular risk in ckd. chronic kidney disease (ckd) is a public health epidemic that increases risk of death due to cardiovascular disease. left ventricular hypertrophy (lvh) is an important mechanism of cardiovascular disease in individuals with ckd. elevated levels of fgf23 have been linked to greater risks of lvh and mortality in patients with ckd, but whether these risks represent causal effects of fgf23 is unknown. here, we report that elevated fgf23 levels are independently associated with lvh in a large, racially diverse ckd cohort. fgf23 caused pathological hypertrophy of isolated rat cardiomyocytes via fgf receptor-dependent activation of the calcineurin-nfat signaling pathway, but this effect was independent of klotho, the coreceptor for fgf23 in the kidney and parathyroid glands. intramyocardial or intravenous injection of fgf23 in wild-type mice resulted in lvh, and klotho-deficient mice demonstrated elevated fgf23 levels and lvh. in an established animal model of ckd, treatment with an fgf-receptor blocker attenuated lvh, although no change in blood pressure was observed. these results unveil a klotho-independent, causal role for fgf23 in the pathogenesis of lvh and suggest that chronically elevated fgf23 levels contribute directly to high rates of lvh and mortality in individuals with ckd.
purposethis study examined the usefulness of inflammatory markers in the management of patients with right iliac fossa pain.patients and methodsa single site, prospective observational study was conducted from october 2001 to april 2003. patients with right iliac fossa pain referred to the surgeon were included. blood samples were obtained for c-reactive protein, leukocyte, and granulocyte analysis. clinical, surgical, and histopathologic data were collected. analysis of inflammatory parameters was performed with logistic regression and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were compared.resultsc-reactive protein increased with the severity of appendicitis and predicted accurately perforation (r2 = 0.613; p < 0.0005), showing the highest accuracy among inflammatory markers (areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve were 0.846, 0.753, and 0.685 for c-reactive protein, leukocyte and granulocytes, respectively; p < 0.001). accuracy improved when c-reactive protein and leukocytes were combined; positive and negative predictive values were 93.2 percent and 92.3 percent, respectively.conclusionsc-reactive protein is a helpful marker in the management of patients with right iliac fossa pain; the predictive value improves when combined with leukocyte count. a patient with normal c-reactive protein and leukocytes has a very low probability of appendicitis and should not undergo surgery. background studies have shown that c-reactive protein (crp) and total leucocyte count (wbc) in suspected acute appendicitis analysed only on admission gave valuable information to guide the surgeon. the aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of crp and wbc measured repetitively before operation.   methods during a 1-year period 227 patients were studied before emergency appendicectomy. crp and wbc were analysed every 4th h. the upper limits of the reference intervals used were 9.0 x 10(9)/l for wbc and 10 mg/l for crp.   results of the 227 appendicectomized patients, 170 (75%) had acute appendicitis. sixty-six of the patients were tested on two or more occasions every 4th h. forty-six of these patients had appendicitis; repetitive tests showed a continuing rise in crp values but a continuing decrease in wbc. the negative appendicectomy rate among these 66 patients was 30%, which theoretically would have fallen to 19% if patients with normal results had not been subjected to surgery.   conclusions repeated laboratory tests for crp and wbc should be performed in patients with suspected acute appendicitis requested to stay for further observation. if these test results are normal, the surgeon should preferably refrain from operating but consider other differential diagnoses.
publisher summary this chapter describes the genetic influence on normal sleep and its regulatory mechanism, and discusses recent clinical discoveries regarding the role of genetic factors in selected sleep disorders. the first sleep-related genes have been identified in monogenic disorders. most of the sleep disorders have complex phenotypes. using array technologies and performing genome-wide association studies and investigating thousands of patients and controls, common genetic susceptibility factors for sleep phenotypes are identified. genome-wide sequencing with second-generation sequencers allows detecting rare genetic variants with a large effect on the phenotype. to explore the genetics of sleep disorders, epigenetic factors should be also considered that might explain the complexity of phenotypes. sleep-related genes or mutations have been demonstrated in animal models, but, with the help of advanced molecular genetic approaches. sleep genetics will soon expand into a search among human models and lead to pharmacogenomic development for individualized sleep medicine. neurons containing the neuropeptide orexin (hypocretin) are located exclusively in the lateral hypothalamus and send axons to numerous regions throughout the central nervous system, including the major nuclei implicated in sleep regulation. here, we report that, by behavioral and electroencephalographic criteria, orexin knockout mice exhibit a phenotype strikingly similar to human narcolepsy patients, as well as canarc-1 mutant dogs, the only known monogenic model of narcolepsy. moreover, modafinil, an anti-narcoleptic drug with ill-defined mechanisms of action, activates orexin-containing neurons. we propose that orexin regulates sleep/wakefulness states, and that orexin knockout mice are a model of human narcolepsy, a disorder characterized primarily by rapid eye movement (rem) sleep dysregulation.
abstract the dna damage response (ddr) that evolved to repair host cell dna damage also recognizes viral dna entering the nucleus during infections. here, we investigated the modulation of ddr signaling during de novo infection of primary endothelial cells by kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv). phosphorylation of representative ddr-associated proteins, such as ataxia telangiectasia mutated (atm) and h2ax, was induced as early as 30 min (0.5 h) postinfection and persisted during in vitro kshv latency. phosphorylated h2ax (γh2ax) colocalized at 30 min (0.5 h) with the kshv genome entering the nuclei. total h2ax protein levels also increased, and the increase was attributed to a decrease in degradative h2ax lys48-linked polyubiquitination with a concomitant increase in lys63-linked polyubiquitination that was shown to increase protein stability. atm and h2ax phosphorylation and γh2ax nuclear foci were also induced by uv-inactivated kshv, which ceased at later times of infection. inhibition of atm kinase activity by ku-55933 and h2ax knockdown by small interfering rna significantly reduced the expression of the kshv latency-associated nuclear antigen 1 (lana-1; orf73) and lana-1 nuclear puncta. knockdown of h2ax also resulted in a >80% reduction in the nuclear kshv dna copy numbers. similar results were also observed in atm-negative cells, although comparable levels of viral dna entered atm-negative and atm-positive cell nuclei. in contrast, knockdown of chk1 and chk2 did not affect orf73 expression. collectively, these results demonstrate that kshv induces atm and h2ax, a selective arm of the ddr, for the establishment and maintenance of its latency during de novo infection of primary endothelial cells. importance eukaryotic cells mount a dna damage response (ddr) to sense and repair different types of cellular dna damage. in addition, ddr also recognizes exogenous genetic material, such as the viral dna genome entering the nucleus during infections. the present study was undertaken to determine whether de novo kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) infection modulates ddr. our results demonstrate that early during de novo infection of primary endothelial cells, kshv induces a selective arm of ddr signaling, such as the atm kinase and its downstream target, h2ax, which are essential for kshv's latent gene expression and the establishment of latency. these studies suggest that targeting atm and h2ax could serve as an attractive strategy to block the establishment of kshv latent infection and the associated malignancies. abstract the dna damage response (ddr) of host cells is utilized by a number of viruses to establish and propagate their genomes in the infected cells. we examined the expression of the ddr genes during kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) infection of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs). the genes were mostly downregulated, except h2ax, which was upregulated during infection. h2ax is important for gammaherpesvirus infectivity, and its phosphorylation at serine 139 is crucial for maintenance of latency during mouse gamma-herpesvirus 68 (mhv-68) infection. we now also observed phosphorylation of h2ax at serine 139 during kshv infection. h2ax is a histone h2a isoform shown to interact with the latency-associated nuclear antigen (lana) encoded by kshv. here, we show that lana directly interacted with h2ax through domains at both its n and c termini. the phosphorylated form of h2ax (γh2ax) was shown to colocalize with lana. chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip) assays showed that a reduction in h2ax levels resulted in reduced binding of lana with kshv terminal repeats (trs). binding preferences of h2ax and γh2ax along the kshv episome were examined by whole-episome chip analysis. we showed that γh2ax had a higher relative binding activity along the tr regions than that of the long unique region (lur), which highlighted the importance of h2ax phosphorylation during kshv infection. furthermore, knockdown of h2ax resulted in decreased kshv episome copy number. notably, the c terminus of lana contributed to phosphorylation of h2ax. however, phosphorylation was not dependent on the ability of lana to drive kshv-infected cells into s-phase. thus, h2ax contributes to association of lana with the trs, and phosphorylation of h2ax is likely important for its increased density at the trs.
objectives many diagnostic studies are aimed at defining "optimal" thresholds. here, we evaluate the performance of empirically defined optimal thresholds (1) in the sample in which they were defined and (2) in the population from which the sample was drawn.   study design and setting we simulated test results for 120,000 samples varying the number of people without a disease (n between 20 and 500), number of people with a disease (m between 20 and 500), the magnitude of the difference between group means [effect size (es) between 0.5 and 4], and distributions (normal and log-normal). the thresholds associated with the maximal youden index were defined as optimal. performance was defined as the percentage of correct classifications in the sample and when applied to the whole population.   results at the population level, the thresholds defined for the four ess (0.5, 0.8, 2, and 4) yielded a median of 59%, 65%, 83%, and 97% correct classifications, respectively. at the sample level, the samples with similar characteristics yielded widely varying estimates of the performance that were systematically higher than at the population level.   conclusion researchers need to be careful defining cut points for mean differences that are traditionally considered "large" (es = 0.8). the diagnostic utility of optimal thresholds needs to be assessed in prospective studies. when investigating the effects of potential prognostic or risk factors that have been measured on a quantitative scale, values of these factors are often categorized into two groups. sometimes an 'optimal' cutpoint is chosen that gives the best separation in terms of a two-sample test statistic. it is well known that this approach leads to a serious inflation of the type i error and to an overestimation of the effect of the prognostic or risk factor in absolute terms. in this paper, we illustrate that the resulting confidence intervals are similarly affected. we show that the application of a shrinkage procedure to correct for bias, together with bootstrap resampling for estimating the variance, yields confidence intervals for the effect of a potential prognostic or risk factor with the desired coverage.
cells can release the free amino acid taurine through volume-regulated anion channels (vracs), and it has been hypothesized that taurine released from glial cells is capable of inhibiting action potential (ap) firing by activating neuronal glycine receptors (glyrs) (hussy et al., 1997). although an inhibitory glyr tone is widely observed in the brain, it remains unknown whether this specifically reflects gliotransmission because most neurons also express vracs and other endogenous molecules can activate glyrs. we found that vracs are absent in neurons of the rat supraoptic nucleus (son), suggesting that glial cells are the exclusive source of taurine in this nucleus. application of strychnine to rat hypothalamic explants caused a depolarization of son neurons associated with a decrease of chloride conductance and could excite these cells in the absence of fast synaptic transmission. this inhibitory glyr tone was eliminated by pharmacological blockade of vracs, by cellular taurine depletion, by metabolic inactivation of glia with fluorocitrate, and after retraction of astrocytic processes that intercalate neuronal somata and dendrites. finally, glyr tone varied inversely with extracellular fluid tonicity to mediate the osmotic control of ap firing by son neurons. these findings establish taurine as a physiological gliotransmitter and show that gliotransmission is a spatially constrained process that can be modulated by the morphological rearrangement of astrocytes. whole cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained from isolated rat supraoptic nucleus magnocellular neurosecretory cells (mncs). under current clamping, hyperosmolality produced by the addition of 10-30 mm mannitol depolarized each of 25 cells tested. in contrast, reducing fluid osmolality from 295 to 265 mosmol/kgh2o had the reverse effect, hyperpolarizing 18 of 21 mncs. voltage-clamp recordings in 43 cells revealed that the effects of hypo- and hyperosmolality, respectively, were caused by decreases and increases in a nonselective cation conductance reversing near -41 mv. current-voltage analysis in na(+)-free solution revealed that the reversal potentials of currents elicited by increases and decreases in osmolality both shifted to a value near -90 mv, suggesting that a single ionic conductance is modulated by these stimuli. the relation between cationic conductance and osmolality was specific, sensitive (+2.14%.mosmol-1.kgh2o-1), and well-fit by linear regression (r = 0.96; n = 22 cells) between 275 and 325 mosmol/kgh2o. these results indicate that mncs express a depolarizing current that is active under steady-state conditions and that the up- or downregulation of this current contributes to the excitation or inhibition of these cells upon acute exposure to hypo- or hyperosmolar conditions.
summarydifferential osteogenic potential and responsiveness to 17β-estradiol (e2) of mesenchymal stem cells (mscs) were found between postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (op) and osteoarthritis (oa). these results suggest differential biological mechanisms of estrogen deficiency in regulation of bone remodeling between op and oa.introductionop and oa are two common disorders in postmenopausal women. the inverse relationship has been suggested between op and oa, but their mechanisms that relate to estrogen deficiency are not fully understood. the aim of this study was to compare the differential responsiveness to e2 of mscs from osteoporotic versus osteoarthritic donors.methodstwenty postmenopausal patients, ten with osteoporotic hip fractures and ten with hip osteoarthritis, were included into this study. mscs were derived from cancellous bones of femoral heads from oa and op donors and cultured in osteogenic and adipogenic medium with or without e2 added. the alkaline phosphatase (alp) activity, calcium content, calcified nodules, lipid droplets, messenger rna (mrna) expression of alp, osteocalcin (oc), collagen 1α (col1α), peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor γ2 (pparγ2) and lipoprotein lipase (lpl) were measured and compared between two groups with op and oa.resultsin osteogenic medium, alp activity, calcium content and mrna expression of oc and col1α in mscs from oa were significantly higher than those from op group. in adipogenic condition, there was no significant difference in lipid droplets formation and mrna expression of pparγ2 and lpl between op and oa groups. with e2 added in osteogenic medium, alp activity, calcium content and oc mrna were significantly higher in op group than in oa group, whereas e2 had no significant effect on lipid droplet formation and mrna expression of pparγ2 and lpl.conclusiondifferential osteogenic potential and responsiveness to e2 of mscs were found between postmenopausal women with op and oa. these results may provide information for clinical application of mscs in the differential setting of estrogen deficiency. the aim of this study was to compare the osteogenic potential and responsiveness to leptin of mesenchymal stem cells (mscs) from bone marrow between postmenopausal women with osteoarthritis (oa) and osteoporosis (op). mscs of the proximal femur from oa and op donors were cultured under control and different experimental mediums. after verifying the availability of primary cells, their osteogenic potential and responsiveness to leptin were compared between two groups. similar patterns of cell growth were shown in both oa and op groups. however, after the sixth passage, the viability of undifferentiated cells decreased more in op than in oa donors. under the same osteogenic supplements condition, the mrna expression of osteogenesis‐specific genes, osteocalcin (oc) and alkaline phosphatase (alp) were higher in oa group. comparison of bone matrix mineralization was parallel to that of mrna expression. the level of bone‐specific alp (bap) was higher in cells from donors with oa, whereas osteoprotegerin (opg) was higher in op group. this difference in bap expression proved to be insignificant after the administration of leptin. although leptin upregulated the expression of opg, a significant difference still existed between oa and op. in conclusion, differential osteogenic potential and responsiveness to leptin of mscs were noted between postmenopausal women with oa and op. differential biological behavior of mscs seems to be partly related to the different distribution of bone mass between oa and op populations. © 2009 orthopaedic research society. published by wiley periodicals, inc. j orthop res 27: 1067–1073, 2009
backgroundalthough laparoscopic major hepatectomy (lmh) is becoming increasingly common in specialized centers, data regarding laparoscopic extended major hepatectomies (lemh) and their outcomes are limited. the aim of this study was to compare the perioperative characteristics and postoperative outcomes of lemh to standard lmh.methodsall patients who underwent purely laparoscopic anatomical right or left hepatectomy and right or left trisectionectomy between february 1998 and january 2016 are enrolled. demographic, clinicopathological, and perioperative factors were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively. perioperative characteristics and postoperative outcomes in lemh were compared to those of standard lmh.resultsamong 195 patients with lmh, 47 (24.1%) underwent lemh, colorectal liver metastases representing 66.7% of all indications. preoperative portal vein embolization was undertaken in 31 (15.9%) patients. despite more frequent vascular clamping, blood loss was higher in lemh group (400 vs. 214 ml; p = 0.006). however, there was no difference in intraoperative transfusion requirements. thirty-one patients experienced liver failure with no differences between lmh and lemh groups. postoperative mortality was comparable in the two groups [3 (2.5%) lmh patients vs. 2 (5%) lemh patients (p = 0.388)]. overall morbidity was higher in the lemh group [49 lmh patients (41.5%) vs. 24 lemh patients (60%) (p = 0.052)]. patients treated with left lemh experienced more biliary leakage (p = 0.011) and more major pulmonary complications (p = 0.015) than left lmh.conclusionlemh is feasible at the price of important morbidity, with manageable and acceptable outcomes. these exigent procedures require high-volume centers with experienced surgeons. background left hepatic trisectionectomy is the most extended hepatic resection. to date, few data are available on longterm outcomes after this operation.   study design between june 1998 and july 2004, a total of 52 patients underwent left trisectionectomy for primary or secondary hepatobiliary tumors at our institution. data were analyzed with regard to patient characteristics, intraoperative details, pathologic findings, perioperative morbidity and mortality, and outcomes as determined by survival.   results left trisectionectomy was combined with caudate lobectomy and hilar lymph node dissection in 29 and 35 patients, respectively. in addition, 43 procedures were performed in 31 patients: resection of hilar bifurcation (n = 15), bile-duct revision (n = 5), wedge resection of segment vi/vii (n = 10), gastrectomy (n = 1), and resection or reconstruction of hepatic vessels or the inferior vena cava (n = 12). operative morbidity and mortality were 50% and 11.9%, respectively. by multivariate analysis, additional operative procedures constituted the only positive predictor of postoperative morbidity. one-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 65%, 52%, and 33%, respectively. after r0 resection (n = 37), 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 78%, 68%, and 44% compared with 38%, 15%, and 7% after r1 resection (p = 0.0004). survival corresponding to the four most frequent tumor types (hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocellular carcinoma, hilar cholangiocarcinoma, and colorectal metastases) was comparable with survival data reported in the literature after less-extensive resections.   conclusions left trisectionectomy provides acceptable survival rates in both locally advanced primary hepatobiliary malignancies and large metastatic liver tumors. despite major progress in surgical technique and perioperative management, left trisectionectomy is still associated with higher operative mortality and morbidity than less-extensive resections. because selection criteria for this type of procedure are not clearly defined, particular attention should be focused on the oncologic benefits when considering this operation.
escherichia coli o157∶h7 is a mesophilic food-borne pathogen. we investigated the growth kinetics of e. coli o157∶h7 sakai during an abrupt temperature downshift from 35°c to either 20°c, 17°c, 14°c or 10°c; as well as the molecular mechanisms enabling growth after cold stress upon an abrupt downshift from 35°c to 14°c in an integrated transcriptomic and proteomic analysis. all downshifts caused a lag period of growth before growth resumed at a rate typical of the post-shift temperature. lag and generation time increased with the magnitude of the shift or with the final temperature, while relative lag time displayed little variation across the test range. analysis of time-dependent molecular changes revealed, in keeping with a decreased growth rate at lower temperature, repression of genes and proteins involved in dna replication, protein synthesis and carbohydrate catabolism. consistent with cold-induced remodelling of the bacterial cell envelope, alterations occurred in the expression of genes and proteins involved in transport and binding. the rpos regulon exhibited sustained induction confirming its importance in adaptation and growth at 14°c. the rpoe regulon was transiently induced, indicating a potential role for this extracytoplasmic stress response system in the early phase of low temperature adaptation during lag phase. interestingly, genes previously reported to be amongst the most highly up-regulated under oxidative stress were consistently down-regulated. this comprehensive analysis provides insight into the molecular mechanisms operating during adaptation of e. coli to growth at low temperature and is relevant to its physiological state during chilling in foods, such as carcasses. an integrated transcriptomic and proteomic analysis was undertaken to determine the physiological response of escherichia coli o157:h7 sakai to steady-state conditions relevant to low temperature and water activity conditions experienced during meat carcass chilling in cold air. the response of e. coli during exponential growth at 25 °c aw 0.985, 14 °c aw 0.985, 25 °c aw 0.967, and 14 °c aw 0.967 was compared with that of a reference culture (35 °c aw 0.993). gene and protein expression profiles of e. coli were more strongly affected by low water activity (aw 0.967) than by low temperature (14 °c). predefined group enrichment analysis revealed that a universal response of e. coli to all test conditions included activation of the master stress response regulator rpos and the rcs phosphorelay system involved in the biosynthesis of the exopolysaccharide colanic acid, as well as down-regulation of elements involved in chemotaxis and motility. however, colanic acid-deficient mutants were shown to achieve comparable growth rates to their wild-type parents under all conditions, indicating that colanic acid is not required for growth. in contrast to the transcriptomic data, the proteomic data revealed that several processes involved in protein synthesis were down-regulated in overall expression at 14 °c aw 0.985, 25 °c aw 0.967, and 14 °c aw 0.967. this result suggests that during growth under these conditions, e. coli, although able to transcribe the required mrna, may lack the cellular resources required for translation. elucidating the global adaptive response of e. coli o157:h7 during exposure to chilling and water activity stress has provided a baseline of knowledge of the physiology of this pathogen.
background there is an unmet need for practical and reliable biomarkers for mood disorders in young adults. identifying the brain activity associated with the early signs of depressive disorders could have important diagnostic and therapeutic implications. in this study we sought to investigate the eeg characteristics in young adults with newly identified depressive symptoms.   methods based on the initial screening, a total of 100 participants (n = 50 euthymic, n = 50 depressive) underwent 32-channel eeg acquisition. simple logistic regression and c-statistic were used to explore if eeg power could be used to discriminate between the groups. the strongest eeg predictors of mood using multivariate logistic regression models.   results simple logistic regression analysis with subsequent c-statistics revealed that only high-alpha and beta power originating from the left central cortex (c3) have a reliable discriminative value (roc curve >0.7 (70%)) for differentiating the depressive group from the euthymic group. multivariate regression analysis showed that the single most significant predictor of group (depressive vs. euthymic) is the high-alpha power over c3 (p = 0.03).   conclusion the present findings suggest that eeg is a useful tool in the identification of neurophysiological correlates of depressive symptoms in young adults with no previous psychiatric history.   significance our results could guide future studies investigating the early neurophysiological changes and surrogate outcomes in depression. in previous quantitative eeg studies of depression, mostly patients with a lifetime history of depressive disorders were reported. this study examined quantitative eeg parameters obtained in the early stages of depression in comparison with age-matched healthy controls. eeg was recorded using two different montages in eyes closed and eyes open resting states. a significant increase in spectrum power in theta (4–7.5 hz), alpha (7.5–14 hz), and beta (14–20 hz) frequency bands was found in depressed patients at parietal and occipital sites, both in eyes closed and eyes open conditions. these results suggest that an increase in slow (theta and alpha) activity in the eeg pattern may reflect a decreased cortical activation in these brain regions. enhancement of beta power may correlate with anxiety symptoms that most likely play an important role on the onset of depressive disorder.
background in saccharomyces cerevisiae, three out of the four histone gene pairs (hta1-htb1, hht1-hhf1, and hht2-hhf2) are regulated by the hir co-repressor complex. the histone chaperone rtt106 has recently been shown to be present at these histone gene loci throughout the cell cycle in a hir- and asf1-dependent manner and involved in their transcriptional repression. the swi/snf and rsc chromatin remodeling complexes are both recruited to the hir-dependent histone genes; swi/snf is required for their activation in s phase, whereas rsc is implicated in their repression outside of s phase. even though their presence at the histone genes is dependent on the hir complex, their specific recruitment has not been well characterized. in this study we focused on characterizing the role played by the histone chaperone rtt106 in the cell cycle-dependent recruitment of swi/snf and rsc complexes to the histone genes. methodology/principal findings using gst pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we showed that rtt106 physically interacts with both the swi/snf and rsc complexes in vitro and in vivo. we then investigated the function of this interaction with respect to the recruitment of these complexes to hir-dependent histone genes. using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (chip), we found that rtt106 is important for the recruitment of both swi/snf and rsc complexes to the hir-dependent histone genes. furthermore, using synchronized cell cultures, we showed by chip assays that the rtt106-dependent swi/snf recruitment to these histone gene loci is cell cycle regulated and restricted to late g1 phase just before the peak of histone gene expression in s phase. conclusions/significance overall, these data strongly suggest that the interaction between the histone chaperone rtt106 and both the swi/snf and rsc chromatin remodeling complexes is important for the cell cycle regulated recruitment of these two complexes to the hir-dependent histone genes. genetic and biochemical studies indicate that the evolutionarily conserved swi/snf complex acts at a subset of genes to help transcriptional activators function on chromatin templates. the mechanism by which this complex is targeted to specific chromosomal loci remains unknown. we show that swi/snf is required for expression of the yeast histone hta1-htb1 locus because of the role of hir1p and hir2p corepressors in negatively regulating transcription. snf5p, snf2p/swi2p, and swi3p, three components of the yeast swi/snf complex, coimmunoprecipitate with each hir protein, and snf5p is maximally associated with the hta1-htb1 promoter when the hir-based repression system is intact and the swi/snf complex is functional. the data support a role for the hir repressors in the gene-specific targeting of swi/snf.
developmental gene amplification in the ovarian follicle cells of drosophila provides a powerful system for the study of metazoan dna replication. amplification produces 100kb gradients of amplified dna through repeated rounds of origin firing and bidirectional movement of replication forks from these origins. the drosophila follicle cell amplicon at the cytological location 62d, dafc-62d, is uniquely regulated, with two separate rounds of amplification in developmental stages 10 and 13 of egg chamber development. we investigated mechanisms that control the unusual timing of dafc-62d origin activation. we first defined origin sequences in dafc-62d by analyzing the amount of nascent replicative dna across this amplicon. surprisingly, the origin coincides with the coding region of a gene named yellow-g2. orc2 localizes to the origin, as well as two other sites that do not confer origin activity. both orc2 and mcm2-7 display differential association with these sequences, corresponding to the two rounds of amplification. all three elements, dispersed in a 7kb central amplified region, are required for either round of dafc-62d amplification, because deleting any one completely abolished amplification in transposon experiments. preceded by transcription yellow-g2 in stage 12, the late round of origin firing was ablated by the rnapii inhibitor α-amanitin. this effect was absent from other amplicons and insulated transposons, and was stage-13 specific for amplification at either the endogenous dafc-62d or heterologous transposons that did not have functional insulators. therefore amplification at dafc-62d in late follicle cell differentiation depends on transcription in cis. molecularly, blocking rnapii transcription compromises mcm2-7 recruitment. additional transposon and histone modification analyses confirmed the involvement of rnapii in amplification control, which may be facilitated by favorable chromatin structure. this work provides insights in developmental regulation of origin firing, revealing one mechanism for initiation of metazoan dna replication: recruitment of mcm2-7 by rna polymerase ii transcription. a cluster of drosophila melanogaster chorion genes at locus 66d on the third chromosome amplifies 60-fold in the ovarian follicle cells prior to the onset of gene expression. a 3.8-kilobase (kb) region of the gene cluster can induce tissue-specific amplification in transformants. previous models postulated that amplification is activated in follicle cells by transcription of one of the two chorion genes (s15 and s18) located within the 3.8-kb essential region. in this study, we showed that neither s15 nor s18 chorion gene transcription was required for amplification. however, a 510-bp region upstream from s18 contained sequences essential for both amplification and s18 transcription. no other region within the 3.8-kb fragment was required for amplification. we propose that upstream transcription control elements rather than transcription per se are involved in controlling amplification during development.
backgrounddespite long-lasting hiv replication control, a significant proportion of elite controller (ec) patients may experience cd4 t-cell loss. discovering perturbations in immunological parameters could help our understanding of the mechanisms that may be operating in those patients experiencing loss of immunological control.methodsa case–control study was performed to evaluate if alterations in different t-cell homeostatic parameters can predict cd4 t-cell loss in ecs by comparing data from ec patients showing significant cd4 decline (cases) and ec patients showing stable cd4 counts (controls). the partial least-squares–class modeling (pls-cm) statistical methodology was employed to discriminate between the two groups of patients, and as a predictive model.resultsherein, we show that among t-cell homeostatic alterations, lower levels of naïve and recent thymic emigrant subsets of cd8 cells and higher levels of effector and senescent subsets of cd8 cells as well as higher levels of exhaustion of cd4 cells, measured prior to cd4 t-cell loss, predict the loss of immunological control.conclusionsthese data indicate that the parameters of t-cell homeostasis may identify those ec patients with a higher proclivity to cd4 t-cell loss. our results may open new avenues for understanding the mechanisms underlying immunological progression despite hiv replication control, and eventually, for finding a functional cure through immune-based clinical trials. background human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) elite controllers are able to control virus replication to levels below the limits of detection by commercial assays, but the actual level of viremia in these individuals is not well defined. here, we quantify plasma hiv-1 rna in elite controllers and correlate this with specific immunologic parameters.   methods plasma hiv-1 rna levels were quantified in 90 elite controllers with use of a real time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay with a sensitivity of 0.2 copies/ml. hiv-1-specific immune responses and longitudinal cd4(+) t cell counts were examined.   results the median plasma hiv-1 rna level was 2 copies/ml (interquartile range, 0.2-14 copies/ml). a longitudinal analysis of 31 elite controllers demonstrated 2-5-fold fluctuations in viremia in the majority of individuals; 6 had persistent levels below 1 copy/ml. viremia correlated directly with hiv-1-specific neutralizing antibodies and western blot reactivity but not with cd8(+) t cell responses. absolute cd4(+) t cell decrease was more common among individuals with detectable viremia (p = .04).   conclusions low-level viremia is present in the majority of elite controllers and is associated with higher hiv-1-specific antibody responses. absolute cd4(+) t cell loss is more common among viremic individuals, suggesting that even very low-level viremia has negative consequences over time.
the present experiment examined the effects of varying stimulus disparity and relative punisher frequencies on signal detection by humans. participants were placed into one of two groups. group 3 participants were presented with 1:3 and 3:1 punisher frequency ratios, while group 11 participants were presented with 1:11 and 11:1 punisher frequency ratios. for both groups, stimulus disparity was varied across three levels (low, medium, high) for each punisher ratio. in all conditions, correct responses were intermittently reinforced (1:1 reinforcer frequency ratio). participants were mostly biased away from the more punished alternative, with more extreme response biases found for group 11 participants compared to group 3. for both groups, estimates of discriminability increased systematically across the three disparity levels and were unaffected by the punisher ratios. likewise, estimates of response bias and sensitivity to the punisher ratios were unaffected by changes in discriminability, supporting the assumption of parameter invariance in the davison and tustin (1978) model of signal detection. overall, the present experiment found no relation between stimulus control and punisher control, and provided further evidence for similar but opposite effects of punishers to reinforcers in signal-detection procedures. three experiments using human participants varied the distribution of point-gain reinforcers or point-loss punishers in two-alternative signal-detection procedures. experiment 1 varied the distribution of point-gain reinforcers for correct responses (group a) and point-loss punishers for errors (group b) across conditions. response bias varied systematically as a function of the relative reinforcer or punisher frequencies. experiment 2 arranged two conditions - one where an unequal ratio of reinforcement (5ratio1 or 1ratio5) was presented without punishment (r-only), and another where the same reinforcer ratio was presented with an equal distribution of point-loss punishers (r+p). response bias was significantly greater in the r-only condition than the r+p condition, supporting a subtractive model of punishment. experiment 3 varied the distribution of point-gain reinforcers for correct responses across four unequal reinforcer ratios (5ratio1, 2ratio1, 1ratio2, 1ratio5) both without (r-only) and with (r+p) an equal distribution of point-loss punishers for errors. response bias varied systematically with changes in relative reinforcer frequency for both r-only and r+p conditions, with 5 out of 8 participants showing increases in sensitivity estimates from r-only to r+p conditions. overall, the results indicated that punishers have similar but opposite effects to reinforcers in detection procedures and that combined reinforcer and punisher effects might be better modeled by a subtractive punishment model than an additive punishment model, consistent with research using concurrent-schedule choice procedures.
mangrove forests are highly productive ecosystems but represent low nutrient environments. nitrogen availability is one of the main factors limiting mangrove growth. diazotrophs have been identified as key organisms that provide nitrogen to these environments. n2-fixation by such organisms was found to be higher in the mangrove roots than in surrounding rhizosphere. moreover, previous studies showed that mangroves grew better in the presence of n2-fixers indicating a potentially mutualistic relationship. however, the molecular signals and mechanisms that govern these interactions are still poorly understood. here we present novel insights in the interaction of a diazotroph with a mangrove species to improve our understanding of the molecular and ecophysiological relationship between these two organisms under controlled conditions. our results showed that marinobacterium mangrovicola is a versatile organism capable of competing with other organisms to survive for long periods in mangrove soils. n2-fixation by this bacterium was up-regulated in the presence of mangrove roots, indicating a possible beneficial interaction. the increase in n2-fixation was limited to cells of the exponential growth phase suggesting that n2-fixation differs over the bacterial growth cycle. bacterial transformants harboring a transcriptional nifh::gusa fusion showed that m. mangrovicola successfully colonized mangrove roots and simultaneously conducted n2-fixation. the colonization process was stimulated by the lack of an external carbon source suggesting a possible mutualistic relationship. m. mangrovicola represents an interesting genetically accessible diazotroph, which colonize mangrove roots and exhibit higher n2-fixation in the presence of mangrove roots. consequently, we propose this microorganism as a tool to study molecular interactions between n2-fixers and mangrove plants and to better understand how changes in the environment could impact these important and relatively unknown interactions. trichodesmium spp. have proved to be enigmatic organisms, and their ecology and physiology are unusual among diazotrophs. recent research shows that they can simultaneously fix n2 and take up combined nitrogen. the co-occurrence of these two processes is thought to be incompatible, but they could be obligatory in trichodesmium spp. if only a small fraction of cells within a colony or along a filament are capable of n2 fixation. combined nitrogen is released from cells during periods of active growth and n2 fixation, and concomitantly taken up by trichodesmium spp. or cells living in association with colonies. although the nitrogenase of trichodesmium spp. is affected by high concentrations of combined nitrogen, it might be relatively less sensitive to low concentrations of combined nitrogen typical of the oligotrophic ocean and culture conditions. nitrogenase activity and synthesis exhibits an endogenous rhythm in trichodesmium spp. cultures, which is affected by the addition of nitrogen.
