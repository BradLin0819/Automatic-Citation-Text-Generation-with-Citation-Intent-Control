recent epidemiological studies show that obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd) and its comorbidity with psychiatric problems is more prevalent among children and adolescents than was previously believed. the primary aim of the current study is to investigate the point-prevalence rate of obsessive compulsive symptoms in a sample of adolescent high school student in iran. a two-stage epidemiological study was carried out through a clustered random sampling method. all participants went through a two-stage assessment procedure, in the first screening phase, the maudsley obsessive-compulsive inventory (moci) was administered to 909 randomly selected students (in the age range 14-18 years). participants were considered possible sub-clinical or clinical ocd cases, if they obtained a score of moci≥15. in the second stage, the symptoms checklist -90-revised (scl-90-r) was administered to student who fulfilled the screening criteria. the prevalence of oc symptoms was found to be 11.2 percent for the total sample. the most prevalent comorbid conditions were depression and anxiety with prevalence rates of 91.2 and 78.4 percent respectively. gender, age, birth-order, parent's education and family income had no statistically significant association with oc symptoms. further research in this area is warranted in order to establish a set of comprehensive global assessment and measurement tools, which would allow cross-cultural studies in the field of ocd. we conducted a household survey of 3,012 adults aged 18 and over in order to estimate the prevalence of dsm-iv obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd) in urban areas in konya, turkey. trained psychiatry interns administered the 2.1 version of the ocd section of the composite international diagnostic interview (cidi). the 12-month period prevalence rate of ocd was 3.0%. the mean age of onset of ocd was 25.9 +/- 12.5 (range, 7 to 63) years. the prevalence rate of ocd was slightly higher among females (males 2.5%, females 3.3%), but the difference was not statistically significant. the relative risk for divorced, separated, or widowed subjects was approximately 4.2 times higher for ocd than others (2.7% v 10.5%). the 1-year prevalence of ocd inversely related to age group in male subjects, but increased with age in female subjects. the prevalence rate of ocd was not different by the level of education, except it was statistically higher among subjects who were literate but had no schooling, of which the causal relationship was high prevalence rate of ocd among female literate-but no schooling subjects. subjects with few (one or two) and more siblings (seven or more) had a significantly higher prevalence rate of ocd than subjects with moderate numbers of siblings (three to six). no significant difference was found according to employment, fertility, birth order, and income of the subjects. about 30% of subjects with ocd had only obsessions, whereas 68.5% had both obsessions and compulsions. only one subject (1.1%) with ocd met compulsion criteria without obsessions. the prevalence rate of ocd we found in konya, turkey was similar to the prevalence rates of most epidemiological studies.
ketamine, an n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor ion channel blocker, is a widely used anesthetic recently reported to enhance neuronal death in developing rodents and nonhuman primates. this study evaluated dose-response and time-course effects of ketamine, levels of ketamine in plasma and brain, and the relationship between altered nmda receptor expression and ketamine-induced neuronal cell death during development. postnatal day 7 rats were administered 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg ketamine using single or multiple injections (subcutaneously) at 2-h intervals, and the potential neurotoxic effects were examined 6 h after the last injection. no significant neurotoxic effects were detected in layers ii or iii of the frontal cortex of rats administered one, three, or six injections of 5 or 10 mg/kg ketamine. however, in rats administered six injections of 20 mg/kg ketamine, a significant increase in the number of caspase-3- and fluoro-jade c-positive neuronal cells was observed in the frontal cortex. electron microscopic observations showed typical nuclear condensation and fragmentation indicating enhanced apoptotic characteristics. increased cell death was also apparent in other brain regions. in addition, apoptosis occurred after plasma and brain levels of ketamine had returned to baseline levels. in situ hybridization also showed a remarkable increase in mrna signals for the nmda nr1 subunit in the frontal cortex. these data demonstrate that ketamine administration results in a dose-related and exposure-time dependent increase in neuronal cell death during development. ketamine-induced cell death appears to be apoptotic in nature and closely associated with enhanced nmda receptor subunit mrna expression. physiological cell death (pcd), a process by which redundant or unsuccessful neurons are deleted by apoptosis (cell suicide) from the developing central nervous system, has been recognized as a natural phenomenon for many years. whether environmental factors can interact with pcd mechanisms to increase the number of neurons undergoing pcd, thereby converting this natural phenomenon into a pathological process, is an interesting question for which new answers are just now becoming available. in a series of recent studies we have shown that 2 major classes of drugs (those that block nmda glutamate receptors and those that promote gabaa receptor activation), when administered to immature rodents during the period of synaptogenesis, trigger widespread apoptotic neurodegeneration throughout the developing brain. in addition, we have found that ethanol, which has both nmda antagonist and gabamimetic properties, triggers a robust pattern of apoptotic neurodegeneration, thereby deleting large numbers of neurons from many different regions of the developing brain. these findings provide a more likely explanation than has heretofore been available for the reduced brain mass and lifelong neurobehavioral disturbances associated with the human fetal alcohol syndrome (fas). the period of synaptogenesis, also known as the brain growth spurt period, occurs in different species at different times relative to birth. in rats and mice it is a postnatal event, but in humans it extends from the sixth month of gestation to several years after birth. thus, there is a period in pre‐ and postnatal human development, lasting for several years, during which immature cns neurons are prone to commit suicide if exposed to intoxicating concentrations of drugs with nmda antagonist or gabamimetic properties. these findings are important, not only because of their relevance to the fas, but because there are many agents in the human environment, other than ethanol, that have nmda antagonist or gabamimetic properties. such agents include drugs that may be abused by pregnant mothers (ethanol, phencyclidine [angel dust], ketamine [special k], nitrous oxide [laughing gas], barbiturates, benzodiazepines), and many medicinals used in obstetric and pediatric neurology (anticonvulsants), and anesthesiology (all general anesthetics are either nmda antagonists or gabamimetics).
ethylene has myriad roles as a plant hormone, ranging from senescence and defending against pathogen attacks to fruit ripening and interactions with other hormones. it has been shown to increase cambial activity in poplar, but the effect on wood formation in arabidopsis hypocotyl has not previously been studied. the auxin-regulated gene involved in organ size (argos), which increases organ size by lengthening the time for cell division, was found to be upregulated by ethylene. we tested the effect of ethylene treatment at 10 and 100 µm acc on three genotypes of arabidopsis, col0 (wild-type), an argos deficient mutant (argos), and ein3-1, an ethylene insensitive mutant. argos expression analysis with qpcr indicated that acc does induce argos and argos-like (arl) in the hypocotyl. as seen in poplar, ethylene also decreases stem elongation.histochemical staining, showed that ethylene changes the way secondary xylem lignifies, causing gaps in lignification around the outer edge of secondary xylem. our results also implied that ethylene treatment changes the proportion of secondary to total xylem, resulting in less secondary, whereas in poplar, ethylene treatment caused an increase. the plant hormone ethylene is an important signal in plant growth responses to environmental cues. in vegetative growth, ethylene is generally considered as a regulator of cell expansion, but a role in the control of meristem growth has also been suggested based on pharmacological experiments and ethylene-overproducing mutants. in this study, we used transgenic ethylene-insensitive and ethylene-overproducing hybrid aspen (populus tremula × tremuloides) in combination with experiments using an ethylene perception inhibitor [1-methylcyclopropene (1-mcp)] to demonstrate that endogenous ethylene produced in response to leaning stimulates cell division in the cambial meristem. this ethylene-controlled growth gives rise to the eccentricity of populus stems that is formed in association with tension wood.
purposebreast cancer is the most common malignancy among women in mexico. a large proportion of mexican patients present with advanced disease, and 25% have her2-positive tumors. we performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of different sequencing strategies of her2-targeted agents in mexico according to various payer perspectives.methodsa markov model was constructed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of four different her2-targeted treatment sequences among patients with her2-positive metastatic breast cancer treated in mexico according to three public and one private payer perspectives. patients were followed weekly over their remaining life expectancies within the model. health states considered were progression-free survival (pfs) 1st–3rd lines, and death. transition probabilities between states were based on published trials. cost data were obtained from official publications from mexican healthcare institutions. the evaluated outcomes were pfs, os, costs, qalys, and incremental cost effectiveness ratio (icer).resultsin the public payer perspective, sequences containing pertuzumab or t-dm1 were not cost-effective when compared with a sequence including the combination of trastuzumab/docetaxel as first line without subsequent t-dm1 or pertuzumab, even when utilizing alternate definitions for willingness to pay thresholds. in the private payer perspective, a sequence containing t-dm1 but not pertuzumab proved cost-effective at a lower clinical effectiveness.conclusionsin mexico, the use of at least three lines of trastuzumab in combination with other therapies, but not with pertuzumab or tdm-1, represents the most cost-effective option for patients covered by the public healthcare system, and this sequence should be made available for all patients. abstractpurpose based on available phase iii trial data, we performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of different treatment strategies that can be used in patients with newly diagnosed her2-positive metastatic breast cancer (mbc).patients and methodswe constructed a markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of four different her2 targeted treatment sequences in patients with her2-positive mbc treated in the u.s. the model followed patients weekly over their remaining life expectancies. health states considered were progression-free survival (pfs) 1st to 3rd lines, and death. transitional probabilities were based on published phase iii trials. cost data (2015 us dollars) were captured from the u.s. centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) drug payment table and physician fee schedule. health utility data were extracted from published studies. the outcomes considered were pfs, os, costs, qalys, the incremental cost per qaly gained ratio, and the net monetary benefit. deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses assessed the uncertainty around key model parameters and their joint impact on the base-case results.resultsthe combination of trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and docetaxel (thp) as first-line therapy, trastuzumab emtansine (t-dm1) as second-line therapy, and lapatinib/capecitabine third-line resulted in 1.81 qalys, at a cost of $335,231.35. the combination of trastuzumab/docetaxel as first line without subsequent t-dm1 or pertuzumab yielded 1.41 qalys, at a cost of $175,240.69. the least clinically effective sequence (1.27 qalys), but most cost-effective at a total cost of $149,250.19, was trastuzumab/docetaxel as first-line therapy, t-dm1 as second-line therapy, and trastuzumab/lapatinib as third-line therapy.conclusionour results suggest that thp as first-line therapy, followed by t-dm1 as second-line therapy, would require at least a 50 % reduction in the total drug acquisition cost for it to be considered a cost-effective strategy.
backgroundthe prognoses of young breast cancer patients are poor. the purpose of this study is to evaluate the different characteristics and prognoses among different subtypes of young breast cancer patients.methodsthe study included 1360 patients <40 years-old (y) and 3110 patients 40-50y with operable breast cancer in shanghai cancer center, fudan university. the characteristics, overall survival (os) and disease-free survival (dfs) were compared.resultsthe median follow-up was 54.1 months. more grade iii tumors and more lymph-vascular invasions (p < 0.01) were presented in <40y group when compared with 40-50y group. more patients <40y presented with luminal b (25.3% vs. 17.5%, p < 0.01) and triple negative (16.7% vs. 13.4%, p < 0.05) breast cancer while fewer had luminal a tumor (48.5% vs. 59.2%, p < 0.01). younger patients with tumors of both luminal a and luminal b types were at increased risk for worse dfs (p = 0.03, hr = 1.69, 95% ci = 1.05-2.72; p < 0.01, hr = 3.61, 95% ci = 2.50-5.22) when compared with the older patients. patients <40y with luminal b tumor had a two point five fold higher risk of death compared with older counterparts (p < 0.01, hr = 2.54, 95% ci = 1.35-4.79), however, a worse overall survival rate was not observed in the younger women with luminal a breast cancer (p > 0.05). in multivariate analysis, luminal b subtype was also a strong predictor of disease relapse (hr = 1.09, 95% ci = 1.01 to 1.19, p < 0.01) in younger patients with luminal subtype tumors.conclusioncharacteristics of breast cancer suggested a more aggressive biology in chinese patients with breast cancer diagnosed at young age. luminal b subtype may have a negative effect on the prognosis of young patients in china which should be validated further. background breast cancer rarely occurs in young women. our knowledge about disease presentation, prognosis and treatment effects are largely dependent upon older series.   materials and methods we evaluated biological features and stage at presentation for 1427 consecutive premenopausal patients aged < or = 50 years with first diagnosis of invasive breast cancer referred to surgery at the european institute of oncology from april 1997 to august 2000. a total of 185 patients (13%) were aged < 35 years ('very young') and 1242 (87%) were aged 35-50 years ('less young'). the expression of estrogen receptors (er), progesterone receptors (pgr), presence of vascular invasion (vi), grading (g), expression of ki-67, her2/neu overexpression, pathological stage according to tnm staging system (ptnm), pathological tumor size and number of axillary lymph node involvement were evaluated.   results compared with less young patients, the very young patient group had a higher percentage of tumors classified as er negative (p < 0.001), pgr negative (p = 0.001), higher expression of ki-67 > or = 20% of cells stained; 62.2% versus 53%, (p < 0.001), vascular or lymphatic invasion (48.6% versus 37.3%, p = 0.006), and pathological grade 3 (p < 0.0001). there was no difference between the two groups for pt, pathological tumor size (pn) and number of positive lymph nodes.   conclusions we conclude that compared with less young premenopausal patients, very young women have a greater chance of having an endocrine-unresponsive tumor, and are more likely to present with a higher grade, more extensively proliferating and vessel invading disease. pathological tumor size, nodal status and number of positive axillary lymph-nodes have a similar distribution among the younger and the older cohorts, thus not supporting previous data indicating more advanced disease in younger patients at diagnosis of operable disease.
due to hydrophobic and persistent properties, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) have a high capacity to accumulate in sediment. sediment quality criteria, for the assessment of habitat quality and risk for aquatic life, include understanding the fate and effects of pahs. in the context of european regulation (reach and water framework directive), the first objective was to assess the influence of sediment composition on the toxicity of two model pahs, benzo[a]pyrene and fluoranthene using 10-day zebrafish embryo-larval assay. this procedure was undertaken with an artificial sediment in order to limit natural sediment variability. a suitable sediment composition might be then validated for zebrafish and proposed in a new oecd guideline for chemicals testing. second, a comparative study of toxicity responses from this exposure protocol was then performed using another oecd species, the japanese medaka. the potential toxicity of both pahs was assessed through lethal (e.g., survival, hatching success) and sublethal endpoints (e.g., abnormalities, pmr, and erod) measured at different developmental stages, adapted to the embryonic development time of both species. regarding effects observed for both species, a suitable artificial sediment composition for pah toxicity testing was set at 92.5 % dry weight (dw) silica of 0.2–0.5-mm grain size, 5 % dw kaolin clay without organic matter for zebrafish, and 2.5 % dw blond peat in more only for japanese medaka. pah bioavailability and toxicity were highly dependent on the fraction of organic matter in sediment and of the kow coefficients of the tested compounds. the biological responses observed were also dependent of the species under consideration. japanese medaka embryos appeared more robust than zebrafish embryos for understanding the toxicity of pahs following a sediment contact test, due to the longer exposure duration and lower sensitivity of sediment physical properties. neuroactive small molecules are indispensable tools for treating mental illnesses and dissecting nervous system function. however, it has been difficult to discover novel neuroactive drugs. here, we describe a high—throughput (ht) behavior—based approach to neuroactive small molecule discovery in the zebrafish. we use automated screening assays to evaluate thousands of chemical compounds and find that diverse classes of neuroactive molecules cause distinct patterns of behavior. these `behavioral barcodes' can be used to rapidly identify novel psychotropic chemicals and to predict their molecular targets. for example, we identify novel acetylcholinesterase and monoamine oxidase inhibitors using phenotypic comparisons and computational techniques. by combining ht screening technologies with behavioral phenotyping in vivo, behavior—based chemical screens may accelerate the pace of neuroactive drug discovery and provide small—molecule tools for understanding vertebrate behavior.
human eye morphology is considered unique among the primates in that humans possess larger width/height ratios (whr), expose a greater amount of visible sclera (ssi; width of exposed eyeball/width of visible iris), and critically, have a white sclera due to a lack of pigmentation. white sclera in humans amplifies gaze direction, whereas the all‐dark eyes of apes are hypothesized to conceal gaze from others. this study examines whr and ssi in humans (n = 13) and gorillas (n = 85) engaged in direct and averted gazes and introduces a qualitative assessment of sclera color to evaluate variations in sclera pigmentation. the results confirm previous findings that humans possess a larger whr than gorillas but indicate that humans and gorillas display similar amounts of visible sclera. additionally, 72% (n = 124) of gorilla eyes in this sample deviated from the assumed all‐dark eye condition. this questions whether gaze camouflage is the primary function of darkened sclera in non‐human primates or whether other functional roles can be ascribed to the sclera, light or dark. we argue that white sclera evolved to amplify direct gazes in humans, which would have played a significant role in the development of ostensive communication, which is communication that both shows something and shows the intention to show something. we conclude that the horizontal elongation of the human eye, rather than sclera color, more reliably distinguishes human from great ape eyes, represented here by gorillas. am. j. primatol. 77:869–877, 2015. © 2015 wiley periodicals, inc. making eye contact is the most powerful mode of establishing a communicative link between humans. during their first year of life, infants learn rapidly that the looking behaviors of others conveys significant information. two experiments were carried out to demonstrate special sensitivity to direct eye contact from birth. the first experiment tested the ability of 2- to 5-day-old newborns to discriminate between direct and averted gaze. in the second experiment, we measured 4-month-old infants' brain electric activity to assess neural processing of faces when accompanied by direct (as opposed to averted) eye gaze. the results show that, from birth, human infants prefer to look at faces that engage them in mutual gaze and that, from an early age, healthy babies show enhanced neural processing of direct gaze. the exceptionally early sensitivity to mutual gaze demonstrated in these studies is arguably the major foundation for the later development of social skills.
pretreatment serum levels of neurone specific enolase (nse) were measured in patients with small cell lung cancer (sclc). median values were significantly higher in patients with extensive compared with limited stage disease (48 ng ml-1 v. 17 ng ml-1: p less than 0.001). serial nse levels paralleled the clinical response to treatment. in 37 patients with limited sclc, receiving identical chemotherapy, the pretreatment nse level was of prognostic significance: with an approximate reduction in median survival of 10% for each 5 ng ml-1 incremental rise in nse (p = 0.004). among lung cancers small cell carcinoma is the most sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation. this has emphasised the importance of an accurate diagnosis of this cell type, and the present study examined the use of serum neurone specific enolase (nse) as a diagnostic marker for small cell carcinoma. nse was measured in pretreatment sera from 103 patients with small cell carcinoma and in sera from relevant controls, including patients with other lung cancers, non-malignant lung diseases, and healthy adults. serum nse concentration was raised (greater than 25 ng/ml) in 72% of patients with small cell carcinoma. ninety one per cent of patients with extensive disease and 50% of patients with limited disease were serum nse positive. patients with extensive disease in general had higher serum nse concentrations than patients with limited disease. no definite difference in serum nse positivity could be shown between oat cell and intermediate cell subtypes. out of 51 patients with other lung cancers, four (8%) had a raised serum concentration, whereas all patients with non-malignant diseases and healthy individuals had normal serum nse concentrations. serum nse determination seems to be a valuable tool for the diagnosis of small cell carcinoma.
trastuzumab (t) is effective in metastatic breast cancer (mbc) with her2 overexpression and/or amplification, but resistance to t develops in a significant number of her2-positive patients. understanding the mechanisms of resistance is critical to the care of these patients. formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples were collected from 256 patients with t-treated mbc. clinical information was collected retrospectively from the patients’ medical records. central review of her2 status by fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) and/or immunohistochemistry (ihc) revealed that of the 227 eligible patients only 139 (61%) were truly her2-positive. pten, er, pgr, and ki67 were evaluated by ihc, while pten status was evaluated by fish as well. pik3ca mutations were identified with single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) genotyping. median time to progression (ttp) was 14.4 months for the her2-positive and 10.3 for the her2-negative patients (log-rank, p = 0.22). survival from the initiation of t (survivalt) was 50.4 months for the her2-positive and 35.3 for the her2-negative subgroups (p = 0.006). higher risk of progression was associated with her2-positive status and the presence of pik3ca mutations (p = 0.014). pten loss, as determined by ihc, was associated with lower survivalt in the whole population (p = 0.029) and in the her2-positive population (p = 0.017). pik3ca mutations and/or pten loss status were evaluated together as a single parameter, to estimate the impact of activation of the pi3k/akt molecular pathway, and it was significantly associated with both decreased ttp (p = 0.003 in the total population, p = 0.004 in her2-positive patients) and survival (survivalt, p = 0.011 in total, p = 0.006 in her2-positive). in this trastuzumab-treated breast cancer population, pik3ca activating mutations were associated with shorter ttp and pten loss with decreased survival. the activation of the pi3k/akt pathway from either defect was associated with both ttp and survival, indicating the adverse effect of this pathway’s status on trastuzumab efficacy. background in an attempt to identify markers of resistance to trastuzumab, we evaluated both the profiling of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2)-positive tumor cells measuring the relative levels of egfr, pmapk, pakt and pten and their correlations with clinical outcome in her2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients treated with trastuzumab.   patients and methods tumor tissues for this retrospective analysis were available from 45 out of 76 patients with metastatic breast cancer treated from april 1999 to march 2006 with trastuzumab-based therapy at our institution. evaluations of egfr, pmapk, pakt and pten status by immunohistochemistry (ihc) were carried out on all 45 tissue samples and their correlations with response to trastuzumab, incidence of central nervous system (cns) metastases, time to progression (ttp), overall survival from diagnosis of breast cancer (os1), from diagnosis of metastatic disease (os2) and from the start of trastuzumab (os3) were analyzed.   results we observed that ttp (p = 0.001) and median os2 and os3 were significantly longer in patients responsive to trastuzumab-based regimen compared with nonresponsive patients. egfr, pmapk, pakt and pten status by ihc were not significantly associated with response to trastuzumab, ttp, overall survival (os1, os2, os3) and cns metastases incidence. a trend for shorter os3 was observed for pmapk-positive patients compared with pmapk-negative patients (22.8 versus 31.2 months; p = 0.076). median os1 resulted shorter in 22 pakt-positive patients (69.8 months) compared with 23 pakt-negative patients (108.2 months); p = 0.091. it is likely that high expression of pmapk (pmapk-positive status) or pakt (pakt-positive status) could identify a subgroup of her2-positive tumors with high activity of proliferation and survival pathways and with resistance to trastuzumab.   conclusions in her2-positive metastatic breast cancers, egfr, pmapk, pakt and pten status evaluated by ihc was not significantly associated with response to trastuzumab, ttp, os and cns metastases incidence. however, her2 status determined by ihc and/or fish assays may not be sufficient to predict response to trastuzumab-based therapy.
in the present study we performed an integrated proteomics, interactomics and metabolomics analysis of longissimus dorsi tender and tough meat samples from chianina beef cattle. results were statistically handled as to obtain pearson's correlation coefficients of the results from omics investigation in relation to canonical tenderness-related parameters, including warner bratzler shear force, myofibrillar degradation (at 48 h and 10 days after slaughter), sarcomere length and total collagen content. as a result, we could observe that the tender meat group was characterized by higher levels of glycolytic enzymes, which were over-phosphorylated and produced accumulation of glycolytic intermediates. oxidative stress promoted meat tenderness and elicited heat shock protein responses, which in turn triggered apoptosis-like cascades along with parp fragmentation. phosphorylation was found to be a key process in post mortem muscle conversion to meat, as it was shown not only to modulate glycolytic enzyme activities, but also mediate the stability of structural proteins at the z-disk. on the other hand, phosphorylation of hsps has been supposed to alter their functions through changing their affinity for target interactors. analogies and breed-specific differences are highlighted throughout the text via a direct comparison of the present results against the ones obtained in a parallel study on maremmana longissimus dorsi. it emerges that, while the main cornerstones and the final outcome are maintained, post mortem metabolism in tender and tough meat yielding individuals is subtly modulated via specific higher levels of enzymes and amino acidic residue phosphorylation in a breed-specific fashion, and whether calcium homeostasis dysregulation was a key factor in maremmana, higher early post mortem phosphocreatine levels in the chianina tender group could favor a slower and prolonged glycolytic rate, prolonging the extent of the minimum hanging period necessary to obtain tender meat from this breed by a few days. within a population of charolais young bulls, two extreme groups of longissimus thoracis muscle samples, classified according to warner-bratzler shear force (wbsf) of 55 degrees c grilled meat, were analyzed by 2d-electrophoresis. muscle analyses were performed on 4 bulls of the "tender" group (wbsf=27.7+/-4.8 n) and 4 bulls of the "tough" group (wbsf=41.2+/-6.1 n), at 3 post-mortem times: d0, samples taken within 10 min post-mortem; d5 and d21, samples kept at 4 degrees c under vacuum during 5 and 21 days. proteins of muscle samples were separated in two fractions based on protein solubility in tris buffer: "soluble" and "insoluble". proteins of both fractions were separated by 2d-electrophoresis. evolution of spots during the 3 post-mortem times was analyzed by hierarchical classification (hca). three clusters of proteins presenting similar evolution profiles provided accurate classification of post-mortem times and showed the translocation of some chaperone proteins and glycolytic enzymes from the soluble fraction to the insoluble fraction between d0 and d5. cellular structure dismantlement and proteolysis was observed at d21. effect of group ("tender" vs "tough") on spot intensities was tested by anova. at d0, higher quantity of proteins of the inner and outer membrane of mitochondria was found in the tender group suggesting a more extensive degradation of mitochondria that may be related to the apoptotic process.
we study the complexity of valued constraint satisfaction problems (vcsps) parametrized by a constraint language, a fixed set of cost functions over a finite domain. an instance of the problem is specified by a sum of cost functions from the language and the goal is to minimize the sum. under the unique games conjecture, the approximability of finite-valued vcsps is well understood, see raghavendra [2008]. however, there is no characterization of finite-valued vcsps, let alone general-valued vcsps, that can be solved exactly in polynomial time, thus giving insights from a combinatorial optimization perspective.  we consider the case of languages containing all possible unary cost functions. in the case of languages consisting of only {0,∞}-valued cost functions (i.e., relations), such languages have been called conservative and studied by bulatov [2003, 2011] and recently by barto [2011]. since we study valued languages, we call a language conservative if it contains all finite-valued unary cost functions. the computational complexity of conservative valued languages has been studied by cohen et al. [2006] for languages over boolean domains, by deineko et al. [2008] for {0,1}-valued languages (a.k.a max-csp), and by takhanov [2010a] for {0,∞}-valued languages containing all finite-valued unary cost functions (a.k.a. min-cost-hom).  we prove a schaefer-like dichotomy theorem for conservative valued languages: if all cost functions in the language satisfy a certain condition (specified by a complementary combination of stp and mjn multimorphisms), then any instance can be solved in polynomial time (via a new algorithm developed in this article), otherwise the language is np-hard. this is the first complete complexity classification of general-valued constraint languages over non-boolean domains. it is a common phenomenon that complexity classifications of problems over non-boolean domains are significantly harder than the boolean cases. the polynomial-time algorithm we present for the tractable cases is a generalization of the submodular minimization problem and a result of cohen et al. [2008].  our results generalize previous results by takhanov [2010a] and (a subset of results) by cohen et al. [2006] and deineko et al. [2008]. moreover, our results do not rely on any computer-assisted search as in deineko et al. [2008], and provide a powerful tool for proving hardness of finite-valued and general-valued languages. in the constraint satisfaction problem ($csp$), the aim is to find an assignment of values to a set of variables subject to specified constraints. in the minimum cost homomorphism problem ($minhom$), one is additionally given weights $c_{va}$ for every variable $v$ and value $a$, and the aim is to find an assignment $f$ to the variables that minimizes $\sum_{v} c_{vf(v)}$. let $minhom(\gamma)$ denote the $minhom$ problem parameterized by the set of predicates allowed for constraints. $minhom(\gamma)$ is related to many well-studied combinatorial optimization problems, and concrete applications can be found in, for instance, defence logistics and machine learning. we show that $minhom(\gamma)$ can be studied by using algebraic methods similar to those used for csps. with the aid of algebraic techniques, we classify the computational complexity of $minhom(\gamma)$ for all choices of $\gamma$. our result settles a general dichotomy conjecture previously resolved only for certain classes of directed graphs, [gutin, hell, rafiey, yeo, european j. of combinatorics, 2008].
embryo cryopreservation is a routine procedure in assisted reproductive technologies. although couples have been informed about all potential procedures, some of them face the dilemma of what to do with surplus frozen embryos. the purpose of this qualitative study was to evaluate the attitude of patients toward their surplus cryopreserved embryos. fifty patients who had undergone successful ivf cycles, and had surplus embryos cryopreserved were selected from a clinical database. we could contact twenty two patients agreed to participate in the study and responded the interview. seventeen participants (77.3%) believed that cryostoraged embryos were ‘life’. patients who would discard embryos rather than donate to research expressed their concern about the misuse of embryos. those who would discard rather than donate to other couples considered that donating an embryo would be like giving away a child. seven patients were unsure whether life had begun at this stage of development. although some couples thought of their embryos as little more than biological material, others envisioned them as living entities or ‘virtual’ children. the decisions on whether to donate embryos to another couple, or discard them were coloured by strong values about human life and equated with child abandonment. human embryos can only be stored in the first instance for 3 years in western australia, according to the west australian reproductive technology act. thereafter, an application must be made to the local regulatory body, the reproductive technology council, for an extension. of the 650 batches of embryos frozen between 8 april 1993 and 31 october 1995, 170 (26.2%) batches were still in storage after 2.5 years. a reminding letter was sent at this time to the couples to whom the embryos belonged, i.e. 6 months before the expiry of the initial storage period, asking for clarification of what was to be done with the embryos. a large proportion of patients (64.7%) chose to either extend the storage period or thaw and transfer the embryos. curiously, more batches of embryos were discarded (18.8%) than donated to other couples (5.9%). contact with the patients was lost in a small but significant proportion of cases; more of these had been unsuccessful in their treatment (20.4%) than had achieved a pregnancy (4.3%).
large eddy simulations (les) have been successfully applied to premixed turbulent flames in the flamelet regime. however, comparatively little effort to date has focussed on modelling of premixed flames for les in regimes of combustion in which the small turbulence scales can penetrate the flame, the most important of which is the so-called thin-reaction zones regime. utilizing concepts of fractal geometry and damköhler’s limiting flame-speed scalings, this paper proposes a new flame wrinkling model which is intended to be applicable in such regimes. a priori analysis of direct numerical simulations of turbulent, premixed, methane-air slot-jet flames are used to assess the model as well as three literature models of the flame wrinkling. the models are all implemented in a constant coefficient version and in a dynamic version using an approximate germano identity. we investigated the performance of the models as filter size and downstream distance are varied, and good results are obtained for a range of filter sizes. abstract a consistent formulation of the g -equation approach for les is developed. the unfiltered g equation is valid only at the instantaneous flame front location. hence, in a filtering procedure applied to derive the appropriate les equation, only the instantaneous unfiltered flame surface can be considered. a new filter kernel is provided, which averages along the flame surface. the filter kernel is used to derive the g equation for the filtered flame front location. this equation has two unclosed terms, involving a flame front conditional averaged flow velocity, and a filtered propagation term. a model for the conditional velocity is derived, expressing this quantity in terms of the favre-filtered flow velocity, which is typically known from a flow solver. this model leads to the appearance of a density ratio in the propagation term of the g equation. les of combustion in the thin reaction zones regime is discussed in the les regime diagram. a new line is identified separating the thin reaction zones regime into two parts, where the broadened flame thickness is larger and smaller than the filter size, respectively. a model for the propagation term is provided. this leads to a term including the subfilter turbulent burning velocity and an additional term proportional to the resolved flame front curvature. for the former, an algebraic model is provided from an equation for the subfilter flame front wrinkling. the latter term depends on the inverse of the subfilter damkohler number and disappears in the corrugated flamelets regime.
refractory status epilepticus (rse) is a particular critical condition characterized by seizures that continue despite the use of first- and second-line therapies and by high mortality. to date, only one prospective study investigated clinical features and prognostic factors in rse. in this study, we performed a one-year prospective survey to identify clinical features, outcomes, and variables associated with the development of rse in the adolescent and adult population of modena, northern italy. we observed 83 episodes of se in 83 patients. in 31% of the cases, third-line therapy (anesthetic drug) was needed. among this group, 14% resolved and were classified as rse, while, in 17%, seizures recurred at withdrawal of anesthetics and were classified as super-rse. the development of rse/super-rse was associated with a stuporous/comatose state at presentation and with the absence of a previous history of epilepsy. refractory status epilepticus/super-refractory status epilepticus showed a worse outcome compared with responsive se: 54% versus 21% for 30-day mortality; 19% versus 56% for a return to baseline condition. this prospective study confirms stupor/coma at onset as a relevant clinical factor associated with se refractoriness. we observed a rate of rse comparable with previous reports, with high mortality and morbidity. mortality in the observed rse was higher than in previous studies; this result is probably related to the low rate of a previous epilepsy history in our population that reflects a high incidence of acute symptomatic etiologies, especially the inclusion of patients with postanoxic se who have a bad prognosis per se. this article is part of a special issue entitled "status epilepticus". purpose:  status epilepticus (se) that is resistant to two antiepileptic compounds is defined as refractory status epilepticus (rse). in the few available retrospective studies, estimated rse frequency is between 31% and 43% of patients presenting an se episode; almost all seem to require a coma induction for treatment. we prospectively assessed rse frequency, clinical predictors, and outcome in a tertiary clinical setting.
paulownia witches' broom (pawb) caused by phytoplasma might result in devastating damage to the growth and wood production of paulownia. to study the effect of phytoplasma on dna sequence and to discover the genes related to pawb occurrence, dna polymorphisms and dna methylation levels and patterns in pawb seedlings, the ones treated with various concentration of methyl methane sulfonate (mms) and healthy seedlings were investigated with amplified fragment length polymorphism (aflp) and methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (msap). our results indicated that pawb seedlings recovered a normal morphology, similar to healthy seedlings, after treatment with more than 20 mg·l−1 mms; phytoplasma infection did not change the paulownia genomic dna sequence at aflp level, but changed the global dna methylation levels and patterns; genes related to pawb were discovered through msap and validated using quantitative real-time pcr (qrt-pcr). these results implied that changes of dna methylation levels and patterns were closely related to the morphological changes of seedlings infected with phytoplasmas. recent research has demonstrated that dna methylation plays an integral role in regulating the timing of flowering and in endosperm development. the identification of key genes controlling these processes, the expression of which is altered in plants with low methylation, opens the way to understanding how dna methylation regulates plant development.
the objective of this study is to investigate the prevalence of missing teeth and prosthodontic replacements in a chinese adult population using a hierarchical dental functional classification system. a total of 1,462 dentate subjects over 40 years from shandong province, china were included and categorized in the functional classification system with and without tooth replacements. depending on replacements, subjects could be reclassified (promoted) to categories reflecting higher functionality. “promotions” were considered indicators for prosthodontic effectiveness. homogeneities after dichotomization into functional categories appeared to be moderate to good. in the “≥10 teeth in each jaw” branch, mean number of teeth and posterior occluding pairs were 27.93 ± 2.74 and 7.10 ± 1.94, respectively. in the branch “<10 teeth in each jaw,” these figures were 16.17 ± 5.54 and 1.49 ± 1.45. fixed dental prostheses (fdps) added on average 3.5 artificial teeth; 46% of subjects with fdp promoted to a higher functional level. for removable dental prostheses (rdps), these numbers were 8.5% and 79%, respectively. promotion value per tooth added was significantly higher for fdps. the classification system was able to quantify the effectiveness of teeth replacements. it was shown that rdps were more effective when higher numbers of teeth were replaced, while fdps were more effective per artificial tooth added. purpose to review the influence of prosthodontic and dental implant treatment on patient satisfaction and oral health-related quality of life (ohqol) based on a systematic search of the literature.   materials and methods a systematic literature search was carried out for articles published between 1960 and february 2003. details of the search process and results were reported in part 1 of the study (int j prosthodont2004;17:83-93). the included studies were categorized and evaluated according to their level of evidence, following the guidelines of the agency for health care policy and research. the characteristics and content of the studies were analyzed and tabulated.   results among the 114 included studies, there were 76 publications reaching evidence level iii. the results showed that the effects of compromised oral health are not limited to traditional clinical aspects, but can considerably affect patients in various activities of daily life. twenty-four of the 38 investigations with evidence levels i and ii dealt with implant stabilization of complete mandibular prostheses, comparing implant prostheses to conventional complete dentures. fully edentulous patients experience negative impacts on ohqol from their condition. they benefit significantly from the use of dental implants to support mandibular prostheses. however, support by more than 2 implants does not appear to further significantly increase patient satisfaction and ohqol.   conclusions to date, research in the field of patient-based outcomes has concentrated on dental implant treatment for the edentulous patient. other prosthetic treatments such as single crowns, fixed and removable partial dentures, or further treatment concepts (eg, the shortened dental arch concept) are not well represented. the use of patient-centered outcome measures can help to find an individual, patient-oriented prosthetic solution.
understanding and, ultimately, controlling the properties of amorphous materials is one of the key goals of material science. among the different amorphous structures, a very important role is played by colloidal gels. it has been only recently understood that colloidal gels are the result of the interplay between phase separation and arrest. when short-ranged attractive colloids are quenched into the phase-separating region, density fluctuations are arrested and this results in ramified amorphous space-spanning structures that are capable of sustaining mechanical stress. we present a mechanism of aggregation through arrested demixing in binary colloidal mixtures, which leads to the formation of a yet unexplored class of materials––bigels. this material is obtained by tuning interspecies interactions. using a computer model, we investigate the phase behavior and the structural properties of these bigels. we show the topological similarities and the geometrical differences between these binary, interpenetrating, arrested structures and their well-known monodisperse counterparts, colloidal gels. our findings are supported by confocal microscopy experiments performed on mixtures of dna-coated colloids. the mechanism of bigel formation is a generalization of arrested phase separation and is therefore universal. we numerically investigate the competition between phase separation and dynamical arrest in a colloidal system interacting via a short-ranged attractive potential. equilibrium fluid configurations are quenched at two different temperatures below the critical temperature and followed during their time evolution. at the lowest studied t, the phase-separation process is interrupted by the formation of an attractive glass in the dense phase. at the higher t, no arrest is observed and the phase-separation process proceeds endlessly in the simulated time window. the final structure of the glass retains memory of the interrupted phase-separation process in the form of a frozen spinodal decomposition peak, whose location and amplitude is controlled by the average packing fraction. we also discuss the time evolution of the nonergodicity parameter, providing evidence of a progressively decreasing localization length on increasing the packing fraction. finally, we confirm that the reported results are independent of the microscopic dynamics.
objective: the aim of the present study was to determine the most and least important family needs in a group of family caregivers of individuals with tbi from cali, colombia, and to examine which of those needs were more likely to be met and unmet. design: cross-sectional descriptive study. setting: valle university hospital in cali, colombia. participants: twenty-nine family caregivers of individuals with traumatic brain injury. outcome measure: the family needs questionnaire, a 40-item questionnaire divided into six sub-scales. results: health information, community support network and professional support network sub-scales were the most important needs reported by this group of colombian tbi family caregivers. the most frequently met needs in the present study fell within health information, involvement with care and instrumental support sub-scales and the most frequently unmet needs fell within the emotional support, instrumental support and professional support sub-scales. conclusions: family needs in caregivers of individuals with tbi from colombia are similar, but more likely to be unmet, than those reported in previous studies. interventions designed to meet family caregivers’ needs in these areas should be implemented in colombia. the responses to a questionnaire on subjective burden are reported for 52 primary caregivers of a group of persons with traumatic brain injuries sustained an average of 6 years previously. the aim of the study was to examine satisfaction with social support, perception of coping skills, and appraisal of symptoms as predictors of strain in the carers. a range of responses, both positive and negative, to the work of caring for a relative with a head injury was reported. a high prevalence rate of emotional and behavioural changes in the persons with head injuries was found and the amount of distress caused by these symptoms was found to be predictive of burden. the other factor important in predicting burden was the carers ratings of their satisfaction with their ability to cope with the work of caregiv ing. social support, injury severity, and the demographic characteristics of the persons with head injury and their carers were not significant predictors. depression in the carers was also investigated and the variable most predictive of elevated depression scores was coping satisfaction. these findings reinforce the importance of strengthening carers coping resources in rehabilitation work with head injured persons and their families.
leaves of portulaca oleracea have the potential of regeneration, when grown in a distilled water medium. the two heavy metals, se and hg individually and in combination affected both shoot and root development. they completely arrested shoot development at all concentrations. however, they produced concentration-dependent changes in the development of roots, which ranged from their complete inhibition to variation in their initiation time, number and length. leaf decay was initiated on day 46 in control leaves. concentration-dependent changes were also observed in the time of initiation and magnitude of decay of leaves. the data indicates that hg was more toxic than se. the protective effect of se against hg toxicity was evident only at very low concentrations. with further increases in the concentration of both se and hg, the protective effect decreased and simultaneously the toxicity increased. following the decay of leaves, a pink colour development was observed only on leaves exposed to se. microbial analysis of leaves showed the presence of acinetobacter only in se-exposed leaves. acinetobacter was therefore considered as probably involved in the formation of elemental se, which produced a pink colour. abstract effects of sodium selenate and selenite on the toxic effect of methylmercuric chloride (mmc) on nervous tissue in culture were studied. sliced newborn rat cerebella were cultured in a medium containing mmc and selenate or selenite. the concentrations of sodium selenate and selenite that showed remarkable protective effect against the neurotoxicity of mmc were 0.8 and 0.2 × 10 −5 m , respectively. the protective effect of sodium selenite was additive with that of dl -α-tocopherol acetate (vitamin e). however, 4 × 10 −5 m sodium selenate and 1 × 10 −5 m sodium selenite per se showed an obvious toxic effect on the outgrowth of nerve fibers and cells from cerebellum tissue in culture. the toxicity of selenium was additive to that of mmc. these results indicate that oxidized selenium at low concentrations is able to modify the neurotoxicity of mmc and that different states of selenium produce different degrees of protection. they suggest further that the adverse effect of selenium is additive to the toxicity of alkyl mercurial at the toxic level of selenium.
given the high prevalence of overweight and low levels of physical activity among children, a better understanding of physical activity behaviour is an important step in intervention planning. this study, based on the theory of planned behaviour, was conducted among 313 fifth graders and their parents. children completed a computer-based questionnaire to evaluate theoretical constructs and behaviour. additional information was obtained from parents by means of a questionnaire. correlates of children's physical activity were intention and self-identity. determinants of intention were self-efficacy, self-identity, and attitude. parental variables were mediated through cognitions. among girls, practicing sedentary activities was an additional negative determinant of intention. key beliefs of boys and girls were related to time management and difficulties associated with physical activity. for girls, social identification as an active girl was another important belief related to positive intention. this study provides theory-based information for the development of more effective interventions aimed at promoting physical activity among children. we examined predictors of leisure-time physical activity intention and behaviour in children, and the potential direct and moderating effects of gender and ethnicity. participants were 364 (230 asian; 134 caucasian) 9-11-year-old children who completed measures of the theory of planned behaviour (tpb) and physical activity behaviour (physical activity questionnaire for children) across three, 3-month intervals (i.e., two prediction time-periods) in canada. the tpb explained 35-50% of the variance in physical activity behaviour and 74-76% of the variance in intention using structural equation modelling. an autoregressive longitudinal path model showed that the tpb predicted changes in physical activity and physical activity predicted changes in tpb constructs (p<.05). overall, intention and perceived behavioural control were significant (p<.05) contributors to the direct prediction of behaviour and subjective norm and perceived behavioural control were significant (p<.05) predictors of intention. gender did not show a robust relationship with physical activity or intention, but the effect of ethnicity on physical activity was mediated through perceived behavioural control (asians less active than caucasians). finally, gender and ethnicity did not moderate tpb and physical activity relations (p<.05). these data suggest that childhood may be a formative stage for the development of physical activity cognitions and that promoting physical activity in children may require normative and control-based intervention.
a work was conducted to study the effect of putrescine and l-glutamine supplementation on histomorphology of small intestine in broiler chickens. five groups of ten chicks each in three replicates reared up to 42 days were used for this study. putrescine and l-glutamine were orally supplemented at 0% level as control (t1), putrescine 0.05% (t2), putrescine 0.1% (t3), l-glutamine 0.5% (t4) and l-glutamine 1% (t5) from 0 day to 7 days after hatch. at 2nd and 3rd week of age, 3 birds from each groupwere slaughtered and tissue samples from small intestine (duodenum, jejunum and ileum) were collected for histomorphological studies. statistically significant (p<0.01) increase in duodenal and jejunal villi length, width,crypt length and ileal villi length and width were observed in l-glutamine fed groups than putrescine and control groups. there was no significant difference in duodenal crypt length/width, jejunal crypt width and ileal crypt length/width. it can be inferred that l-glutamine promoted the intestinal villi development during early posthatch life, thus increasing the nutrients absorption and growth performance as body weight gain in broiler chickens. previous studies have shown that the feeding of putrescine, a biogenic amine and the precursor of the mammalian polyamines, can promote whole-body growth of chicks. the current study was undertaken to determine the effect of spermine, also a biogenic amine and the most cationic of the polyamines, under similar conditions. in exp. 1, 120 week-old chicks were fed purified crystalline amino acid-based diets containing 0, .2, .4, .6, .8, or 1.0% spermine for 14 d. spermine proved highly toxic and growth rates were reduced compared with controls when even .2% was fed. in exp. 2, chicks were fed 0, .0375, .0750, or .1000% spermine. these concentrations proved less toxic than those used in exp. 1. supplemental dietary cysteine was then provided at 0, .3, .6, and .9% together with 0, .025, .050, or .400% spermine (exp. 3) because depletion of cellular glutathione has been suggested as contributing to spermine's toxicity. even high levels of cysteine supplementation did not overcome spermine's toxicity. subsequent dietary provision of l-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (otc, exp. 4), a cysteine prodrug, showed that depletion of cellular glutathione was not likely a cause of spermine toxicosis. a trend toward increased weight gain and feed efficiency was observed when low concentrations of spermine were fed. it was concluded, however, that dietary spermine was more toxic to chicks than was previously seen for putrescine, that any growth-promoting effects of dietary spermine are small, and that supplements of dietary cysteine or otc are unlikely to increase these effects by overcoming spermine toxicosis.
kelleher zt, potts en, brahmajothi mv, foster mw, auten rl, foster wm, marshall he. nos2 regulation of lps-induced airway inflammation via s-nitrosylation of nfb p65. am j physiol lung cell mol physiol 301: l327–l333, 2011. first published july 1, 2011; doi:10.1152/ajplung.00463.2010.—inducible nitric oxide synthase (nos2) expression is increased in the airway epithelium in acute inflammatory disorders although the physiological impact remains unclear. we have previously shown that nos2 inhibits nfb (p50-p65) activation in respiratory epithelial cells by inducing snitrosylation of the p65 monomer (sno-p65). in addition, we have demonstrated that mouse lung sno-p65 levels are acutely depleted in a lipopolysaccharide (lps) model of lung injury and that augmenting sno-p65 levels before lps treatment results in decreased airway epithelial nfb activation, airway inflammation, and lung injury. we now show that aerosolized lps induces nos2 expression in the respiratory epithelium concomitant with an increase in lung sno-p65 levels and a decrease in airway nfb activity. genetic deletion of nos2 results in an absence of sno-p65 formation, persistent nfb activity in the respiratory epithelium, and prolonged airway inflammation. these results indicate that a primary function of lps-induced nos2 expression in the respiratory epithelium is to modulate the inflammatory response through deactivation of nfb via s-nitrosylation of p65, thereby counteracting the initial stimulus-coupled denitrosylation. airway s-nitrosothiols (snos) are naturally occurring bronchodilators. snos, nitrate, and nitrite were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of 23 patients with cystic fibrosis (cf) and mild pulmonary disease (aged 6-16 years) and 13 healthy children (aged 8-15 years). concentrations of snos were decreased in the lower airways of patients with cf and mild pulmonary disease (median, range: 0, 0-320 nmol/l vs 80, 0-970 nmol/l) despite normal levels of the inert nitric oxide metabolites nitrate and nitrite (mean +/- sem: 3.7 +/- 0.5 micromol/l vs 4.8 +/- 0.9 micromol/l). s-nitrosolation- mediated bioreactivities may be impaired by depletion of the cf airway sno reservoir.
in this study, the antibacterial activity of essential oil from chamaecyparis obtusa (sieb. et zucc) leaves and twigs was investigated. the test strains were klebsiella pneumoniae, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, legionella pneumophila, and methicilline-resistant staphylococcus aureus. antibacterial activity was estimated by measuring bacterial growth inhibition. histopathological examination was also performed. c. obtusa oil distinctly inhibited the growth of all test strains and exhibited the strongest antibacterial activity against l. monocytogenes. it was chromatographically divided into several fractions. the fractions were further tested against antibacterial activity and their chemical compositions were analyzed. the fraction containing terpinen-4-ol (ta) showed high antibacterial activity toward all strains tested. tests with authentic samples showed that ta played a major role in the antibacterial activity of c. obtusa oil, and in a mice test, the oil actively minimized inflammation by s. aureus. essential oil from achillea fragrantissima exerted a bactericidic effect on several gram positive and gram negative bacterial strains, as well as on candida albicans. the oil was fractionated on sillica gel columns by a gradient of ether in petrol ether (30 degrees c-40 degrees c). two fractions which contained less polar compounds were active against c. albicans only. the fractions which contained more polar compounds inhibited the growth of all the microorganisms tested. one of these compounds was identified as terpinen-4-ol. commercial terpinen-4-ol had a similar antimicrobial activity.
objective the purpose of this study was to determine whether lobectomy without radical systematic mediastinal lymphadenectomy (la) is a satisfactory alternative surgical treatment for octogenarians with clinical stage i non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc).   methods from april 1985 through december 2001, 49 patients aged 80 years and older who underwent surgical treatment for clinical stage i nsclc were reviewed. lobectomy without radical systematic mediastinal la was performed for 27 patients (la0 group) and lobectomy with radical systematic mediastinal la was performed for 22 patients (la group).   results the mortality rate was 0% in the la0 group and 4.5% in the la group. five-year survival rate according to the type of surgery was 44.8% in the la0 group and 55.5% in the la group, a difference that was not significant (p=0.88). although there was no significant statistical difference, postoperative pulmonary complication was more frequent in the la group than in the la0 group (32% in the la group versus 11% in the la0 group p=0.07). five-year survival rates according to serum carcinoembryonic antigen (cea) levels were 0% for patients with elevated cea levels (n=9) and 56.5% for patients with normal cea levels (n=40) (p<0.01).   conclusion lobectomy without radical systematic mediastinal la appears to be a satisfactory surgical procedure for octogenarians with clinical stage i nsclc. however, mediastinoscopy is necessary in such octogenarians if their serum cea level is elevated so that the precise clinical stage can be determined and an accurate prognosis can be given. background octogenarians often present with potentially resectable bronchogenic carcinoma. older reports noting prohibitive mortality and recent surveys documenting continued substantial risk raise concerns about the applicability of operation in this age group.   methods we reviewed the short-term and long-term results of pulmonary resection for intended cure of lung cancer in patients 80 years and older operated on from 1980 through 1995. our surgical philosophy favored lobectomy over lesser resection and generally avoided pneumonectomy in the elderly.   results fifty-four octogenarians underwent resection: 43 lobectomies, 2 extended lobectomies, 2 bilobectomies, 3 segmentectomies, 3 wedge excisions, and 1 pneumonectomy. there were two perioperative deaths (3.7%). the overall nonfatal complication rate was 42%, with a major complication rate of 11%. postoperative stay decreased from 8.1 days overall to 6.3 days in the last 3 years. only 3 patients required temporary convalescent care after discharge. actuarial survival at 1,3, and 5 years was 86%, 62%, and 43%, respectively, for all discharged patients (n = 52) and 97%, 78%, and 57% for stage i cases (n = 39). patients with tumors beyond stage i fared poorly.   conclusions advanced age per se in neither a contraindication to curative resection nor a routine indication for nonanatomic operations in healthy octogenarians with stage i lung cancer. with proper selection, acute risk should be low. pneumonectomy, extended resection, and operation for stage ii or iii disease should be considered only in exceptional cases.
methotrexate has a clinically important pharmacokinetic interaction with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) mainly through its competition for tubular secretion via the renal organic anion transporter 3 (oat3). we have previously reported the usefulness of oat3-transfected renal tubular cells for screening of the drugs which interfere with the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate. celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase (cox) 2 inhibitor, has not been reported to interact with methotrexate, but the mechanisms are unclear why the interaction did not occur. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of celecoxib on methotrexate tubular secretion using a renal cell line stably expressing human oat3 (s2-hoat3), and to evaluate the pharmacokinetic interaction of the two drugs in rats. [3h]methotrexate uptake into s2-hoat3 cells was significantly inhibited by celecoxib in a concentration-dependent manner and the ki value was 35.3 microm. however, methotrexate serum concentrations and urinary excretion of methotrexate over 24 h in rats were not affected by celecoxib (50, 200 mg/kg). celecoxib serum concentrations were increased by the increase in celecoxib dosage and the maximum drug concentration (cmax) was 20.6 microm (celecoxib 200 mg/kg), which did not reach the ki value obtained in the in vitro study. these results indicated that celecoxib inhibited the secretion of methotrexate via hoat3, which suggested that celecoxib was a substrate of hoat3. however, co-administration of the two drugs at clinical dosage did not affect the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate, because the serum concentrations did not reach the ki value. although the accumulation study using s2-hoat3 cells was useful to predict the interaction between the new drug and methotrexate in vivo, a comparison of the ki value with the cmax in clinical dosage was necessary to evaluate the degree of this interaction. the plasma protein binding of celecoxib was determined for animals and humans using in vitro and ex vivo methods. eight, healthy, human volunteers (three male, five female, 20–39 years) received celecoxib (600 mg) bid for 7 days, blood samples were collected and concentrations of bound and unbound celecoxib determined. the fraction of bound drug in the volunteers was constant (97.4±0.1%) at total celecoxib plasma concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 4.02 μg/ml. the ex vivo plasma protein binding of celecoxib in the animals was concentration‐independent up to approximately 12, 8 and 10 μg/ml for mouse, rat and dog, respectively. the plasma protein binding of celecoxib after a single oral dose of 10 and 300 mg/kg to mice was 98.3±0.2%, of 1 and 400 mg/kg to rats was 98.3±0.2% and of 1 and 100 mg/kg to dogs was 98.5±0.1%. the percent binding of celecoxib to plasma proteins in vitro was slightly lower than those values determined ex vivo. the in vitro binding of celecoxib to plasma protein was constant over the concentrations of 0.1–10 μg/ml for all species, except rat. copyright © 1999 john wiley & sons, ltd.
study sequence can have a profound impact on learning. previous research has often shown advantages for interleaved over blocked study, though the reverse has also been found. learners typically prefer blocking even in situations for which interleaving is superior. the present study investigated learner regulation of study sequence, and its effects on learning in an ecologically valid context – university students using an online tutorial relevant to an exam that counted toward their course grades. the majority of participants blocked study by problem category, and this tendency was positively associated with subsequent exam performance. the results suggest that preference for blocked study may be adaptive under some circumstances, and highlight the importance of identifying task environments under which different study sequences are most effective. kornell and bjork (psychological science 19:585–592, 2008) found that interleaving exemplars of different categories enhanced inductive learning of the concepts based on those exemplars. they hypothesized that the benefit of mixing exemplars from different categories is that doing so highlights differences between the categories. kang and pashler (applied cognitive psychology 26:97–103, 2012) obtained results consistent with this discriminative-contrast hypothesis: interleaving enhanced inductive learning, but temporal spacing, which does not highlight category differences, did not. we further tested the discriminative-contrast hypothesis by examining the effects of interleaving and spacing, as well as their combined effects. in three experiments, using photographs of butterflies and birds as the stimuli, temporal spacing was harmful when it interrupted the juxtaposition of interleaved categories, even when total spacing was held constant, supporting the discriminative-contrast hypothesis. temporal spacing also had value, however, when it did not interrupt discrimination processing.
the serotonin1a (5-ht1a) receptor is an important member of the superfamily of seven transmembrane domain g-protein-coupled receptors. we have examined the modulatory role of cholesterol on the ligand binding of the bovine hippocampal 5-ht1a receptor by cholesterol complexation in native membranes using digitonin. complexation of cholesterol from bovine hippocampal membranes using digitonin results in a concentration-dependent reduction in specific binding of the agonist 8-oh-dpat and antagonist p-mppf to 5-ht1a receptors. the corresponding changes in membrane order were monitored by analysis of fluorescence polarization data of the membrane depth-specific probes, dph and tma-dph. taken together, our results point out the important role of membrane cholesterol in maintaining the function of the 5-ht1a receptor. an important aspect of these results is that non-availability of free cholesterol in the membrane due to complexation with digitonin rather than physical depletion is sufficient to significantly reduce the 5-ht1a receptor function. these results provide a comprehensive understanding of the effects of the sterol-complexing agent digitonin in particular, and the role of membrane cholesterol in general, on the 5-ht1a receptor function. to investigate the effect of cholesterol on the oxytocin receptor function in myometrial membranes, we developed a new method to alter the membrane cholesterol content. using a methyl-substituted beta-cyclodextrin, we were able to selectively deplete the myometrial plasma membrane of cholesterol. vice versa, incubating cholesterol-depleted membranes with a preformed soluble cholesterol-methyl-beta-cyclodextrin complex restored the cholesterol content of the plasma membrane. binding experiments showed that, with the removal of cholesterol from the membrane, the dissociation constant for [3h]oxytocin is enhanced 87-fold (from kd = 1.5 nm to kd = 131 nm), therefore shifting the oxytocin receptor from high to low affinity. increasing the cholesterol content of the cholesterol-depleted membrane again restored the high-affinity binding (kd = 1.2 nm). the presence of 0.1 mm gtp gamma s did not significantly change the number of high-affinity binding sites for [3h]oxytocin in native plasma membranes, in membranes depleted of cholesterol, and in plasma membranes with restored cholesterol content. the number of high-affinity binding sites for the oxytocin antagonist [3h]prota was dependent in the same way on the cholesterol content as for [3h]oxytocin. substitution of the membrane cholesterol with other steroids showed a strong dependence of the oxytocin receptor function on the structure of the cholesterol molecule. the detergent-solubilized oxytocin receptor was not saturable with [3h]oxytocin even at concentrations up to 10(-6) m of radioligand. addition of the cholesterol-methyl-beta-cyclodextrin complex to the detergent-solubilized oxytocin receptor induced a saturation of the solubilized binding sites (bmax = 0.98 pmol/mg) for oxytocin (kd = 16 nm).(abstract truncated at 250 words)
changes in conscious level have been associated with changes in dynamical integration and segregation among distributed brain regions. recent theoretical developments emphasize changes in directed functional (i.e., causal) connectivity as reflected in quantities such as ‘integrated information’ and ‘causal density’. here we develop and illustrate a rigorous methodology for assessing causal connectivity from electroencephalographic (eeg) signals using granger causality (gc). our method addresses the challenges of non-stationarity and bias by dividing data into short segments and applying permutation analysis. we apply the method to eeg data obtained from subjects undergoing propofol-induced anaesthesia, with signals source-localized to the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices. we found significant increases in bidirectional gc in most subjects during loss-of-consciousness, especially in the beta and gamma frequency ranges. corroborating a previous analysis we also found increases in synchrony in these ranges; importantly, the granger causality analysis showed higher inter-subject consistency than the synchrony analysis. finally, we validate our method using simulated data generated from a model for which gc values can be analytically derived. in summary, our findings advance the methodology of granger causality analysis of eeg data and carry implications for integrated information and causal density theories of consciousness. study objectives the electrophysiological correlates of anesthetic sedation remain poorly understood. we used high-density electroencephalography (hd-eeg) and source modeling to investigate the cortical processes underlying propofol anesthesia and compare them to sleep.   design 256-channel eeg recordings in humans during propofol anesthesia.   setting hospital operating room.   patients or participants 8 healthy subjects (4 males).   interventions n/a.   measurements and results initially, propofol induced increases in eeg power from 12-25 hz. loss of consciousness (loc) was accompanied by the appearance of eeg slow waves that resembled the slow waves of nrem sleep. we compared slow waves in propofol to slow waves recorded during natural sleep and found that both populations of waves share similar cortical origins and preferentially propagate along the mesial components of the default network. however, propofol slow waves were spatially blurred compared to sleep slow waves and failed to effectively entrain spindle activity. propofol also caused an increase in gamma (25-40 hz) power that persisted throughout loc. source modeling analysis showed that this increase in gamma power originated from the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices. during loc, we found increased gamma functional connectivity between these regions compared to the wakefulness.   conclusions propofol anesthesia is a sleep-like state and slow waves are associated with diminished consciousness even in the presence of high gamma activity.
background total knee arthroplasty (tka) is usually associated with severe postoperative pain, which can prevent rehabilitation of patients' knee function and influence the satisfaction of surgery. local infiltration analgesia (lia) as a new method to managing postoperative pain has been applied in clinical practice recently. however, the safety and efficacy of lia compared with femoral nerve block (fnb) in postoperative pain management of tka still remains controversial. thus, we conducted an original clinical trial to compare lia and fnb.   method one hundred fifty-seven patients undergoing tka were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, single-center study. the patients received either fnb (group a) or periarticular infiltration of local anesthetic (group b). the morphine consumption used in patient-controlled analgesia after surgery, postoperative visual analogue scale (vas), knee society score, and range of motion before and after surgery in both groups were analyzed, as well as the adverse effects.   results group a consisted 78 patients, and group b contained 79 patients. the patients' characteristics including age and body mass index had no significant difference (p > .05). morphine consumption, vas at rest, range of motion, and knee society score were similar between the 2 groups. our study showed group b, the local anesthetic group had less vas with movement on postoperative day 1 (p = .01) than that of group a, which means a better pain control. because of the study design, the surgery time showed no significant difference. eighteen patients in group a and 21 patients in group b experienced mild-to-medium nausea or vomiting. one patient in group b had dizziness and one patient in group a suffered a neuropraxic injury to the femoral nerve. no urinary retention case was seen during inpatient days. there were no significant differences between the 2 groups about side effects.   conclusions our research showed that no significant differences were observed between the 2 treatment groups. lia could provide a similar analgesic effect to fnbs with a low incidence of complications. background we report a prospective blinded randomised trial of local infiltration versus femoral nerve block in patients undergoing primary total knee replacement (tkr), in accordance with the consort statement 2010.   methods fifty patients in a teaching hospital were consented for the study. the study arms were intraoperative local anaesthesia (150ml 0.2% ropivacaine/1ml 1:1000 adrenaline/30mg ketolorac) and femoral nerve block (30ml 0.2% ropivacaine) with a primary outcome of pain score at 4h post operatively. secondary outcomes were pain at 2h, pain scores before and after physiotherapy on day one, total opiate administered, time to physiotherapy goals and length of stay. randomisation was by sealed envelope. the assessor was blinded and the patients partially blinded to the intervention.   results ten patients were excluded, eight before randomisation. the trial is complete. forty patients were analysed for the primary outcome measure. the local infiltration group had significantly lower pain scores at 4h post-operatively; mean [sd] score 2.1 [2.6] versus 6.8 [3.2], p<0.00001 and on post-operative day one prior to physiotherapy; mean score 2.4 [2.3] versus 4.4 [2.3], p<0.05. total opiate use was also significantly lower in the local infiltration group; mean total 115 [50.3]mg versus 176.5 [103.5]mg, p<0.01. there was no difference in any other outcome. there were no harms as a result of either intervention.   conclusion intraoperative local infiltration gives superior pain relief compared to single shot femoral nerve block over the first 24h following primary tkr and minimises post-operative opiate use.
purposeusing prospectively collected patient-related, dose-related, and pulmonary function test (pft) data before radiotherapy (rt) and at several follow-up visits after rt, the time course of pft changes after high-dose radio(chemo)therapy and influencing factors were analyzed.materials and methodsfrom april 2012 to october 2015, 81 patients with non-small-cell lung carcinoma (nsclc), small cell lung carcinoma (sclc), or esophageal carcinoma where treated with high-dose radio(chemo)therapy. pft data were collected before treatment and 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months after rt. the influence of patient- and treatment-related factors on pft was analyzed.resultsmean forced expiratory volume in 1 s (fev1) constantly declined during follow-up (p = 0.001). in total, 68% of patients had a reduced fev1 at 6 months. mean vital capacity (vc) didn’t change during follow-up (p > 0.05). mean total lung capacity (tlc) showed a constant decline after rt (p = 0.026). at 6 months, 60% of patients showed a decline in vc and 73% in tlc. the mean diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (dlco) declined at 6 and 12 weeks, but recovered slightly at 6 months (p < 0.0005). at 6 months, 86% of patients had a reduced dlco. after treatment, the partial pressure of co2 in the blood (pco2) was increased and po2 was decreased (p > 0.05). only the pretreatment pft classification had a significant influence on the post-rt fev1.conclusiondlco seems to be the most reliable indicator for lung tissue damage after thoracic rt. ventilation parameters appear to be less reliable. concerning patient- or treatment-related factors, no reliable conclusion can be drawn regarding which factors may be relevant.zusammenfassunghintergrundpatientenbezogene, therapiebezogene und lungenfunktionsdaten

underwent postoperative locoregional breast rt. pfts were performed before rt and 3, 6, and 12 months and 8 to 10 years after rt. by use of univariate and multivariate analyses, the impact of treatment- and patient-related factors on late changes in pfts was evaluated.   results during the first year after rt, all pfts significantly worsened at 3 to 6 months after rt (p < 0.05). at 12 months, forced vital capacity (fvc), vital capacity (vc), and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (fev(1)) recovered almost to baseline values, whereas total lung capacity (tlc) and diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (dl(co)) recovered only slightly and were still found to be decreased compared with baseline (p < 0.05). at 8 to 10 years after rt, mean reductions in fev(1) of 4% (p = 0.03) and in vc, dl(co), and tlc of 5%, 9%, and 11% (all p < 0.0001), respectively, were observed compared with pre-rt values. on multivariate analysis, tamoxifen use negatively affected tlc at 8 to 10 years after rt (p = 0.033), whereas right-sided irradiation was associated with a late reduction in fev(1) (p = 0.027). for fev(1) and dl(co), an early decrease was predictive for a late decrease (p = 0.003 and p = 0.0009, respectively).   conclusions the time course of pft changes after locoregional rt for breast cancer follows a biphasic pattern. an early reduction in pfts at 3 to 6 months with a partial recovery at 12 months after rt is followed by a late, more important pft reduction up to 8 to 10 years after rt. tamoxifen use may have an impact on this late decline in pfts.
to improve biosurfactant production economics by the utilization of potential low‐cost materials. the fermentative production of rhamnolipid biosurfactant from pseudomonas aeruginosa mtcc 2297 was carried out by submerged fermentation using various cost-effective waste materials such as orange peelings, carrot peel waste, lime peelings, coconut oil cake, and banana waste. the orange peel was found to be the best substrate generating 9.18 g/l of rhamnolipid biosurfactant with a surface tension reduction up to 31.3 mn/m. the production was growth independent, and optimum conditions were standardized. the emulsifying activity was highest against kerosene (73.3%). rhamnolipid components were purified and separated by ethyl acetate extraction, preparative silica gel column chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography and thin-layer chromatography. the major rhamnolipid components were characterized, by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, as a mixture of dirhamnolipids and monorhamnolipids.
compared with the well-studied biochemical function of nucleosome assembly protein1 (nap1) as a histone chaperone in nucleosome assembly/disassembly, the physiological roles of nap1 remain largely uncharacterized. here, we define the nap1 gene family members in arabidopsis, examine their molecular properties, and use reverse genetics to characterize their biological roles. we show that the four atnap1-group proteins can form homodimers and heterodimers, can bind histone h2a, and are localized abundantly in the cytoplasm and weakly in the nucleus at steady state. atnap1;4 differs from the others by showing inhibitor-sensitive nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and tissue-specific expression, restricted to root segments and pollen grains. the other three atnap1 genes are ubiquitously expressed in plants and the atnap1;3 protein is detected as the major isoform in seedlings. we show that disruption of the atnap1-group genes does not affect normal plant growth under our laboratory conditions. interestingly, two allelic triple mutants, atnap1;1-1 atnap1;2-1 atnap1;3-1 and atnap1;1-1 atnap1;2-1 atnap1;3-2, exhibit perturbed genome transcription, and show hypersensitivity to dna damage caused by uv-c irradiation. we show that atnap1;3 binds chromatin, with enrichment at some genes involved in the nucleotide excision repair (ner) pathway, and that the expression of these genes is downregulated in the triple mutants. taken together, our results highlight conserved and isoform-specific properties of atnap1 proteins, and unravel their function in the ner pathway of dna damage repair. the shoot apical meristem (sam) of seed plants is the site at which lateral organs are formed. once organ primordia initiate from the sam, they establish polarity along the adaxial-abaxial, proximodistal and mediolateral axes. among these three axes, the adaxial-abaxial polarity is of primary importance in leaf patterning. in leaf development, once the adaxial-abaxial axis is established within leaf primordia, it provides cues for proper lamina growth and asymmetric development. it was reported previously that the arabidopsis asymmetric leaves1 (as1) and asymmetric leaves2 (as2) genes are two key regulators of leaf polarity. in this work, we demonstrate a new function of the as1 and as2 genes in the establishment of adaxial-abaxial polarity by analyzing as1 and as2 alleles in the landsberg erecta (ler) genetic background. we provide genetic evidence that the arabidopsis erecta (er) gene is involved in the as1-as2 pathway to promote leaf adaxial fate. in addition, we show that as1 and as2 bind to each other, suggesting that as1 and as2 may form a complex that regulates the establishment of leaf polarity. we also report the effects on leaf polarity of overexpression of the as1 or as2 genes under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (camv) 35s promoter. although plants with as1 and as2 mutations have very similar phenotypes, 35s::as1/ler and 35s::as2/ler transgenic plants showed dramatically different morphologies. a possible model of the as1, as2 and er action in leaf polarity formation is discussed.
the striatum is the key site for cortical input to the basal ganglia. cortical input to striatal microcircuits has been previously studied only in the context of one or two types of neurons. here, we provide the first description of four putative types of striatal neurons (medium spiny, fast spiking, tonically active, and low-threshold spiking) in a single data set by separating extracellular recordings of sorted single spikes recorded under halothane anesthesia using waveform and burst parameters. under halothane, the electrocorticograms and striatal local field potential displayed spontaneous oscillations at both low (2–9 hz) and high (35–80 hz) frequencies. putative fast spiking interneurons were significantly more likely to phase lock to high-frequency cortical oscillations and displayed significant cross-correlations in this frequency range. these findings suggest that, as in neocortex and hippocampus, the coordinated activity of fast spiking interneurons may specifically be involved in mediating oscillatory synchronization in the striatum. discharge activities and local field potentials were recorded in the orofacial motor cortex and in the corresponding rostrolateral striatum of urethane-anesthetized rats. striatal projection neurons were identified by antidromic activation and fast-spiking gabaergic interneurons (fsis) by their unique characteristics: briefer spike and burst responses. juxtacellular injection of neurobiotin combined with parvalbumin immunohistochemistry validated this identification. spontaneous activities and spike responses to cortical stimulation were recorded during both states of cortical activity: slow waves and desynchronization. both fsi and projection neurons spontaneously discharged synchronously with slow waves at the maximum of cortical activity, but, on average, fsis were much more active. cortical desynchronization enhanced fsi activity and facilitated their spike responses to cortical stimulation, whereas opposite effects were observed regarding projection neurons. experimental conditions favoring fsi discharge were always associated with a decrease in the firing activity of projection neurons. spike responses to cortical stimulation occurred earlier (latency difference, 4.6 ms) and with a lower stimulation current for fsis than for projection neurons. moreover, blocking gabaa receptors by local picrotoxin injection enhanced the spike response of projection neurons, and this increase was larger in experimental conditions favoring fsi responses. therefore, on average, fsis exert in vivo a powerful feedforward inhibition on projection neurons. however, a few projection neurons were actually more sensitive to cortical stimulation than fsis. moreover, picrotoxin, which revealed fsi inhibition, preferentially affected projection neurons exhibiting the weakest sensitivity to cortical stimulation. thus, feedforward inhibition by fsis filters cortical information effectively transmitted by striatal projection neurons.
backgroundstudies have shown a relationship between air pollution and increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. due to the complexity of ambient air pollution composition, recent studies have examined the effects of co-exposure, particularly particulate matter (pm) and gas, to determine whether pollutant interactions alter (e.g. synergistically, antagonistically) the health response. this study examines the independent effects of fine (fcaps) and ultrafine (ufcaps) concentrated ambient particles on cardiac function, and determine the impact of ozone (o3) co-exposure on the response. we hypothesized that ufcaps would cause greater decrement in mechanical function and electrical dysfunction than fcaps, and that o3 co-exposure would enhance the effects of both particle-types.methodsconscious/unrestrained radiotelemetered mice were exposed once whole-body to either 190 μg/m3 fcaps or 140 μg/m3 ufcaps with/without 0.3 ppm o3; separate groups were exposed to either filtered air (fa) or o3 alone. heart rate (hr) and electrocardiogram (ecg) were recorded continuously before, during and after exposure, and cardiac mechanical function was assessed using a langendorff perfusion preparation 24 hrs post-exposure.resultsfcaps alone caused a significant decrease in baseline left ventricular developed pressure (lvdp) and contractility, whereas ufcaps did not; neither fcaps nor ufcaps alone caused any ecg changes. o3 co-exposure with fcaps caused a significant decrease in heart rate variability when compared to fa but also blocked the decrement in cardiac function. on the other hand, o3 co-exposure with ufcaps significantly increased qrs-interval, qtc and non-conducted p-wave arrhythmias, and decreased lvdp, rate of contractility and relaxation when compared to controls.conclusionsthese data suggest that particle size and gaseous interactions may play a role in cardiac function decrements one day after exposure. although fcaps + o3 only altered autonomic balance, ufcaps + o3 appeared to be more serious by increasing cardiac arrhythmias and causing mechanical decrements. as such, o3 appears to interact differently with fcaps and ufcaps, resulting in varied cardiac changes, which suggests that the cardiovascular effects of particle-gas co-exposures are not simply additive or even generalizable. additionally, the mode of toxicity underlying this effect may be subtle given none of the exposures described here impaired post-ischemia recovery. background human controlled-exposure studies have assessed the impact of ambient fine particulate matter on cardiac autonomic function measured by heart rate variability (hrv), but whether these effects are modified by concomitant ozone exposure remains unknown. objective in this study we assessed the impact of o3 and particulate matter exposure on hrv in humans. methods in a crossover design, 50 subjects (19–48 years of age) were randomized to 2-hr controlled exposures to filtered air (fa), concentrated ambient particles (caps), o3, or combined caps and ozone (caps + o3). the primary end point was change in hrv between the start and end of exposure. secondary analyses included blood pressure (bp) responses, and effect modification by asthmatic status. results achieved mean caps and o3 exposure concentrations were 121.6 ± 48.0 μg/m3 and 113.9 ± 6.6 ppb, respectively. in a categorical analysis, exposure had no consistent effect on hrv indices. however, the dose–response relationship between caps mass concentration and hrv indices seemed to vary depending on the presence of o3. this heterogeneity was statistically significant for the low-frequency component of hrv (p = 0.02) and approached significance for the high-frequency component and time-domain measures of hrv. exposure to caps + o3 increased diastolic bp by 2.0 mmhg (se, 1.2; p = 0.02). no other statistically significant changes in bp were observed. asthmatic status did not modify these effects. conclusion the potentiation by o3 of caps effects on diastolic bp and possibly hrv is of small magnitude in young adults. further studies are needed to assess potential effects in more vulnerable populations.
aims/hypothesisthe expression of tissue-specific self-antigens in the thymus is essential for self-tolerance. genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes correlates inversely with thymic insulin expression and, in mice, lowered levels of this expression result in t cell responses against insulin. this study was undertaken to examine whether thymic insulin expression is regulated by the same metabolic stimuli as in beta cells or by different inputs, possibly of an immune nature.methodsins2 mrna changes in mouse thymus were evaluated in vivo, following intraperitoneal glucose injection. we also examined the effect of a high glucose concentration on ins2 mrna in clones of insulin-expressing medullary thymus epithelial cell lines (mtecs). the same in vitro system was used to evaluate the effect of ifn-γ and cell-to-cell contact with thymocytes in co-culture.resultsins2 mrna was significantly increased in the pancreas following a glucose load, but remained unchanged in the thymus. furthermore, stimulation of insulin-expressing mtecs in vitro with ifn-γ, a cytokine involved in t cell negative selection, decreased levels of insulin expression even though expression of aire was increased. last, co-culture of mtecs with thymocytes resulted in an upregulation of both aire and insulin expression.conclusions/interpretationwe conclude that regulation of insulin transcription in the thymus is not dependent on metabolic stimuli but it may, instead, be under the control of cytokines and cell-to-cell interactions with lymphoid cells. that this regulation is not always coordinated with that of aire, a non-specific master switch, suggests insulin-specific mechanisms. cd7 and cd28 are ig superfamily molecules expressed on thymocytes and mature t cells that share common signaling 0mechanisms and are co-mitogens for t cell activation. cd7-deficient mice are resistant to lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced shock syndrome, and have diminished in vivo lps-triggered ifn-gamma and tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha production. cd28-deficient mice have decreased serum ig levels, defective igg isotype switching, decreased t cell il-2 production and are resistant to staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin-induced shock. to determine synergistic roles cd7 and cd28 might play in thymocyte development and function, we have generated and characterized cd7/cd28 double-deficient mice. cd7/cd28-deficient mice were healthy, reproduced normally, had normal numbers of thymocyte subsets and had normal thymus histology. anti-cd3 mab induced similar levels of apoptosis in cd7-deficient, cd28-deficient and cd7/cd28 double-deficient thymocytes as in control c57bl/6 mice (p = ns). similarly, thymocyte viability, apoptosis and necrosis following ionomycin or dexamethasone treatment were the same in control, cd7-deficient, cd28-deficient and cd7/cd28-deficient mice. cd28-deficient and cd7/cd28-deficient thymocytes had decreased [3h]thymidine incorporation responses to concanavalin a (con a) stimulation compared to control mice (p < or = 0.01 and p < or = 0.05 respectively). cd7/cd28 double-deficient mice had significantly reduced numbers of b7-1/b7-2 double-positive cells compared to freshly isolated wild-type, cd7-deficient and cd28-deficient thymocytes. con a-stimulated cd4/cd8 double-negative (dn) thymocytes from cd7/cd28 double-deficient mice expressed significantly lower levels of cd25 when compared to cd4/cd8 dn thymocytes from wild-type, cd7-deficient and cd28-deficient mice (p < 0.05). anti-cd3-triggered cd7/cd28-deficient thymocytes also had decreased ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha production compared to c57bl/6 control, cd7-deficient and cd28-deficient mice (p < or = 0.05). thus, cd7 and cd28 deficiencies combined to produce abnormalities in the absolute number of b7-1/b7-2-expressing cells in the thymus, thymocyte il-2 receptor expression and cd3-triggered cytokine production.
anhedonia, as a deficit symptom, may be associated with default-mode hypofrontality in schizophrenia. to explore whether trait anhedonia in schizophrenia pertains to altered hypofrontal resting state brain function, resting state metabolic activities were compared and correlated with the physical and social anhedonia scale scores in 29 patients with schizophrenia and 21 healthy controls using (18)f-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)f-fdg-pet). in patients with schizophrenia, physical anhedonia scale scores showed a trend-level negative correlation with the hypoactive dorsomedial prefrontal metabolism while positive and negative symptom scale (panss) negative subscale scores positively correlated with hyperactive cerebellar metabolism. voxelwise correlation analysis showed physical anhedonia correlates in resting state activities of the supplementary motor area, ventromedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, insular gyrus, and the precuneus in patients with schizophrenia while no frontal metabolic correlates were found in healthy controls. the hypoactive dorsomedial prefrontal metabolism correlated with physical anhedonia-correlated resting state regional activities. these findings provide further evidence for the relation of functional hypofrontality to the deficit syndrome and possible involvement of the functional imbalance in the cortico-cerebellar-thalamic-cortical circuit in the resting state brain function of schizophrenia. background there have been reports that patients with schizophrenia have decreased metabolic activity in prefrontal cortex. however, findings have been confounded by medication effects, chronic illness, and difficulties of measurement. we aimed to address these problems by examination of cerebral blood flow with positron emission tomography (pet).   methods we studied 17 neuroleptic-naïve patients at the early stages of illness by means of image analysis and statistical methods that can detect abnormalities at the gyral level.   findings an initial omnibus test with a randomisation analysis indicated that patients differed from normal controls at the 0.06 level. in the follow-up analysis, three separate prefrontal regions had decreased perfusion (lateral, orbital, medial), as well as regions in inferior temporal and parietal cortex that are known to be anatomically connected. regions with increased perfusion were also identified (eg, thalamus, cerebellum, retrosplenial cingulate), which suggests an imbalance in distributed cortical and subcortical circuits.   interpretation these distributed dysfunctional circuits may form the neural basis of schizophrenia through cognitive impairment of the brain, which prevents it from processing input efficiently and producing output effectively, thereby leading to symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and loss of volition.
the molecular diagnosis of respiratory infection can be performed using different commercial multiplex-based pcr kits whose performances have been previously compared individually to those of conventional techniques. this study compared the practicability and the diagnostic performances of six ce-marked kits available in 2011 on the french market, including 2 detecting viruses and atypical bacteria (from pathofinder and seegene companies) and 4 detecting only viruses (from abbott, genomica, qiagen and seegene companies). the respective sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and agreement of each multiplex technique were calculated by comparison to commercial duplex pcr tests (argene/biomérieux) used as gold standard. eighty-eight respiratory specimens with no pathogen (n = 11), single infections (n = 33) or co-infections (n = 44) were selected to cover 9 viruses or groups of viruses and 3 atypical bacteria. all samples were extracted using the nuclisens® easymag™ instrument (biomérieux). the overall sensitivity ranged from 56.25% to 91.67% for viruses and was below 50% with both tests for bacteria. the overall specificity was excellent (>94% for all pathogens). for each tested kit, the overall agreement with the reference test was strong for viruses (kappa test >0.60) and moderate for bacteria. after the extraction step, the hands-on time varied from 50 min to 2h30 and the complete results were available in 2h30 to 9 h. the spectrum of tested agents and the technology used to reveal the pcr products as well as the laboratory organization are determinant for the selection of a kit. abstract    this study compares the performance of four commercial multiplex pcr assays (resplex ii panel v2.0, seeplex rv15, xtag rvp and xtag rvp fast) and direct fluorescent antibody (dfa) staining and viral isolation. seven hundred and fifty nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for 17 viral agents. in each assay, the sensitivity and specificity for each target were determined against a composite reference standard. two hundred and eighty-eight out of 750 (38.4%) specimens were positive by dfa or viral isolation, while an additional 214 (28.5%) were positive by multiplex pcr, for a total positivity rate of 66.9%. of 502 positive specimens, one virus was detected in 420 specimens (83.7%), two in 77 (15.3%), three in four (0.8%) and four in one case (0.2%). compared with a composite reference standard, the inter-assay accuracy of the multiplex pcr assays varied, but all were superior to conventional diagnostic methods in detecting a broad range of respiratory viral agents in children. in addition, the sensitivity of two commercial assays, resplex ii plus pre and seeplex influenza a/b subtyping, was determined relative to the astra influenza screen & type assay for detection of influenza a viruses, including seasonal influenzas and pandemic h1n1 2009 influenza a virus. using 75 positive and 55 negative nasopharyngeal swabs for influenza a by the astra assay, the sensitivity of seeplex and resplex was 95.9% and 91.8%, respectively, with a specificity of 100% for both.
health-related quality of life (hrqol) in parents of children suffering from renal disease is often diminished by the illness burden experienced in daily life and by unfavorable ways of coping. our aim was to examine the relationship between psychosocial strains perceived by parents, their ways of coping, and hrqol. in an anonymous cross-sectional study, parents completed a questionnaire concerning psychosocial strains, coping strategies, and hrqol, as well as sociodemographic and illness parameters. study participants were recruited in two outpatient dialysis centers. participating in the study were 195 parents (105 mothers, 90 fathers; age 43 ± 8 years; representing 108 families) of children suffering from renal disease (age 12 ± 5 years). parents of children with chronic renal failure reported moderate hrqol with parents of children undergoing dialysis experiencing more limitations in quality of life than parents of children living with a kidney graft and parents of children undergoing conservative treatment. mothers experienced lower hrqol and higher psychosocial strains than fathers. hrqol was predicted by the coping strategies “focusing on child” (β = –0.25), “improving marital relationship” (β = 0.24), “seeking social support” (β = –0.22) and “self-acceptation and growth” (β =0 .19) as well as parents′ perceived limitation by illness in daily life (β = –0.15; explained variance 57%). in the comprehensive care for families with a child suffering from a renal disease, screening for psychosocial strains and ways of coping, along with applying interventions to strengthen adaptive coping strategies, may be a preventative means of improving parents′ quality of life. families with a child on chronic peritoneal dialysis have to assume a significant burden of care, intensifying the demands and the reorganization of roles in the families of children. the purpose of this study is to describe the implications of role changes in families of children with chronic renal disease on peritoneal dialysis. this is a case study of four families of children with chronic renal disease on peritoneal dialysis. fourteen family members participate in the study. after the child's chronic kidney failure and the start of treatment, each relative's ways, acts and functions are changed, maintained or adapted to the new family dynamics, imposed by the child's treatment conditions. appropriate role assessment provides the nurse and the families of children with chronic renal failure on peritoneal dialysis with insight regarding current and potential health problems and aids in identifying the needs of the families.
bonded maxillary expansion appliances have been suggested to control increases in the vertical dimension of the face after rapid maxillary expansion (rme). however, there is still no consensus in the literature about its real skeletal effects. the purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate, longitudinally, the vertical and sagittal cephalometric alterations after rme performed with bonded maxillary expansion appliance. the sample consisted of 26 children, with a mean age of 8.7 years (range: 6.9-10.9 years), with posterior skeletal crossbite and indication for rme. after maxillary expansion, the bonded appliance was used as a fixed retention for 3.4 months, being replaced by a removable retention subsequently. the cephalometric study was performed onto lateral radiographs, taken before treatment was started, and again 6.3 months after removing the bonded appliance. intra-group comparison was made using paired t test. the results showed that there were no significant sagittal skeletal changes at the end of treatment. there was a small vertical skeletal increase in five of the eleven evaluated cephalometric measures. the maxilla displaced downward, but it did not modify the facial growth patterns or the direction of the mandible growth. under the specific conditions of this research, it may be concluded that rme with acrylic bonded maxillary expansion appliance did promote signifciant vertical or sagittal cephalometric alterations. the vertical changes found with the use of the bonded appliance were small and probably transitory, similar to those occurred with the use of banded expansion appliances. objective to evaluate the long-term effects of rapid maxillary expansion (rme) via banded expanders in the sagittal and vertical facial planes.   materials and methods the sample consisted of 25 patients who had undergone rme (with either haas-type or hyrax hygienic expanders) followed by standard edgewise orthodontic therapy. this sample was compared with a group of 25 patients who had edgewise treatment only and with a control nontreatment group of 26 subjects, matched by age and gender with the patients of the other two groups. lateral cephalograms were taken before treatment (t1), at the end of treatment (t2), and at 3 years posttreatment (t3), comprising a 5-year average time of observation.   results rme treatment, in the long-term, did not influence the sagittal position of the apical jaw bases or the facial vertical dimension.   conclusion unfavorable cephalometric changes resulting immediately after rme are temporary, and therefore concerns about using rme in patients with vertical growth patterns or an extremely convex facial profile are not substantiated.
previous studies evaluated the effects of psychosocial stress on influenza vaccine responses. however, there were methodological limitations. this study aims to determine whether chronic stress is associated with poorer influenza-specific immune responses to influenza vaccines in hong kong chinese elderly people. this is a prospective study with a 12-week follow-up. subjects were recruited from government general out-patient clinics, non-government organizations, and public housing estates in hong kong. participants include 55 caregivers of spouses with chronic conditions that impaired their activities of daily living and 61 age- and sex-matched non-caregivers. a single-dose trivalent influenza vaccine was given to all subjects by intramuscular ingestion. blood samples were collected before vaccination, at 6 weeks, and at 12 weeks after vaccination. influenza vaccine strain-specific antibody titers were measured by the hemagglutination inhibition method. lymphocyte subsets were analyzed for ratios and absolute counts, and cytokine concentration were measured by flow cytometry. validated scales were used to assess psychological (depressive symptoms, perceived stress, and caregiver strain), social (multidimensional social support scale), and lifestyle factors (physical exercise, cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption) at baseline prior to vaccination. demographic and socioeconomic variables were also collected. albumin levels were measured as an indicator for nutritional status in subjects. caregivers had statistically significant (p < 0.05) lower cell-mediated immune responses to influenza vaccination at 12 weeks when compared with those of the controls. no differences in humoral immune response to vaccination were observed between caregivers and controls. hong kong chinese elderly who experience chronic stress have a significantly lower cell-mediated immune response to influenza vaccination when compared with non-caregivers. to determine whether a chronic stressor (caregiving for a spouse with a progressive dementia) is associated with an impaired immune response to influenza virus vaccination, we compared 32 caregivers' vaccine responses with those of 32 sex-, age-, and socioeconomically matched control subjects. caregivers showed a poorer antibody response following vaccination relative to control subjects as assessed by two independent methods, elisa and hemagglutination inhibition. caregivers also had lower levels of in vitro virus-specific-induced interleukin 2 levels and interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6 did not differ between groups. these data demonstrate that down-regulation of the immune response to influenza virus vaccination is associated with a chronic stressor in the elderly. these results could have implications for vulnerability to infection among older adults.
summarythe effect of an imposed drinking discipline versus ad libitum drinking was studied on 21 healthy, well-trained volunteers, during a continuous 4.5-h march at an altitude of 1,700 m and an ambient temperature of 0° c, sd 1. group i (n = 13) was instructed to drink 250 ml of warmed, artificially sweetened fluid every 30 min, whereas group ii (n = 8) drank plain water ad libitum. the median fluid intake in group i was significantly higher than in group ii (p < 0.0002). serum urea and osmolality decreased during the march in group i (p < 0.05; p < 0.002, respectively) with no significant change in group ii. in both groups, a similar increase in haemoglobin concentration concomitant with a reduction in calculated blood and plasma volume was observed after exercise and did not correlate with the state of hydration. total urine volume, creatinine clearance, urea clearance and potassium excretion were significantly higher and urinary osmolality was lower in group i than in group ii (p < 0.05). these results reflect a state of extreme “voluntary dehydration” in the control group when no fluid intake was obligatory. thus, during exercise in the cold, under conditions similar to those in this study, a fluid intake of 150 ml · h−1 should be maintained in order to keep a urinary flow of about 1 ml · kg−1 · h−1 and to achieve a good state of hydration. plasma volume (pv), protein, and electrolyte shifts were measured in two groups of five men in the supine position during rest, exercise (40-47% vo2max), and recovery in cool (ta = 26.5 degrees c) and hot (ta = 39.4 degrees c) environments. they drank 16-17 ml/kg hypertonic (1.5%) nacl, isotonic (0.9%) nacl, or hypertonic (1.5%) calcium gluconate solutions during the preexercise rest period. hyper-na consumption retarded the rise in pv (hypervolemia) at rest in the cool but not in the heat. ingestion of iso-na and hyper-na resulted in twofold greater hypervolemia at rest in the heat. during exercise and recovery, pv was highest with hyper-na in the heat. hyper-ca prevented the normal hypervolemic response at rest in both environments. the normal hypervolemic responses during exercise were not influenced by any drink composition. the results suggest hypertonic drinks may be better for maintaining pv levels during exercise in heat; but calcium must be used with care.
aim we investigated whether the risk estimates of general practitioners (gps) and their treatment decisions mutually influence each other and whether factors not related to the patient's risk, such as the gender and length in clinical practice, interact.   background the quantitative assessment of the absolute risk of developing coronary heart disease (chd) and the decision to start treatment with lipid-lowering drugs are crucial tasks in the primary prevention of chd.   methods nine clinical vignettes, four rated high-risk and five rated low-risk according to the framingham equation, were mailed to three groups of 90 randomly selected gps in stockholm. one group (r) was asked to estimate the risk of chd within 10 years on a visual analogue scale. a second group (r1d) was asked to estimate the risk and to specify whether they would recommend a pharmacological lipid-lowering treatment. a third group (d) only to indicate whether they would recommend treatment.   results response rate ranged from 42.2% to 45.6%. the median risk estimates were higher in the r group than in the r1d group (difference not statistically significant). r1d group showed higher proportions of correct decisions to start treatment compared with the r group (86.2% versus 77.5%, p50.19). more correct decisions were made by female doctors (or 1.77, 95% ci 1.19-2.61, p50.004) and by less experienced doctors (or 0.97, 95% ci 0.95-0.99, p50.016).   conclusions the task of making chd risk estimates and the task of making decisions whether to start lipid-lowering treatment do not seem to influence each other. the gender of physicians and the length of clinical experience seem to affect treatment decisions. female gps and less experienced gps are more likely to make correct decisions. however, the relatively low response rate to the questionnaires may limit the generalizability of these results. the tenets of fuzzy trace theory are summarized with respect to their relevance to health and medical decision making. illustrations are given for hiv prevention, cardiovascular disease, surgical risk, genetic risk, and cancer prevention and control. a core idea of fuzzy trace theory is that people rely on the gist of information, its bottom-line meaning, as opposed to verbatim details in judgment and decision making. this idea explains why precise information (e.g., about risk) is not necessarily effective in encouraging prevention behaviors or in supporting medical decision making. people can get the facts right, and still not derive the proper meaning, which is key to informed decision making. getting the gist is not sufficient, however. retrieval (e.g., of health-related values) and processing interference brought on by thinking about nested or overlapping classes (e.g., in ratio concepts, such as probability) are also important. theory-based interventions that work (and why they work) are presented, ranging from specific techniques aimed at enhancing representation, retrieval, and processing to a comprehensive intervention that integrates these components.
the emergence of mutations in the hepatitis b virus (hbv) s gene has threatened the long‐term success of vaccination programs since the worldwide introduction of effective vaccines against hepatitis b. this study was conducted on 5,407 children (0–8 years old) in eastern china in 2007. we analyzed the prevalence of hbsag, anti‐hbs, and “a”‐determinant mutations in the hbv s gene by microparticle enzyme immunoassays, pcr, and dnastar software. the total hbsag prevalence was 1.52% (82/5,407) in the children and increased with age. in contrast, the positive rate (65.42%, 2,374/3,629) and the titers of anti‐hbs decreased with age. the predominant infection was hbv of genotype c and serotype adr (45/51; 88% of cases). mutations of i126t, amino acid 137 (nt553t deletion mutation), g145a, g145r, and f158s were found in the children; the mutations of amino acid 137 and f158s have not been reported previously. the total prevalence of mutant strains was 14% (7/51). to investigate whether the infection resulted from maternal transmission, we compared the s gene sequences in 16 mother–child pairs. fourteen mother–child pairs exhibited the same hbv genotype, with 99.5–100% sequence homology in the s gene, while two pairs exhibited different genotypes. this study suggested that the hepatitis b vaccination strategies in eastern china have been successful. although the emergence of “a”‐determinant mutations in the hbv s gene have resulted in hbv infection in immunized children, this does not pose a threat to the vaccination strategies. the hbv‐infected children had contracted the infection via vertical transmission. j. med. virol. 81:1517–1524, 2009. © 2009 wiley‐liss, inc. the long-term efficacy of hepatitis b vaccination among high-risk infants was determined in 805 vaccine responders, immunized at birth in taiwan during 1981-1984 and followed to age 10 years, via life table survival and cox multivariate analyses. at 10 years, cumulative persistence of antibody to hepatitis b surface antigen (anti-hbs) was 85%, and cumulative incidence of hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection was 15%. three children became carriers. twelve-month anti-hbs titer was the strongest predictor of efficacy. the higher the initial titer, the lower the risk of anti-hbs loss (relative risk [rr], 0.26 for titer of 100-999 miu/ml; rr, 0.08 for titer >1000 miu/ml; p<.001) and hbv infection (rr, 0.55 and 0.27; p<.05). maternal hepatitis b e antigen positivity but not hepatitis b immunoglobulin dose or gender predicted greater antibody persistence to age 10 years. because the level of antibody persistence remained high and few became carriers, booster revaccination within 10 years seems unnecessary.
selection and random genetic drift are the two main forces affecting allele frequencies in common bean breeding programs. therefore, knowledge on allele frequency changes attributable to these forces is of fundamental importance for breeders. the changes in frequencies of alleles of biochemical markers were examined in f2 to f7 populations derived from crosses between cultivated mesoamerican and andean common bean accessions (phaseolus vulgaris l.). biochemical markers included the seed proteins phaseolin, lectin and other seed polypeptides, and six isozymes. the schaffer’s test detected a high significant linear trend of the 63% of the polymorphic loci studied, meaning that directional selection was acting on those loci. associations between seed size traits, phaseolin seed-storage protein and isozyme markers were detected based on the comparisons of the progeny genotypic means. in the interracial populations the intermediate form phah/t, b6, and rbcs98 alleles had a positive effect on seed size. in the inter-gene pool populations, a higher transmission of mesoamerican alleles in all loci was showed, although the andean alleles phat, skdh100, rbcs98, and diap100 showed positive effects on seed weight. our results suggest that phaseolin and other seed proteins markers are linked to loci affecting seed size. these markers have good potential for improving the results of the selection and should be considered as a strategy for germplasm enhancement and to avoid the reduced performance of the inter-gene pool populations. neutral detergent fiber (ndf) is considered the laboratory measure most closely correlated with voluntary intake of forages by ruminant livestock. the objectives of this study were to create smooth bromegrass (bromus inermis leyss.) populations divergent for ndf concentration in four smooth bromegrass germplasm pools and to identify random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) marker changes in these divergently selected populations. two cycles of divergent phenotypic selection led to significant linear responses in ndf among selection cycles for all germplasm pools. within-population variation for rapd markers was large, reflecting the outcrossing reproduction and the complex inheritance of smooth bromegrass. however, analysis of molecular variance revealed significant genetic differences among selected populations. analysis of genetic distances showed that each cycle of selection created additional divergence, both among cycles and among germplasm pools. up to 15 rapd markers were associated with selection in each population, but only one marker was consistently associated with selection for ndf across all four germplasm pools (linear, homogeneous slopes, no drift). some of the rapd markers appear to have utility for marker selection or marker-assisted selection (mas) to modify ndf concentration.
thermoregulatory processes are induced not only by exposure to cold or heat but also by a variety of physiological situations including age, fasting and food intake that result in changes in body temperature. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the differences in serum mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (ucp1), rumen temperature (trumen) and rectal temperature (trectal) values between adult and kids goats. ten adult male maltese goats aged 3-5 years old (group a) and 30 male kids, raised for meat, were enrolled in this study. the kids were equally divided into 3 groups according to their age: group b included kids aged 3 months, group c included kids aged 4 months and group d included kids aged 5 months. blood samples and measurements of trumen and trectal were obtained from each animal. one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (anova) was applied to evaluate the effect of age on the studied parameters. statistically significant higher serum ucp1 levels (p<0.001) were found in group a as compared to groups b, c and d. higher trumen values (p<0.001) were found in group a than in groups b, c and d, and in group b than in groups c and d. group a showed lower trectal values (p<0.001) than groups b, c and d. the pearson's correlation test was applied to assess significant relationship among studied parameters showing a statistically significant negative correlation between the values of trectal and serum ucp1 in all studied groups (p<0.001). these results indicate that goats have good control of body temperature suggesting that further details about the thermogenic capacity and the function of ucp1 in kids and adult goats are worth exploring. the uncoupling protein 1 (ucp1) is an indicator of brown adipocytes and is involved in the control of body temperature and regulation of energy balance. it abundantly expresses in newborns and has important functions in adults. however, little information was known on ucp1 gene expression in young and adolescent sheep. in this study, we cloned and identified the full-length dna and cdna sequences of the ovine ucp1 gene, which were 6659 bp and 1621 bp, respectively, and predicted the location of the gene on chromosome 17. forty-eight animals with an equal number of males and females each for both guangling large tail sheep (glt) and small tail sheep han (sth) sheep were used to study the ontogenetic expression of ucp1 mrna in eight adipose tissues by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the results showed that the mrna was expressed in all tissues studied and at all stages from 2 to 12 months of age. nevertheless, the mrna in perirenal fat was expressed significantly higher than that in other tissues and lower in superficial fat than in deep deposits. the highest expression was observed in animals at 2 months of age and then decreased gradually with age. global expression in glt was significantly higher than that in sth. interactions between tissue and breed and age also influenced the mrna expression significantly. in addition, the mrna expression was associated with the single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) haplotypes detected in the cdna of the gene.
purpose to determine the unfavorable factors, related to lower pole anatomical characteristics (lpacs), influencing the success of retrograde intrarenal surgery (rirs) for lower pole renal calculi (lpc).   materials and methods we reviewed the data of 36 patients who underwent rirs for lpc between october 2012 and october 2013. the infundibulopelvic angle (ipa), infundibular length (il) and infundibular width (iw) were measured on preoperative intravenous urographies. on follow-up stone-free status was defined as complete clearance at the first month kidney-ureter-bladder x-ray and computed tomography if necessary.   results the median stone size was 10 mm (range, 5-35). the stone-free rates according to lpacs at the first month follow-up were 100% (n = 17), 57.9% (n = 11), 90% (n = 18), 62.5% (n = 10), 90.5% (n = 19) and 60% (n = 9) for patients with ipa ≥ 70°, ipa < 70º, il < 3 cm, il ≥ 3 cm, iw ≥ 5 mm and iw < 5 mm, respectively. while ipa and iw were associated with success of rirs for lpc in multivariate analysis (p = .003 and p = .046, respectively), only iw was found to be a significant factor after applying multivariate analysis (p = .05).   conclusion the results of our study demonstrated that only iw had a significant effect on the success rate of rirs for lpc. purpose percutaneous nephrolithotomy has been the standard of care for intrarenal calculi greater than 2 cm. flexible ureteroscopy with holmium laser lithotripsy is a minimally invasive treatment modality that is able to treat large intrarenal calculi with the potential to decrease morbidity, while maintaining a high level of efficacy.   materials and methods a total of 15 patients with a single intrarenal calculus 2 cm or greater were treated with retrograde ureteroscopic nephrolithotripsy. lithotripsy was performed with a 7.2fr flexible ureteroscope and 200 micron laser fiber. the stone-free rate was defined as the absence of any stones in the kidney or residual stone fragments less than 1 mm, which is too small to be extracted with a basket or a grasper. all patients underwent followup ureteroscopy within 15 days after the last procedure and renal ultrasound 30 days after the last treatment.   results there were a total of 15 intrarenal calculi 20 to 25 mm (mean 22) in diameter. the mean number of procedures was 2.3 (range 2 to 4). the overall stone-free rate was 93.3%. one patient (6.6%) had a residual 5 mm stone fragment in the lower pole of the kidney, which was followed expectantly for 2 years with no change in size. there were no major complications. there were 3 minor complications (20%), including 1 emergency room visit for fever and pain, and 2 cases of gross hematuria. all cases were performed on an outpatient basis.   conclusions in select patients with a single intrarenal calculus 2 cm or greater small diameter flexible ureteroscopy with holmium laser lithotripsy may represent an alternative therapy to standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy with acceptable efficacy and low morbidity.
orthostatic intolerance is a debilitating syndrome characterized by tachycardia on assumption of upright posture. the norepinephrine (ne) transporter (net) has been implicated in a genetic form of the disorder. we assessed the combined central and peripheral effects of pharmacological net blockade on cardiovascular regulation and baroreflex sensitivity in rats. ne reuptake was blocked chronically in female sprague-dawley rats by the net antagonist desipramine (dmi). treated animals demonstrated an elevated supine heart rate, reduced tyramine responsiveness, and a reduced plasma ratio of the intraneuronal ne metabolite dihydroxyphenylglycol relative to ne, all of which are consistent with observations in human net deficiency. spectral analysis revealed a dramatic decrease in low-frequency spectral power after dmi that was consistent with decreased sympathetic outflow. stimulation of the baroreflex with the vasodilator nitroprusside revealed an attenuated tachycardia in dmi-treated animals. this indicated that the dmi-induced sympathoinhibitory effects of increased ne in the brain stem predominates over the functional elevation of ne stimulation of peripheral targets. thus attenuated baroreflex function and reduced sympathetic outflow may contribute to the orthostatic intolerance of severe net deficiency. 1. the fluctuations that underlie the spontaneous variability of blood pressure (bp) and heart rate (hr) were investigated in conscious normotensive rats using power spectral analysis.
backgroundpneumococcal diseases in children under five years are common and preventable. in colombia there are two pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (pcv) that have proved clinical efficacy. the aim was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 13-valent pcv (pcv13) and 10-valent pcv (pcv10) in terms of prevention of invasive pneumococcal diseases (ipd), radiologically-confirmed pneumonia, and their related mortality, as well as, acute otitis media (aom) in a cohort of newborns in colombia.methodswe developed an analytical decision tree model with national data including the distribution of pneumococcal serotypes in colombia between 2009 and 2013. a simulation of vaccination of 90% of newborns in colombia took place with a time horizon of 5 years. the analysis was done from the colombian health system perspective. vaccines efficacy parameters were measured as life-years gained (lyg) and avoided morbidity by pneumococcal diseases; they were determined by a systematic review of literature. a health insurance company provided the costs. a probabilistic and a univariate sensitivity analysis for epidemiological, efficacy and cost parameters were done.resultsafter 5 years projection, pcv13 would prevent 437 deaths due to pneumococcal infections versus 321 that would be prevented by pcv10, compared to no vaccination. pcv13 would generate 25 396 lyg, and pcv10 would generate 18 708 lyg. medical costs avoided would be us$ 19 479 395 for pcv13 and us$ 13 703 271 for pcv10. compared to no vaccination, pcv13 and pcv10 were cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (icer) of us$ 489.26 and us$ 813.41 per additional lyg, respectively; besides, pcv13 was dominant over pcv10 due to lower costs and better outcomes.conclusionpcv13 is a cost-saving strategy compared with pcv10, as part of a universal coverage vaccination program in colombian children under one year. pcv13 is expected to lead to a greater decrement in infant mortality from pneumococcal diseases, and a higher cost saving by preventing more pneumococcal diseases compared with pcv10 in a 5 years projection. background heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pcv-7) was licensed to provide immunity against pneumococcal disease caused by seven serotypes of s. pneumoniae. thirteen-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (pcv-13) includes 6 additional serotypes for preventing invasive pneumococcal disease.   objective the objective of this study was to estimate the potential health benefits, costs, and cost-effectiveness of vaccination with pcv-13 in the community of valencia and to generate valuable information for policy makers at regional and country levels.   methods a decision tree was designed to determine the health and economic outcomes in hypothetical cohorts of vaccinated and unvaccinated children followed over their lifetime. information about disease incidence and serotype distribution were gathered from local databases and from published and unpublished local records. pcv-13 effectiveness was extrapolated from pcv-7 efficacy data. a 5% of herd effect and a serotype replacement of 25% were considered for the base case scenario. only direct costs were taken into account and results were expressed in terms of life-years gained (lyg) and quality adjusted life years (qaly).   results implementing a universal pcv-13 vaccination program in the community of valencia would decrease the number of hospital admitted pneumonia to less than 4571 cases while avoiding 310 cases of ipd and 82,596 cases of aom throughout the cohort lifetime. a total of 190 s. pneumoniae related deaths would be averted over the same period. total medical costs of non-vaccinating the cohort of newborns would reach up to 403,850.859€ compared to 438,762.712€ that would represent vaccinating the cohort. the incremental cost of vaccinating the children was estimated in 12,794€/lyg and 10,407€/qaly, respectively.   conclusions a universal pcv-13 vaccination program in the community of valencia would be a cost-effective intervention from the payer perspective after preventing for pneumococcal infections and for decreasing its associated mortality and morbidity.
langerin is required for the biogenesis of birbeck granules (bgs), the characteristic organelles of langerhans cells. we previously used a langerin-yfp fusion protein having a c-terminal luminal yfp tag to dynamically decipher the molecular and cellular processes which accompany the traffic of langerin. in order to elucidate the interactions of langerin with its trafficking effectors and their structural impact on the biogenesis of bgs, we generated a yfp-langerin chimera with an n-terminal, cytosolic yfp tag. this latter fusion protein induced the formation of yfp-positive large puncta. live cell imaging coupled to a fluorescence recovery after photobleaching approach showed that this coalescence of proteins in newly formed compartments was static. in contrast, the yfp-positive structures present in the pericentriolar region of cells expressing langerin-yfp chimera, displayed fluorescent recovery characteristics compatible with active membrane exchanges. using correlative light-electron microscopy we showed that the coalescent structures represented highly organized stacks of membranes with a pentalaminar architecture typical of bgs. continuities between these organelles and the rough endoplasmic reticulum allowed us to identify the stacks of membranes as a form of “organized smooth endoplasmic reticulum” (oser), with distinct molecular and physiological properties. the involvement of homotypic interactions between cytoplasmic yfp molecules was demonstrated using an a206k variant of yfp, which restored most of the langerin traffic and bg characteristics observed in langerhans cells. mutation of the carbohydrate recognition domain also blocked the formation of oser. hence, a “double-lock” mechanism governs the behavior of yfp-langerin, where asymmetric homodimerization of the yfp tag and homotypic interactions between the lectin domains of langerin molecules participate in its retention and the subsequent formation of bg-like oser. these observations confirm that bg-like structures appear wherever langerin accumulates and confirm that membrane trafficking effectors dictate their physiology and, illustrate the importance of molecular interactions in the architecture of intracellular membranes. a heterozygous mutation in the langerin gene corresponding to position 837 in the langerin mrna was identified in a person deficient in birbeck granules (bg). this mutation results in an amino acid replacement of tryptophan by arginine at position 264 in the carbohydrate recognition domain of the langerine protein. expression of mutated langerin in human fibroblasts induces tubular-like structures that are negative for bg-specific antibodies and do not resemble the characteristic structural features of bg.
cannabinoids inhibit tumor angiogenesis in mice, but the mechanism of their antiangiogenic action is still unknown. because the vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) pathway plays a critical role in tumor angiogenesis, here we studied whether cannabinoids affect it. as a first approach, cdna array analysis showed that cannabinoid administration to mice bearing s.c. gliomas lowered the expression of various vegf pathway-related genes. the use of other methods (elisa, western blotting, and confocal microscopy) provided additional evidence that cannabinoids depressed the vegf pathway by decreasing the production of vegf and the activation of vegf receptor (vegfr)-2, the most prominent vegf receptor, in cultured glioma cells and in mouse gliomas. cannabinoid-induced inhibition of vegf production and vegfr-2 activation was abrogated both in vitro and in vivo by pharmacological blockade of ceramide biosynthesis. these changes in the vegf pathway were paralleled by changes in tumor size. moreover, intratumoral administration of the cannabinoid δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol to two patients with glioblastoma multiforme (grade iv astrocytoma) decreased vegf levels and vegfr-2 activation in the tumors. because blockade of the vegf pathway constitutes one of the most promising antitumoral approaches currently available, the present findings provide a novel pharmacological target for cannabinoid-based therapies. vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) is a key regulator of physiological angiogenesis during embryogenesis, skeletal growth and reproductive functions. vegf has also been implicated in pathological angiogenesis associated with tumors, intraocular neovascular disorders and other conditions. the biological effects of vegf are mediated by two receptor tyrosine kinases (rtks), vegfr-1 and vegfr-2, which differ considerably in signaling properties. non-signaling co-receptors also modulate vegf rtk signaling. currently, several vegf inhibitors are undergoing clinical testing in several malignancies. vegf inhibition is also being tested as a strategy for the prevention of angiogenesis, vascular leakage and visual loss in age-related macular degeneration.
the effect of advance ('precue') information on short aiming movements was explored in adults, high school children, and primary school children with and without developmental coordination disorder (n=10, 14, 16, 10, respectively). reaction times in the dcd group were longer than in the other groups and were more influenced by the extent to which the precue constrained the possible action space. in contrast, reaction time did not alter as a function of precue condition in adults. children with dcd showed greater inaccuracy of response (despite the increased rt). we suggest that the different precue effects reflect differences in the relative benefits of priming an action prior to definitive information about the movement goal. the benefits are an interacting function of the task and the skill level of the individual. our experiment shows that children with dcd gain a benefit from advance preparation in simple aiming movements, highlighting their low skill levels. this result suggests that goal-directed rts may have diagnostic potential within the clinic. response times generally increase linearly with the logarithm of the number of potential stimulus–response alternatives (e.g., hick’s law). the ubiquity and theoretical importance of this generalization make exceptions particularly interesting. recently, kveraga et al. (exp brain res 146:307, 2002) added a third to the two previously known exceptions, demonstrating that saccade latencies were unaffected by stimulus–response uncertainty. they suggest that visually guided saccades are exceptional, because these movements can be automatically selected using a privileged pathway: the topographically organized regions in superior colliculus that convert spatially coded visual activity into spatially coded motor commands. we report that visually guided, aimed hand movements also are unaffected by both stimulus–response uncertainty and stimulus–response repetition. a second experiment demonstrated that this lack of an uncertainty effect persists for equiluminant stimuli. this result suggests that posterior parietal cortex is not the privileged pathway eliminating stimulus–response uncertainty for hand movements. because hand movements are not guided by mechanisms in the superior colliculus, our results cast doubt on the privileged-pathway hypothesis, at least for hand movements. instead, the absence of stimulus–response uncertainty may occur only in tasks that do not require the stimulus to be associated with a response effector and that have high stimulus–response compatibility.
five modern cultivars of winter wheat (triticum aestivum l.): yangmai16 (y16), yangmai 15 (y15), yangfumai 2 (y2), yannong 19 (y19) and jiaxing 002 (j2) were investigated to determine the impacts of elevated ozone concentration (e-o3) on photosynthesis-related parameters and the antioxidant system under fully open-air field conditions in china. the plants were exposed to e-o3 at 1.5 times the ambient ozone concentration (a-o3) from the initiation of tillering to final harvest. pigments, gas exchange rates, chlorophyll a fluorescence, antioxidants contents, antioxidative enzyme activity and lipid oxidation were measured in three replicated plots throughout flag leaf development. results showed that significant o3 effects on most variables were only found during the mid-grain filling stage. across five cultivars, e-o3 significantly accelerated leaf senescence, as indicated by increased lipid oxidation as well as faster declines in pigment amounts and photosynthetic rates. the lower photosynthetic rates were mainly due to non-stomatal factors, e.g. lower maximum carboxylation capacity and electron transport rates. there were strong interactions between o3 and cultivar in photosynthetic pigments, light-saturated photosynthesis rate and chlorophyll a fluorescence with o3-sensitive (y19, y2 and y15) and o3-tolerant (j2, y16) cultivars being clearly differentiated in their responses to e-o3. e-o3 significantly influenced the antioxidative enzymes but not antioxidant contents. significant interactions between o3 and cultivar were found in antioxidative enzymes, such as sod and cat, but not in stomatal conductance (gs). therefore, it can be concluded that antioxidative enzymes rather than gs or antioxidants are responsible for the differential responses to e-o3 among cultivars. these findings provide important information for the development of accurate modeling o3 effects on crops, especially with respect to the developmental stage when o3 damage to photosynthesis becomes manifest. we present a comment about "ozone risk assessment for plants: central role of metabolism-dependent changes in reducing power" by dizengremel, le thiec, bagard, and jolivet. as tools for summarizing plant o(3) sensitivity in simple indices, dizengremel et al. suggest: reducing power, as antioxidant regeneration through the halliwell/asada cycle requires nadph from the photosynthetic light reaction; rubisco/pepc ratio, as an index of the energy balance between anabolic and catabolic reactions; and water-use efficiency as a time-integrated approximation of the carbon gain to stomatal o(3) uptake ratio. the scientific background is solid, and simple enough (although expensive) to be translated into modelling and routine use. in the last decade, several approaches have been developed, mostly by using photosynthesis as a metric of defence. all these approaches should be experimentally tested in different and realistic conditions, before the results are transferred to the field and used in effective o(3) flux modelling and assessment.
introduction: itch is the main symptom in many skin diseases with a significant impact on the quality of life, while it is affected by psychological factors itself. this research aimed to investigate the changes in perception of itching in chronic skin diseases by personality characteristics, anxiety, and depression. â materials and methods: in study,200 patients diagnosed with psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and chronic urticaria referred to phototherapy unit or dermatology clinics of imam reza and ghaem hospitals in mashhad during the summer and autumn of 2014 were selected through random sampling. participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria and gave consent to participate in the study. they answered to d-type personality questionnaire, self-consciousness scale, and hospital anxiety and depression scales. in order to assess perception of itching, visual analog scale and quality of life in patients with pruritus questionnaire (itchy qol) were used. after data collection, data were analyzed using spss version 16, pearson correlation and multiple regression analysis. â results: the findings suggest that personality characteristics and psychological distress in total can explain 70.5 of the variance of itch perception. depression (p<0.0001), negative mood (p<0.0001), public awareness (p<0.004), and social inhibition (p<0.009) had the largest share in this regard. â conclusion: personality characteristics, anxiety, and depression can affect perception of itching. â pruritus and psyche are intricately and reciprocally related, with psychophysiological evidence and psychopathological explanations helping us to understand their complex association. their interaction may be conceptualized and classified into 3 groups: pruritic diseases with psychiatric sequelae, pruritic diseases aggravated by psychosocial factors, and psychiatric disorders causing pruritus. management of chronic pruritus is directed at treating the underlying causes and adopting a multidisciplinary approach to address the dermatologic, somatosensory, cognitive, and emotional aspects. pharmcotherapeutic agents that are useful for chronic pruritus with comorbid depression and/or anxiety comprise selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, mirtazapine, tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline and doxepin), and anticonvulsants (gabapentin, pregabalin); the role of neurokinin receptor-1 antagonists awaits verification. antipsychotics are required for treating itch and formication associated with schizophrenia and delusion of parasitosis (including morgellons disease).
our study aims to assess the prevalence of behavioural addictions in an adolescent population, evaluating the effects of gender and age, and to assess the correlations among different behavioural addictions. 2853 high school students were assessed in order to evaluate the prevalence of behavioural addictions such as pathological gambling (pg), compulsive buying (cb), exercise addiction (ea), internet addiction (ia), and work addiction (wa), in a population of italian adolescents. the south oaks gambling screen-revised adolescent (sogs-ra), the compulsive buying scale (cbs), the exercise addiction inventory (eai), the internet addiction test (iat), and the work addiction risk test (wart), were compiled anonymously by the students. overall prevalence was 7.0% for pg, 11.3% for cb, 1.2% for ia, 7.6% for wa, 8.5% for ea. pg and ea were more common among boys, while gender had no effect on the other conditions. cb was more common among younger (<18 years old) students. the scores of all of these scales were significantly correlated. the strong correlation among different addictive behaviours is in line with the hypothesis of a common psychopathological dimension underlying these phenomena. further studies are needed to assess personality traits and other clinical disorders associated with these problems behaviours. abstract objective taking into account the importance of act prevention on the development of addictions, we assessed the presence of multiple addictions in an adolescent high-school population, also assessing the prevalence of internet abuse and the impact on disability. introduction adolescence seems to be a critical period of addiction vulnerability, based on social but also neurobiological factors.the earlier onset of behavioral/substance dependence seems to predict greater addiction severity, morbidity, and multiple addictive disorders. methods data were collected from a sample of 275 students in florence, italy, high schools through surveys distributed in classes. the sample had an average age of 16.67±1.85 years (52.4% males, 47.6% females). to assess multiple addiction we used the 16 subscales of the shorter promis questionnaire, to assess internet addiction prevalence we used the internet addiction scale, and to quantify disability symptoms, we used the sheehan disability scale. results caffeine abuse, sex, relationship submissive, gambling, food starving, and food bingeing have raised highest scores. 5.4% of the students were found to be internet addicted similar to other countries. disability seemed strongly correlated to the subscale of alcohol, gambling, sex, tobacco, food starving and food bingeing, shopping, exercise, and internet addiction. gambling, sex, caffeine abuse, compulsive help dominant, work, internet addiction, relationship dominant, and relationship submissive in this sample were strongly related to substance dependence. conclusion level of concerns unexpected compared to the level reported in other countries for the behavioral compulsions, have been highlighted. behavioral addictions are multiple, a source of disability, and they are related to substance abuse. it has yet to be clarified if they are a temporary phenomenon occurring in adolescents or if they are a stable trait, accounting as marker for the development of substance abuse.
backgroundengagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors, such as healthy diet and regular physical activity, are known to reduce the risk of developing coronary heart disease (chd). complementary and alternative medicine (cam) is known to be associated with having a healthy lifestyle. the primary aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and predictors of cam use in chd patients, and in those without chd but at risk for developing chd, using protection motivation theory (pmt) as a guiding conceptual framework.methodquestionnaire data were collected from 12,981 adult participants in the cross-sectional sixth tromsø study (2007–8). eligible for analyses were 11,103 participants who reported whether they had used cam or not. of those, 830 participants reported to have or have had chd (chd group), 4830 reported to have parents, children or siblings with chd (no chd but family risk), while 5443 reported no chd nor family risk of chd. we first compared the patterns of cam use in each group, and then examined the pmt predictors of cam use. health vulnerability from the threat appraisal process of pmt was assessed by self-rated health and expectations for future health. response efficacy from the coping appraisal process of pmt was assessed as preventive health beliefs and health behavior frequency.resultsuse of cam was most commonly seen in people with no chd themselves, but family risk of developing chd (35.8%), compared to people already diagnosed with chd (30.2%) and people with no chd nor family risk (32.1%). all four of the pmt factors; self-rated health, expectations for future health, preventive health beliefs, and the health behavior index – were predictors for cam use in the no chd but family risk group.conclusionthese findings suggest that people use cam in response to a perceived risk of developing chd, and to prevent disease and to maintain health. objective the focus of this study was to examine the patterns of provider-based complementary and alternative medicine (cam) use across three chronic illness groups, and to identify the socio-demographic, health-related, and psychosocial factors associated with cam use.   design cross-sectional international survey administered on the internet to individuals with arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), and mixed chronic conditions.   main outcome measures self-reported consultations to cam providers and to a variety of conventional health-care services made in the previous 6 months.   results 365 surveys were received from people with arthritis (n=140), ibd (n=110), and other chronic conditions (n=115). overall 38.1% of respondents had used cam, with rates ranging from 31.8 to 46.1% across the three illness groups. backward step-wise logistic regression revealed that being female, having more than high school education, a greater number of comorbid conditions, higher perceived control over health and reward motivations, lower stress and less belief that health is governed by chance, were the best predictors of cam consultations. cam clients also used a greater variety of conventional health-care services and made more consultations relative to non-cam clients.   conclusions in this study the socio-demographic and health status factors associated with cam consultations in three different chronic illness groups were similar to those found in the general population. cam use in the study population was also related to higher use and a greater variety of use of conventional health-care services, and with stronger beliefs in the controllability of health and an enduring motivation to seek out rewards.
aim: hydrogen sulfide (h2s) is a newly‐introduced gasotransmitter in penile tissues. however, its exact mechanism of action in mediating penile erection is not fully elucidated. the major aim of this study was to examine the role of different k+ channels in mediating the responses to h2s in the corpus cavernosum. main methods: tension studies using isolated rat corpus cavernosum strips were conducted. endogenous h2s production was measured using polarographic technique. results are expressed as mean ± sem. key findings: l‐cysteine (10− 2 m) stimulated rat corpus cavernosum to produce h2s. blockade of cse by bca (10− 3 m) reduced the concentration of h2s produced from rat corpus cavernosum significantly. addition of tea (10− 2 m) or 4‐ap (10− 3 m) didn't have a significant effect on the concentration of h2s produced. l‐cysteine (10− 6–10− 2 m) elicited a concentration‐dependent relaxation response which was significantly reduced by blockade of cse using bca (10− 3 m). tea (10− 2 m), 4‐ap (10− 3 m) and tea (10− 4 m) attenuated l‐cysteine‐induced relaxation significantly. at 10− 4 m, l‐cysteine resulted in percentage relaxation of 1.55 ± 0.63, 10.94 ± 1.93 and 1.93 ± 0.80 in presence of tea (10− 2 m), 4‐ap (10− 3 m) and tea (10− 4 m) respectively compared to 23.78 ± 2.71 as control. both glibenclamide (10− 5 m) and bacl2 (3 × 10− 5 m) failed to reduce these relaxations significantly. significance: h2s‐induced relaxation of rat corpus cavernosum may be mediated ‐ at least in part ‐ through bkca and kv channels not by katp and kir channels. it also seems that k+‐channels do not contribute to the synthesis of h2s. the relaxant effect of hydrogen sulfide (h(2)s) in the vascular tree is well established but its influence and mechanism of action in gastrointestinal smooth muscle was hardly investigated. the influence of h(2)s on contractility in mouse gastric fundus was therefore examined. sodium hydrogen sulfide (nahs; h(2)s donor) was administered to prostaglandin f(2alpha) (pgf(2alpha))-contracted circular muscle strips of mouse gastric fundus, before and after incubation with interfering drugs. nahs caused a concentration-dependent relaxation of the pre-contracted mouse gastric fundus strips. the k(+) channels blockers glibenclamide, apamin, charybdotoxin, 4-aminopyridin and barium chloride had no influence on the nahs-induced relaxation. the relaxation by nahs was also not influenced by l-name, odq and sq 22536, inhibitors of the cgmp and camp pathway, by nerve blockers capsazepine, omega-conotoxin and tetrodotoxin or by several channel and receptor blockers (ouabain, nifedipine, 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate, ryanodine and thapsigargin). the myosin light chain phosphatase (mlcp) inhibitor calyculin-a reduced the nahs-induced relaxation, but the rho-kinase inhibitor y-27632 had no influence. we show that nahs is able to relax pgf(2alpha)-contracted mouse gastric fundus strips. the results suggest that in the mouse gastric fundus, h(2)s causes relaxation at least partially via activation of mlcp.
agricultural intensification caused a fragmentation of flower-rich extensively used meadows which resulted in the reduction of the abundance of species of these habitats. the abundance pattern and the dispersal behaviour of species influence the connectivity of local populations. in this context exchange rates can be directly measured by mark release recapture (mrr) studies and indirectly by genetic analysis. both approaches are used in our study in a comparative way. as a test species to investigate the influence of habitat interconnectivity on a local and regional scale, we selected the butterfly melanargia galathea (lepidoptera, nymphalidae), a widely distributed species, which is common on flower-rich meadows in our study area in western germany. we marked 3,175 individuals of four neighbouring sites in a mark-release-recapture study and analysed 18 allozyme loci for 644 individuals sampled over 17 sites. only 3.3% of the total genetic variance was found among samples, thus supporting the detected between-patch movements. both approaches revealed a high exchange rate among local populations. moderate between- and high within-patch movements were recorded by mrr analysis, dependent on the geographical distance. the two analytical tools showed high estimated effective population sizes for all populations. in the light of conservation biology, the combination of the mrr and allozyme data support the assumption that high dispersal ability and habitat interconnectivity countervail genetic differentiation and enable the maintenance of a high level of genetic differentiation. many studies aim at testing the impact of recent fragmentation on the genetic diversity and connectivity of populations, while some species do exist naturally in fragmented landscapes because of their habitat requirements. therefore, it is important to look at the genetic signatures of species occurring in naturally fragmented landscapes in order to disentangle the effect of fragmentation from the effect of habitat requirements. we selected two nymphalid butterflies for this purpose. while melanargia galathea is a common butterfly in flower-rich meadows, melitaea aurelia is closely connected to calcareous grasslands, thus being historically fragmented due to its ecological demands. for the analysis of the genetic response on these opposed patterns, we analysed 18 allozyme loci for 789 individuals (399 individuals of m. galathea and 390 individuals of m. aurelia) in a western german study region with adjacent areas in luxemburg and northeastern france. both species showed similarly low genetic differentiations among local populations (m. galathea: fst 3.3%; m. aurelia: fst 3.6%), both combined with a moderate level of inbreeding. isolation-by-distance analysis revealed a significant correlation for both species with similar amounts of explained variances (m. galathea: r2 = 27.8%; m. aurelia: r2 = 28.5%). most parameters of genetic diversity were higher in m. galathea than in m. aurelia, but the latter species had a considerably higher amount of rare or locally restricted genes; the differing ecological demands are thus reflected in these differences. both species thus seem to be genetically well suited to their respective ecological requirements. in the light of conservation genetics, we deduce that highly fragmented populations are not necessarily prone to extinction. the extinction risk might be linked to the life history of an organism and its population genetic structure.
objectives: to assess the prevalence and levels of burnout syndrome among medical students at the universidade federal de sergipe-brazil and to identify associated factors. methods: a cross-sectional study was performed with randomly selected students in 2009. the maslach burnout inventory/student survey (mbi-ss) and a structured questionnaire on socio-demographic characteristics, the educational process, and individual aspects were used. statistical evaluation of multiple variables was performed through backward stepwise logistic regression analysis. results: the prevalence of burnout was 10.3% (n = 369). the prevalence was higher among those who did not have confidence in their clinical skills (odds ratio–or = 6.47), those who felt uncomfortable with course activities (or = 5.76), and those who did not see the coursework as a source of pleasure (or = 4.68). conclusion: there was a significant prevalence of burnout among the medical students studied. three variables, in particular, were associated with burnout and were directly related to the medical education process. preventive and intervention measures must be adopted, and longitudinal studies should be conducted. purpose burnout, a marker of professional distress prevalent among residents and physicians, has been speculated to originate in medical school. little is known about burnout in medical students. the authors sought to identify the prevalence of burnout, variation of its prevalence during medical school, and the impact of personal life events on burnout and other types of student distress. method all medical students (n = 1,098) attending the three medical schools in minnesota were surveyed in spring 2004 using validated instruments to assess burnout, quality of life, depression, and alcohol use. students were also asked about the prevalence of positive and negative personal life events in the previous 12 months. results a total of 545 medical students (response rate 50%) completed the survey. burnout was present in 239 (45%) of medical students. while the frequency of a positive depression screen and at-risk alcohol use decreased among more senior students, the frequency of burnout increased (all p < .03). the number of negative personal life events in the last 12 months also correlated with the risk of burnout (p = .0160). personal life events demonstrated a stronger relationship to burnout than did year in training on multivariate analysis. conclusions burnout appears common among u.s. medical students and may increase by year of schooling. despite the notion that burnout is primarily linked to work-related stress, personal life events also demonstrated a strong relationship to professional burnout. the authors' findings suggest both personal and curricular factors are related to burnout among medical students. efforts to decrease burnout must address both of these elements.
we present a general framework for verifying programs with complex dynamic linked data structures whose correctness depends on ordering relations between stored data values. the underlying formalism of our framework is that of forest automata (fa), which has previously been developed for verification of heap-manipulating programs. we extend fa by constraints between data elements associated with nodes of the heaps represented by fa, and we present extended versions of all operations needed for using the extended fa in a fullyautomated verification approach, based on abstract interpretation. we have implemented our approach as an extension of the forester tool and successfully applied it to a number of programs dealing with data structures such as various forms of singlyand doubly-linked lists, binary search trees, as well as skip lists. note: mpi-i-2006-2-1 (max-planck institute for computer science) reference lara-report-2006-002 url: http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.pl/0609104 record created on 2007-08-21, modified on 2017-05-12
objective the aim of this study was to investigate psychological stress in parents of children with esophageal atresia and to explore factors associated with the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd). design self-report questionnaires were administered to parents of children with ea. domains included: (1) sociodemographic data, current personal difficulties, assessment scales for the quality of life and for the global health status of the child (2) french-validated versions of the perinatal posttraumatic stress disorder questionnaire and of the state-trait anxiety inventory. associations between ptsd and severity of the neonatal course, presence of severe sequelae at 2 years of age, and quality of life and global health status of children according to their parents’ perception were studied. setting a tertiary care university hospital results among 64 eligible families, 54 parents of 38 children (59%) participated to the study. ptsd was present in 32 (59%) parents; mothers were more frequently affected than fathers (69 vs 46%, p = 0.03). four mothers (8%) had severe anxiety. ptsd was neither associated with neonatal severity nor with severe sequelae at 2 years. parents with ptsd rated their child’s quality of life and global health status significantly lower (7.5 vs 8.6; p = 0.01 and 7.4 vs 8.3; p = 0.02 respectively). conclusions ptsd is frequent in parents of children with esophageal atresia, independently of neonatal severity and presence of severe sequelae at 2 years of age. our results highlight the need for a long-term psychological support of families. aim: to study the prevalence of posttraumatic stress in parents after an acute admission to a paediatric intensive care unit (picu) and to determine risk factors for the development of posttraumatic stress.
the three-dimensional structure and backbone dynamics of a truncated and multiply substituted recombinant human interleukin-3 (il-3) variant (sc-65369) have been determined from multidimensional heteronuclear nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic data. sequential application of distance geometry and restrained molecular dynamics calculations produced a family of 25 convergent structures which satisfy a total of 1812 experimental constraints (1659 proton-proton noes, 75 backbone dihedral angle constraints, and 39 pairs of hydrogen bond constraints) with an average root-mean-square deviation from the mean coordinate positions of 0.88(+/- 0.15) angstroms and 1.37(+/- 0.13) angstroms for the backbone and all heavy atoms, respectively, of all residues except 28 to 39. the structure is a left-handed four-helix bundle (comprised of helices a through d) with two long overhand loops (designated as loops ab and cd). loop ab contains a short fifth helix (helix a') which is closely packed against helix d in an approximately parallel fashion and which has multiple contacts with loop cd. the overall molecular tumbling time (6.5 ns) determined from the 15n relaxation data was consistent with a monomeric protein under the conditions of the experiment (1 mm protein, ph 4.6, 30 degrees c). the 15n relaxation data indicate that the helical regions of sc-65369 are quite rigid, while portions of loop ab, loop cd, and the c terminus undergo significant internal motions. among the structurally related four-helical bundle cytokines, the structure of sc-65369 is most similar to those of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (gm-csf) and the single structural domain of interleukin-5 (il-5), all of which share a common receptor subunit required for signal transduction and activation of their hematopoietic target cells. indeed, the c(alpha) atoms in the four-helix core of these three proteins can be superimposed to 1.71 angstroms (sc-65369 and gm-csf, 62 c(alpha) atoms) and 1.96 angstroms (sc-65369 and il-5 single structural domain, 58 c(alpha) atoms), respectively. when the structures of the il-3 variant, gm-csf, and il-5 were aligned, the conserved and conservatively substituted residues were found to be hydrophobic and buried, with the single exception of glu-22 (il-3 numbering), which is strictly conserved but nonetheless fully exposed to solvent. the most remarkable differences between the sc-65369 structure and that of gm-csf occur in loop ab. this loop in gm-csf crosses over the top of helix d and passes underneath loop cd on its way to helix b. in contrast, loop ab of sc-65369 passes in front of helix d, similar to the first crossover loop in human growth hormone and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. in addition, helix a', which is interdigitated into the helical bundle in a manner similar to the helices in the cd loop of interferon-beta and interferon-gamma, exists in a region where short stretches of beta-structure are found at analogous positions in gm-csf and il-5. these differences suggest that the structural elements within this region may be important for recognition by their cognate receptors. human interleukin 4 (il-4) has been studied by 2d and 3d nmr techniques using uniformly 15n-labeled recombinant protein. assignment of resonances for all but 3 of the 130 residues of the recombinant protein has been achieved, enabling the secondary structure of the protein to be defined. this consists of four major alpha-helical regions and one short section of double-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet. analysis of distance and angle restraints derived from nmr experiments has enabled the overall molecular topology to be determined. this is related to that found for other four-helix proteins but has several distinctive features including cross-linking of helices by means of three disulfide bonds and a short section of beta-sheet. the structural analysis gives support to the hypothesis that many helical cytokines have a common fold and provides a basis for understanding the biological function of il-4.
purpose the purpose of this study is to attempt to characterize patients with unfavorable clinical outcome by the relative mrna levels of abc transporter expression in their tumor samples and to examine whether relative mrna levels of each of the abc transporters can be a useful predictor of progression-free survival in advanced ovarian carcinoma.   experimental design we examined tumor samples taken from 30 patients with primary serous papillary adenocarcinoma of the ovary for the expression of mdr1 and mrp1, mrp2, and mrp3 mrna by using real-time reverse transcription-pcr, and we evaluated its correlation with clinical outcome. all 30 patients were divided into three groups according to clinical outcome after debulking surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy: 8 patients were classified into the unfavorable group; 11 were classified into the favorable group; and 11 were classified into intermediate group.   results the relative mrna levels of mrp1 and mrp3 were significantly different among the three groups, and the mrna levels of mrp1 and mrp3 in the unfavorable group were significantly higher than those in the favorable group by multiple comparison. the relative mrna levels of mrp1 expression were significantly correlated with those of mrp3 expression. in the 30 patients with serous papillary adenocarcinoma, univariate and multivariate analysis demonstrated that the high relative mrna levels of mrp1 expression were significantly correlated with a short period of progression-free survival.   conclusions in patients with advanced ovarian serous papillary adenocarcinoma, these results suggest that patients with an unfavorable clinical outcome are characterized by increased levels of coordinated mrp1 and mrp3 mrna expression in their tumor samples. furthermore, a higher level of mrp1 mrna expression can be a candidate for a useful predictor of a shorter period of progression-free survival. expression of the human mdr1 gene has been shown to confer the multidrug resistance (mdr) phenotype to sensitive cells. to investigate the possible contribution of the mdr phenotype to chemoresistance in ovarian carcinoma, we have analyzed mdr1 gene expression in fresh carcinoma specimens from 50 patients. fifteen received chemotherapy before surgery and were judged as poor responders. thirty-five patients did not receive any drug before surgery. control tissues were lymphocytes from 7 patients. total rnas were analyzed by northern and slot blot hybridization techniques using human mdr1 complementary dna and human gamma-actin complementary dna probes sequentially as qualitative and quantitative controls. mdr1 transcripts (4.5 kilobases) were observed in the rna preparations obtained from 3 of 10 patients who were treated with doxorubicin or vincristine, 2 drugs known to select the mdr phenotype in vitro. in 40 other rna preparations obtained from 35 untreated patients and 5 patients treated exclusively with cyclophosphamide and cis-platinum, no transcript could be detected. using the exact fisher test, the difference between the 2 groups was found to be significant (p less than 0.01). the three tumors with elevated mdr1 expression did not show mdr1 dna amplification. our study suggests that, in spite of the weak occurrence of the mdr process in patients with ovarian cancers, mdr1 expression can be related to previous treatment with doxorubicin or vincristine. these results favor the expression of the mdr1 gene as one of the determinants involved in the acquired chemoresistance of ovarian cancers.
abstract transforming growth factor (tgf) β and its receptors are expressed at the conceptus-maternal interface during early pregnancy in the pig. the present studies were conducted to examine: (1) the effect of conceptus products on tgfβ1 mrna expression and protein concentration in the porcine endometrium using in vivo and in vitro models, and (2) the effect of tgfβ1 on proliferation of porcine trophoblast cells in vitro. during in vivo experiments, gilts with one surgically detached uterine horn were slaughtered on days 11 or 14 of the estrous cycle and pregnancy. for in vitro studies, endometrial explants and luminal epithelial (le) cells co-cultured with stromal (st) cells were treated with conceptus-exposed medium (cem). moreover, porcine trophoblast cells were treated with tgfβ1, and the number of viable cells was measured. on day 11, the presence of conceptuses had no effect on tgfβ1 mrna expression, but decreased the tgfβ1 protein concentration in the connected uterine horn compared with the detached uterine horn. in contrast to day 11, on day 14 after estrus, tgfβ1 mrna expression and protein content in the endometrium collected from the gravid uterine horn were greater when compared with the contralateral uterine horn. the treatment of endometrial slices with cem resulted in greater tgfβ1 mrna expression and protein secretion. le cells responded to cem with an increased tgfβ1 mrna level. moreover, tgfβ1 stimulated the proliferation of day 14 trophoblast cells. in summary, porcine conceptuses may regulate tgfβ1 synthesis in the endometrium at the time of implantation. tgfβ1, in turn, may promote conceptus development by increasing the proliferation of trophoblast cells. we examined the localization of transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta in first-trimester and term human decidua and chorionic villi and explored the role of this factor on the proliferation and differentiation of cultured trophoblast cells. two antibodies, 1d11.16.8, a mouse monoclonal neutralizing antibody capable of recognizing both tgf-beta 1 and tgf-beta 2 and cl-b1/29, a rabbit polyclonal antibody capable of recognizing tgf-beta 2, were used to immunolocalize tgf-beta in fixed, paraffin-embedded, or fixed, frozen sections of placenta and decidua, providing similar results. intense labeling was observed in the extracellular matrix (ecm) of the first-trimester decidua and cytoplasm of term decidual cells. syncytiotrophoblast cell cytoplasm as well as the ecm in the core of the chorionic villi of both first-trimester and term placentas exhibited a moderate degree of labeling. strong cytoplasmic labeling was observed in the cytotrophoblastic shell of the term placenta. to examine the role of tgf-beta on trophoblast proliferation and differentiation, early passage cultures of first-trimester and primary cultures of term trophoblast cells were established and characterized on the basis of numerous immunocytochemical and functional markers. these cells expressed cytokeratin, placental alkaline phosphatase, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and pregnancy-specific beta glycoprotein, but not factor viii or 63d3; they also produced hcg and collagenase type iv. exposure of first-trimester trophoblast cultures to tgf-beta 1 significantly inhibited proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. an antiproliferative effect was also noted in the presence of tgf-beta 2. these effects were abrogated in the presence of the neutralizing anti-tgf-beta antibody (1d11.16.8) in a concentration-dependent manner. in a 3-day culture, exogenous tgf-beta 1 stimulated formation of multinucleated cells by the first trimester as well as term trophoblast cells. addition of neutralizing anti-tgf-beta antibody to first-trimester trophoblast cells stimulated proliferation beyond control levels in a 24-h culture and reduced formation of multinucleated cells in a 3-day culture, indicating the presence of endogenous tgf-beta activity. these results indicate that tgf-beta produced at the human fetal-maternal interface plays a major regulatory role in the proliferation and differentiation of the trophoblast.
the thalassemias are the most common single gene disorder in the world. nowadays, the average life expectancy of patients in developed countries has increased significantly, while, there was an increase of complications. we aimed to investigate peripheral neuropathy and myopathy in this patient group using a neurophysiological study. we performed nerve conduction studies and electromyography of upper and lower extremities on 36 beta-thalassemia major (β-thal) patients. the electrophysiological findings were correlated with demographic data and laboratory parameters of the disease. patients with β-thal present polyneuropathy or myopathy at (50%). polyneuropathy was detected in (38.9%) and myopathy in (27.8%), while polyneuropathy and myopathy were present at (16.7%) with an overlap of the diseases in 1/3 of the patients. there was not a statistically significant correlation of polyneuropathy and myopathy with age, sex, splenectomy, nor with respect to laboratory parameters, hemoglobin, and ferritin. however, there was a statistically significant correlation of polyneuropathy and myopathy with iron overload, as recorded by the magnetic resonance imaging (mri) of the heart and the liver. our findings suggest that iron overload plays a key role in the pathogenesis of polyneuropathy and myopathy in β-thal patients, and performing heart and liver mri for the prediction of such lesions in an annual basis is warranted. thalassemia is a common genetic disorder in tunisia. early iron concentration assessment is a crucial and challenging issue. most of annual deaths due to iron overload occurred in underdeveloped regions of the world. limited access to liver and heart mri monitoring might partially explain these poor prognostic results. standard software programs are not available in tunisia. this study is the first to evaluate iron overload in heart and liver using the mri t2* with excel spreadsheet for post processing. association of this mri tool results to serum ferritin level, and echocardiography was also investigated. one hundred tunisian-transfused thalassemia patients older than 10 years (16.1 ± 5.2) were enrolled in the study. the mean myocardial iron concentration (mic) was 1.26 ± 1.65 mg/g dw (0.06–8.32). cardiac t2* (ct2*) was under 20 ms in 30 % of patients and under 10 ms in 21 % of patients. left ventricular ejection function was significantly lower in patients with ct2* <10 ms. abnormal liver iron concentration (lic >3 mg/g dw) was found in 95 % of patients. lic was over 15 mg/g dw in 25 % of patients. mic was more correlated than ct2* to lic and serum ferritin. among patients with sf <1000 μg/l, 13 % had ct2* <20 ms. our data showed that 30 % of the tunisian thalassemia major patients enrolled in this cohort had myocardial iron overload despite being treated by iron chelators. sf could not reliably predict iron overload in all thalassemia patients. mri t2* using excel spreadsheet for routine follow-up of iron overload might improve the prognosis of thalassemia major patients in developing countries, such as tunisia, where standard mri tools are not available or expensive.
the objective of the study was to assess the psychometric properties of the freiburg mindfulness inventory (fmi-14) using a rasch model approach in a cross-sectional design. the scale was administered to n = 130 british patients with different psychosomatic conditions. the scale failed to show clear one-factoriality and item 13 did not fit the rasch model. a two-factorial solution without item 13, however, appeared to fit well. the scale seemed to work equally well in different subgroups such as patients with or without mindfulness practice. however, some limitations of the validity of both the one-factorial and the two-factorial version of the scale were observed. sizeable floor and ceiling effects limit the diagnostical use of the instrument. in summary, the study demonstrates that the two-factorial version of the fmi-13 shows acceptable approximation to rasch requirements, but is in need of further improvement. the one-factorial solution did not fit well, and cannot be recommended for further use. mindfulness is an attribute of consciousness long believed to promote well-being. this research provides a theoretical and empirical examination of the role of mindfulness in psychological well-being. the development and psychometric properties of the dispositional mindful attention awareness scale (maas) are described. correlational, quasi-experimental, and laboratory studies then show that the maas measures a unique quality of consciousness that is related to a variety of well-being constructs, that differentiates mindfulness practitioners from others, and that is associated with enhanced self-awareness. an experience-sampling study shows that both dispositional and state mindfulness predict self-regulated behavior and positive emotional states. finally, a clinical intervention study with cancer patients demonstrates that increases in mindfulness over time relate to declines in mood disturbance and stress.
a populus deltoides × populus trichocarpa f1 pedigree was analyzed for quantitative trait loci (qtls) affecting ectomycorrhizal development and for microarray characterization of gene networks involved in this symbiosis. a 300 genotype progeny set was evaluated for its ability to form ectomycorrhiza with the basidiomycete laccaria bicolor. the percentage of mycorrhizal root tips was determined on the root systems of all 300 progeny and their two parents. qtl analysis identified four significant qtls, one on the p. deltoides and three on the p. trichocarpa genetic maps. these qtls were aligned to the p. trichocarpa genome and each contained several megabases and encompass numerous genes. nimblegen whole-genome microarray, using cdna from rna extracts of ectomycorrhizal root tips from the parental genotypes p. trichocarpa and p. deltoides, was used to narrow the candidate gene list. among the 1,543 differentially expressed genes (p value ≤ 0.05; ≥5.0-fold change in transcript level) having different transcript levels in mycorrhiza of the two parents, 41 transcripts were located in the qtl intervals: 20 in myc_d1, 14 in myc_t1, and seven in myc_t2, while no significant differences among transcripts were found in myc_t3. among these 41 transcripts, 25 were overrepresented in p. deltoides relative to p. trichocarpa; 16 were overrepresented in p. trichocarpa. the transcript showing the highest overrepresentation in p. trichocarpa mycorrhiza libraries compared to p. deltoides mycorrhiza codes for an ethylene-sensitive erebp-4 protein which may repress defense mechanisms in p. trichocarpa while the highest overrepresented transcripts in p. deltoides code for proteins/genes typically associated with pathogen resistance. truffles are symbiotic fungi that form ectomycorrhizas with plant roots. here we present evidence that at an early stage of the interaction, i.e. prior to physical contact, mycelia of the white truffle tuber borchii and the black truffle tuber melanopsorum induce alterations in root morphology of the host cistus incanus and the nonhost arabidopsis (arabidopsis thaliana; i.e. primary root shortening, lateral root formation, root hair stimulation). this was most likely due to the production of indole-3-acetic acid (iaa) and ethylene by the mycelium. application of a mixture of the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid and iaa fully mimicked the root morphology induced by the mycelium for both host and nonhost plants. application of the single hormones only partially mimicked it. furthermore, primary root growth was not inhibited in the arabidopsis auxin transport mutant aux1-7 by truffle metabolites while root branching was less effected in the ethylene-insensitive mutant ein2-lh. the double mutant aux1-7;ein2-lh displayed reduced sensitivity to fungus-induced primary root shortening and branching. in agreement with the signaling nature of truffle metabolites, increased expression of the auxin response reporter dr5∷gfp in arabidopsis root meristems subjected to the mycelium could be observed, confirming that truffles modify the endogenous hormonal balance of plants. last, we demonstrate that truffles synthesize ethylene from l-methionine probably through the α-keto-γ-(methylthio)butyric acid pathway. taken together, these results establish the central role of iaa and ethylene as signal molecules in truffle/plant interactions.
the unfolded protein response (upr) is a homeostatic mechanism to maintain endoplasmic reticulum (er) function. the upr is activated by various physiological conditions as well as in disease states, such as cancer. as androgens regulate secretion and development of the normal prostate and drive prostate cancer (pca) growth, they may affect upr pathways. here, we show that the canonical upr pathways are directly and divergently regulated by androgens in pca cells, through the androgen receptor (ar), which is critical for pca survival. ar bound to gene regulatory sites and activated the ire1α branch, but simultaneously inhibited perk signaling. inhibition of the ire1α arm profoundly reduced pca cell growth in vitro as well as tumor formation in preclinical models of pca in vivo. consistently, ar and upr gene expression were correlated in human pca, and spliced xbp‐1 expression was significantly upregulated in cancer compared with normal prostate. these data establish a genetic switch orchestrated by ar that divergently regulates the upr pathways and suggest that targeting ire1α signaling may have therapeutic utility in pca. the neuroectodermal tumors neuroblastoma and melanoma represent biologically aggressive and chemoresistant cancers. the chemotherapeutic agents fenretinide and bortezomib induce apoptosis through endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress in these tumor types. the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the early events of er stress signaling and response pathways induced by fenretinide and bortezomib are mediated by the eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eif2α)-atf4 signaling pathway. treatment of neuroblastoma and melanoma cell lines with fenretinide, bortezomib, or thapsigargin resulted in induction of eif2α signaling, characterized by increased expression of phosphorylated eif2α, atf4, atf3, and gadd34. these events correlated with induction of the pro-apoptotic protein noxa. the cytotoxic response, characterized by up-regulation of noxa and cell death, was dependent on atf4, but not the er-related pro-death signaling pathways involving gadd153 or ire1. although perk-dependent phosphorylation of eif2α enhanced atf4 protein levels during er stress, cell death in response to fenretinide, bortezomib, or thapsigargin was not abrogated by inhibition of eif2α phosphorylation through perk knockdown or overexpression of wild-type eif2α. furthermore, atf4 induction in response to er stress was dependent primarily on transcriptional activation, which occurred in a perk- and phosphorylated eif2α-independent manner. these results demonstrate that atf4 mediates er stress-induced cell death of neuroectodermal tumor cells in response to fenretinide or bortezomib. understanding the complex regulation of cell death pathways in response to er stress-inducing drugs has the potential to reveal novel therapeutic targets, thus allowing the development of improved treatment strategies to overcome chemoresistance.
premenstrual dysphoric disorder (pmdd), a more severe form of premenstrual syndrome (pms), afflicts 5–8% of reproductive age women and results in significant functional impairment. we conducted a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial of adjunctive quetiapine in patients with pms/pmdd who had inadequate response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor/serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor therapy for their symptoms. premenstrual dysphoric disorder (pmdd) is a severe form of premenstrual syndrome, characterized by depressive, anxious, and somatic symptoms, associated to a significant reduction in social functioning and quality of life. although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) and oral contraceptives show a substantial effectiveness in pmdd, a wide percentage of women affected by pmdd do not respond to those first-line treatments. we present the case of a 42-year-old woman, affected by a disabling form of pmdd, who partially responded to an ssri treatment and significantly improved after an add-on therapy with lamotrigine. we therefore suggest that lamotrigine may be an efficacious and safe augmentation strategy in severe pmdd cases showing unsatisfactory or partial response to ssri treatments.
we have studied the effects of precursor amino acids (phenylalanine and cystein), elicitors (salicylic and acetylsalicylic acids, methyl jasmonate, β-aminobutyric acid, yeast extract), pal-inhibitor (1-amino-2-phenylethylphosphonic acid) applied alone or in combination on glucotropaeolin production and myrosinase activity in hairy root cultures of tropaeolum majus. short, 24-h treatment, and subsequent transfer of hairy roots to the fresh medium enabled avoiding detrimental effect of studied stimulators on biomass growth. in control cultures the highest glucotropaeolin content, 58.1 ± 6.7 mg g−1 dw, was detected on the 3rd day after transfer of the roots to the fresh medium but glucotropaeolin yield (mg 100 ml–1 culture volume) had been increasing until the 9th day after transfer as a result of continuous biomass growth. glucotropaeolin content and yield were 2-fold enhanced after treatment with precursor amino acids or pal-inhibitor alone, but their combination additively led to 4-fold increase in glucotropaeolin production. among the studied elicitors acetylsalicylic acid induced the highest, 3-fold increase in glucotropaeolin production, it also enhanced myrosinase activity, but to a smaller extend (by about 50%). acetylsalicylic acid also potentiated induced by precursors, pal-inhibitor, methyl jasmonate and yeast extract production of glucotropaeolin. the highest, 4.8-fold increase in glucotropaeolin production was found after combined acetylsalicylic acid and precursors treatment. additive effect of acetylsalicylic acid-combined treatment on myrosinase activity was not detected. the obtained results indicate that amino acid precursors, phenylalanine and cystein, availability may be a limiting factor in the process of stimulation of glucotropaeolin production in t. majus hairy root cultures. we obtained callus, cell suspension and hairy root cultures of tropaeolum majus and we demonstrated their ability to produce glucotropaeolin and myrosinase. in hairy roots glucotropaeolin content and myrosinase activity were higher in comparison with callus, cell suspension and leaves of intact plants. in hairy root cultures the highest glucotropaeolin contents were detected on the 9th day of culture. in relation to dry weight glucotropaeolin production by hairy roots was stimulated markedly by cystein and less by phenylalanine and methyl jasmonate. cystein inhibited biomass growth so in relation to culture volume stimulating effect of cystein on glucotropaeolin yield declined. myrosinase activity was stimulated by methyl jasmonate. the ratio of myrosinase activity to glucotropaeolin content in cultures with methyl jasmonate was much higher than in cultures with cystein.
backgroundthe child perceptions questionnaire (cpq11-14) is the most commonly used indicator of child oral health-related quality of life (ohrqol), and its validity and reliability have been studied both in english and in other linguistic contexts. the aim of this study was to develop a cpq11-14 for use in italy and to test its validity in a random sample of fourteen year-old italian adolescents.methodsonce the cpq11-14was translated into italian and adapted for an italian public, five hundred sixty-one adolescents were recruited for testing. parents rated their social status; the children/adolescents were administered the questionnaire and underwent a dental examination during which their dental status was taken and recorded. cronbach's alpha was used to assess the questionnaire’s internal consistency. spearman's correlation coefficients were calculated to assess construct validity between the total and subscale scores and the respondents’ global ratings on oral health and well-being. discriminant validity was analysed using the kruskal-wallis or mann–whitney tests in groups defined by gender, social position, caries experience and previous or no orthodontic treatment.resultsthe mean score on the cpq11-14 was 15.4 (sd=11.9), and the scores on all the domains were found to be highly skewed. cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.85 to 0.90. the global ratings on oral health and well-being were correlated to the total score and to the sub-scores except for those regarding the functional limitations. there were significant differences in the two genders, in the groups that had already or had not yet undergone orthodontic treatment, and in the social classification groups, while the difference between those who had and those who did not have caries experience did not reach statistical significance.conclusionsthe italian version of the cpq11-14 appears to be a reliable, valid instrument for italian children/adolescents. backgroundoral-health-related quality of life (ohrqol) instruments are being used with increasing frequency in oral health surveys. however, these instruments are not available in all countries or all languages. the availability of cross-culturally valid, multi-lingual versions of instruments is important for epidemiological research. the child perceptions questionnaire 11–14 (cpq11–14) is an ohrqol instrument that assesses the impact of oral conditions on the quality of life of children and adolescents. the objective of the current study was to carry out the cross-cultural adaptation of cpq11–14 for the brazilian portuguese language.methodsafter translation and cross-cultural adaptation, the cpq 11–14 was tested on 160 11-to-14-year-old children who were clinically and radiographically examined for the presence or absence of dental caries. the children were receiving dental care at the pediatric dental and orthodontic clinics of the federal university of minas gerais, brazil. to test the quality of the translation, 17 children answered the questionnaire. the internal consistency of the instrument was assessed by cronbach's alpha coefficient and the test-retest reliability by intraclass correlation coefficient (icc).resultsthe mean cpq11–14 score were 24.5 [standard deviation (sd) 18.27] in the group with caries and 12.89 [sd 10.95] in the group without caries. median scores were 20 and 10 in the groups with and without caries, respectively (p < 0.001). significant associations were identified between caries status and all cpq domains (p < 0.05). internal reliability was confirmed by a cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.86. test-retest reliability revealed satisfactory reproducibility (icc = 0.85). the questionnaire proved to be a valid instrument. construct validity was satisfactory, demonstrating highly significant correlations with global indicators for the total scale and subscales. the cpq11–14 score was able to discriminate between different oral conditions (groups without and with untreated caries).conclusionthe present study demonstrated that the cpq11–14 is applicable to children in brazil. it has satisfactory psychometric properties, but further research is required to evaluate these properties in a population study.
fruit flies in the family tephritidae are the economically important pests that have many species complexes. dna barcoding has gradually been verified as an effective tool for identifying species in a wide range of taxonomic groups, and there are several publications on rapid and accurate identification of fruit flies based on this technique; however, comprehensive analyses of large and new taxa for the effectiveness of dna barcoding for fruit flies identification have been rare. in this study, we evaluated the coi barcode sequences for the diagnosis of fruit flies using 1426 sequences for 73 species of bactrocera distributed worldwide. tree‐based [neighbour‐joining (nj)]; distance‐based, such as best match (bm), best close match (bcm) and minimum distance (md); and character‐based methods were used to evaluate the barcoding success rates obtained with maintaining the species complex in the data set, treating a species complex as a single taxon unit, and removing the species complex. our results indicate that the average divergence between species was 14.04% (0.00–25.16%), whereas within a species this was 0.81% (0.00–9.71%); the existence of species complexes largely reduced the barcoding success for tephritidae, for example relatively low success rates (74.4% based on bm and bcm and 84.8% based on md) were obtained when the sequences from species complexes were included in the analysis, whereas significantly higher success rates were achieved if the species complexes were treated as a single taxon or removed from the data set – bm (98.9%), bcm (98.5%) and md (97.5%), or bm (98.1%), bcm (97.4%) and md (98.2%). backgroundvarious methods have been proposed to assign unknown specimens to known species using their dna barcodes, while others have focused on using genetic divergence thresholds to estimate “species” diversity for a taxon, without a well-developed taxonomy and/or an extensive reference library of dna barcodes. the major goals of the present work were to: a) conduct the largest species-level barcoding study of the muscidae to date and characterize the range of genetic divergence values in the northern nearctic fauna; b) evaluate the correspondence between morphospecies and barcode groupings defined using both clustering-based and threshold-based approaches; and c) use the reference library produced to address taxonomic issues.resultsour data set included 1114 individuals and their coi sequences (951 from churchill, manitoba), representing 160 morphologically-determined species from 25 genera, covering 89% of the known fauna of churchill and 23% of the nearctic fauna. following an iterative process through which all specimens belonging to taxa with anomalous divergence values and/or monophyly issues were re-examined, identity was modified for 9 taxa, including the reinstatement of phaonia luteva (walker) stat. nov. as a species distinct from phaonia errans (meigen). in the post-reassessment data set, no distinct gap was found between maximum pairwise intraspecific distances (range 0.00-3.01%) and minimum interspecific distances (range: 0.77-11.33%). nevertheless, using a clustering-based approach, all individuals within 98% of species grouped with their conspecifics with high (>95%) bootstrap support; in contrast, a maximum species discrimination rate of 90% was obtained at the optimal threshold of 1.2%. dna barcoding enabled the determination of females from 5 ambiguous species pairs and confirmed that 16 morphospecies were genetically distinct from named taxa. there were morphological differences among all distinct genetic clusters; thus, no cases of cryptic species were detected.conclusionsour findings reveal the great utility of building a well-populated, species-level reference barcode database against which to compare unknowns. when such a library is unavailable, it is still possible to obtain a fairly accurate (within ~10%) rapid assessment of species richness based upon a barcode divergence threshold alone, but this approach is most accurate when the threshold is tuned to a particular taxon.
during an aerial archeological survey performed in spring 2009, we detected positive cropmarks (increased biomass production) indicating waste pits in the subsoil in a winter wheat (triticum aestivum l.) stand. based on pottery samples, the waste pits were dated to the end of the twelfth century or to the first half of the thirteenth century. the aim of this study was to investigate whether there were any differences in the soil chemical properties in arable and subsoil layers between cropmarks and the surrounding stands (controls) with normal crop growth. we also investigated how plant performance and biomass chemical properties differed between the cropmarks and controls. there were no differences in ph between cropmarks and controls in the 0–20 cm arable layer, but a substantially higher ph was recorded in the subsoil layer (30–40 cm) in cropmarks compared to controls, indicating deposited wood ash. similar results were recorded for plant available (mehlich iii) p, ca, mg, as and zn concentrations. plant height, spike length, flag leaf length, tiller density, spike density and standing dry matter biomass were substantially higher in cropmarks than in controls on both sampling dates (25 may and 18 july 2009). plant nutrition (n, k, ca and zn) was substantially improved in cropmarks compared to controls. a substantially higher density of roots was recorded in the subsoil of cropmarks compared to controls. in central european lowlands, ancient wood ash in the subsoil can irreversibly increase stand productivity. the presence of subsoil archeological features within the agricultural landscape can substantially increase the spatial variability of crop production on arable fields. tree species and wood ash application in plantations of short-rotation woody crops (srwc) may have important effects on the soil productive capacity through their influence on soil organic matter (som) and exchangeable cations. an experiment was conducted to assess changes in soil c and n contents and ph within the 0–50 cm depth, and exchangeable cation (ca2+, mg2+, k+, and na+) and extractable acidity concentrations within the 0–10 cm depth. the effects of different species (european larch [larix decidua p. mill.], aspen [populus tremula l. × populus tremuloides michx.], and four poplar [populus spp.] clones) and wood ash applications (0, 9, and 18 mg ha−1) on soil properties were evaluated, using a common garden experiment (n = 70 stands) over 7 years of management in michigan’s upper peninsula. soils were of the onaway series (fine-loamy, mixed, active, frigid inceptic hapludalfs). the nm-6 poplar clone had the greatest soil c and n contents in almost all ash treatment levels. soil c contents were 7.5, 19.4, and 10.7 mg c ha−1 greater under the nm-6 poplar than under larch in the ash-free, medium-, and high-level plots, respectively. within the surface layer, ash application increased soil c and n contents (p < 0.05) through the addition of about 0.7 mg c ha−1 and 3 kg n ha−1 with the 9 mg ha−1 ash application (twofold greater c and n amounts were added with the 18 mg ha−1 application). during a decadal time scale, tree species had no effects—except for k+—on the concentrations of the exchangeable cations, ph, and extractable acidity. in contrast, ash application increased soil ph and the concentration of ca2+ (p < 0.05), from 5.2 ± 0.4 cmolc kg−1 (ash-free plots) to 8.6 ± 0.4 cmolc kg−1 (high-level ash plots), and tended to increase the concentration of mg2+ (p < 0.1), while extractable acidity was reduced (p < 0.05) from 5.6 ± 0.2 cmolc kg−1 (ash-free plots) to 3.7 ± 0.2 cmolc kg−1 (high-level plots). wood ash application, within certain limits, not only had a beneficial effect on soil properties important to the long-term productivity of fast-growing plantations but also enhanced long-term soil c sequestration.
non-motor symptoms, including psychiatric disorders, are increasingly recognized as a major challenge in the treatment of parkinson's disease (pd). these ailments, which often appear in the early stage of the disease, affect a large number of patients and are only partly resolved by conventional antiparkinsonian medications, such as l-dopa. here, we investigated non-motor symptoms of pd in a mouse model based on bilateral injection of the toxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-ohda) in the dorsal striatum. this model presented only subtle gait modifications, which did not affect horizontal motor activity in the open-field test. bilateral 6-ohda lesion also impaired olfactory discrimination, in line with the anosmia typically observed in early stage parkinsonism. the effect of 6-ohda was then examined for mood-related dysfunctions. lesioned mice showed increased immobility in the forced swim test and tail suspension test, two behavioral paradigms of depression. moreover, the lesion exerted anxiogenic effects, as shown by reduced time spent in the open arms, in the elevated plus maze test, and by increased thigmotaxis in the open-field test. l-dopa did not modify depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors, which were instead counteracted by the dopamine d2/d3 receptor agonist, pramipexole. reboxetine, a noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, was also able to revert the depressive and anxiogenic effects produced by the lesion with 6-ohda. interestingly, pre-treatment with desipramine prior to injection of 6-ohda, which is commonly used to preserve noradrenaline neurons, did not modify the effect of the lesion on depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors. thus, in the present model, mood-related conditions are independent of the reduction of noradrenaline caused by 6-ohda. based on these findings we propose that the anti-depressive and anxiolytic action of reboxetine is mediated by promoting dopamine transmission through blockade of dopamine uptake from residual noradrenergic terminals. parkinson's disease (pd) is frequently accompanied by symptoms of depression and anxiety. however, the relationship between anxiety and depression has not been rigorously defined in these patients. in this study, 42 patients with pd and 21 matched medical controls were evaluated using dsm-iii-r criteria and a variety of psychiatric rating scales. twelve (29%) pd patients but only one medical control had a formal anxiety disorder diagnosis. of the 12 patients with pd who had an anxiety disorder diagnosis, 11 (92%) had a comorbid depressive disorder diagnosis. of the 18 patients with a depressive disorder, 12 (67%) also had an anxiety disorder diagnosis. furthermore, a stepwise regression analysis found that the depression measure explained 44% of the variance in anxiety measures whereas neither the severity of illness variables nor the levodopa dose contributed significantly to the variance. this study suggests that the excess anxiety found in pd patients is unlikely to be primarily a psychologic reaction to the illness or a side effect of levodopa treatment. rather, we suggest that anxiety and depression are related manifestations of the underlying neurochemical changes of pd itself.
transgenic plants have facilitated our understanding of the functional roles of genes and the metabolic processes affected in plants. recently, the or gene was isolated from an orange cauliflower mutant and it was shown that the or gene could serve as a novel genetic tool to enrich carotenoid content in transgenic potato tubers. an in-depth characterization of these or transgenic lines is presented here. it was found that the or transgene may facilitate the identification of potential rate-limiting step(s) of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway. the or transgenic tubers accumulated not only increased levels of carotenoids that normally are present in the controls, but also three additional metabolite intermediates of phytoene, phytofluene, and zeta-carotene, indicating that the desaturation steps became limiting following the expression of the or transgene. moreover, we observed that long-term cold storage greatly enhanced carotenoid content in the or transgenic tubers to a level of 10-fold over controls. expression of the or transgene in the transgenic plants caused no dramatic changes in the transcript levels of the endogenous carotenoid biosynthetic genes, which is in agreement with the or gene not directly controlling carotenoid biosynthesis. microscope analysis revealed that the or transgene conferred the formation of chromoplasts containing carotenoid sequestering structures in a heterologous system. such structures were not observed in tubers of potato cultivars that accumulate high levels of carotenoids. collectively, these results provide direct evidence demonstrating that the or gene indeed controls chromoplast differentiation and that regulation of chromoplast formation can have a profound effect on carotenoid accumulation in plants. in order to enhance the carotenoid content of potato tubers, transgenic potato plants have been produced expressing an erwinia uredovora crtb gene encoding phytoene synthase, specifically in the tuber of solanum tuberosum l. cultivar desiree which normally produces tubers containing c. 5.6 microg carotenoid g(-1) dw and also in solanum phureja l. cv. mayan gold which has a tuber carotenoid content of typically 20 microg carotenoid g(-1) dw. in developing tubers of transgenic crtb desiree lines, carotenoid levels reached 35 microg carotenoid g(-1) dw and the balance of carotenoids changed radically compared with controls: beta-carotene levels in the transgenic tubers reached c. 11 microg g(-1) dw, whereas control tubers contained negligible amounts and lutein accumulated to a level 19-fold higher than empty-vector transformed controls. the crtb gene was also transformed into s. phureja (cv. mayan gold), again resulting in an increase in total carotenoid content to 78 microg carotenoid g(-1) dw in the most affected transgenic line. in these tubers, the major carotenoids were violaxanthin, lutein, antheraxanthin, and beta-carotene. no increases in expression levels of the major carotenoid biosynthetic genes could be detected in the transgenic tubers, despite the large increase in carotenoid accumulation. microarray analysis was used to identify a number of genes that were consistently up- or down-regulated in transgenic crtb tubers compared with empty vector controls. the implications of these data from a nutritional standpoint and for further modifications of tuber carotenoid content are discussed.
objectives:this study aimed to determine time trends in the frequency of endoscopic esophagitis, and helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) infection in a large singaporean teaching hospital over a 10-yr period.methods:we studied a consecutive series of 16,375 patients who had been newly referred for diagnostic esophagogastroduodenoscopy from 1992 to 2001. all endoscopic findings were prospectively recorded. from 1995, an antral biopsy was taken from 6,185 unselected patients for an in-house biopsy urease test. endoscopic esophagitis was defined as the presence of erosions and/or ulceration. the relationship between erosive esophagitis and various relevant factors was analyzed.results:the overall prevalence of endoscopic esophagitis was 6.9% (95% ci, 6.5–7.3). it was 7.3% (95% ci, 6.2–8.4) in patients with a positive urease test, and 9.0% (95% ci, 8.1–9.9) in those in whom the urease test was negative (p < 0.001). from 1992 to 2001, the frequency of endoscopic esophagitis increased (p < 0.001 for trend) while that of positive urease test decreased from 1995 to 2001 (p < 0.001 for trend). the increase in the prevalence of endoscopic esophagitis (rr 1.99, 95% ci 1.18–3.36, p= 0.0098), and its inverse relationship with positive urease test results (rr 0.991, 95% ci 0.983–0.999, p= 0.049) remained significant even after adjusting for age, gender, ethnic distribution, and hiatal hernia.conclusions:the frequency of endoscopic esophagitis increased in singapore from 1992 to 2001. this increase within a short period of time suggests that environmental factors, of which the decreasing rate of h. pylori infection may be one, are important in the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease. the aim of this study was to determine, first, whether racial differences exist in the seroprevalence of helicobacter pylori infection in singapore, and second, whether these differences correlate with racial differences in peptic ulcer frequency. a commercial serological test for immunoglobulin (ig)g antibody to h. pylori which was 90% sensitive and 83% specific in our population was used to screen 403 adult blood donors of chinese, malay and indian origin, aged between 15–60 years. serum specimens from 84 paediatric patients admitted to the paediatrics department, national university of singapore, with non‐gastroenterological illnesses were also tested. in all three races, seroprevalence of h. pylori increased with age. indians have the highest prevalence of infection followed by chinese and malays. peptic ulcer prevalences are known to be highest in chinese, followed by indians and malays. the malays have the lowest prevalence of h. pylori and peptic ulcer among the three races in singapore. indians have a higher prevalence of h. pylori antibodies but a lower frequency of peptic ulcer than the chinese. racial differences in peptic ulcer frequency between chinese and indians are not explained by the prevalence of h. pylori infection; other environmental or genetic factors may be involved.
the effects of dietary protein content on the rates of gain and protein deposition were studied in iberian (ib) × duroc (du) 50:50 barrows at 2 stages of growth [10.6 ± 0.2 (n = 28) and 60.0 ± 0.4 (n = 24) kg initial bw]. two feeding, digestibility, and n-balance trials were performed. at each stage of growth, they were allocated in individual pens and given restrictedly (at 0.9 × ad libitum intake) one of 4 pelleted diets of similar energy concentration (13.8 to 14.5 mj me/kg dm), formulated to provide 4 different (ideal) cp contents (236, 223, 208, and 184 g cp/kg dm in the first trial, and 204, 180, 143, and 114 g cp/kg dm in the second trial). feed allowance was offered in 2 daily equal meals. the average concentration of lys was 6.59 ± 0.13 g /100 g cp for all diets. whatever the stage of growth, average daily bw gain and gain to feed ratio were unchanged by increases in dietary cp content (477 ± 7 and 1,088 ± 20 g, and 0.475 ± 0.027 and 0.340 ± 0.113, respectively, in the first and second trial). in pigs growing from 10 to 27 kg bw, the average rate of n retention increased linearly (p < 0.01) on increasing the protein content in the diet up to a break point, so a linear-plateau dose response was observed. pigs fed diets providing 208 to 236 g/kg dm did not differ in rate of protein deposition (pd). a maximum value of 87 (13.93 g n retained × 6.25) g pd/d was obtained when the diet supplied at least 208 g cp/kg dm. the broken-line regression analysis estimated dietary cp requirements at 211 g ideal cp (15.2 g total lys)/kg dm. in the fattening pigs, there was a quadratic response (p < 0.01) in the rate of n retention as dietary cp content increased. maximum n retention (18.7 g/d) was estimated from the first derivative of the function that relates the observed n retained (g/d) and dietary cp content (g/kg dm). this maximum value would be obtained by feeding a diet containing 185 g ideal cp (13.3 g total lys)/kg dm and represents the maximum capacity of the ib × du 50:50 pigs for protein accretion (i.e., 117 g pd/d). consequently, cross breeding of ib dams with duroc sires alters the metabolic response to dietary cp supply by increasing the potential of the crossbred to accrete protein and by modifying the pattern of pd response with bw. the objective of the present experiment was to define the form of the relationship between varying levels of energy intake at constant, high protein intake and the performance of young pigs. by doing so it was expected that we could distinguish between four models that predict the pig's responses to its diet as rates of protein and lipid retention. forty young pigs were assigned at 12 kg live weight either to an initial slaughter group (n 8) or to one of four allowances of starch intake at a constant intake of a high-protein feed (with 345 g crude protein (nitrogen x 6.25)/kg food). half the pigs were killed after 4 weeks and half after 8 weeks on the treatments; at each slaughter point on each treatment half the pigs were entire males and half were females. increasing the intake of starch (energy) resulted in significant increases in the rates of live weight, empty-body, protein and lipid gains of pigs slaughtered at both stages. there was no minimum positive lipid:protein ratio in the gain of the pigs. male pigs deposited more protein and less lipid than females but this effect of sex on protein and lipid retention was seen only on the two highest allowances of starch intake. the calculated efficiency of protein utilization increased with increasing starch intake up to a maximum of 0.81, when probably the energy:protein in the diet became non-limiting. the results led to the rejection of two of the models that predict the rates of protein and lipid retention as responses to protein and energy intake, but the two remaining models could not be rejected, at least qualitatively.
the presumptive altered dynamics of transient molecular interactions in vivo contributing to neurodegenerative diseases have remained elusive. here, using single-molecule localization microscopy, we show that disease-inducing huntingtin (mhtt) protein fragments display three distinct dynamic states in living cells – 1) fast diffusion, 2) dynamic clustering and 3) stable aggregation. large, stable aggregates of mhtt exclude chromatin and form 'sticky' decoy traps that impede target search processes of key regulators involved in neurological disorders. functional domain mapping based on super-resolution imaging reveals an unexpected role of aromatic amino acids in promoting protein-mhtt aggregate interactions. genome-wide expression analysis and numerical simulation experiments suggest mhtt aggregates reduce transcription factor target site sampling frequency and impair critical gene expression programs in striatal neurons. together, our results provide insights into how mhtt dynamically forms aggregates and disrupts the finely-balanced gene control mechanisms in neuronal cells. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/elife.17056.001 stress granules are membrane-less organelles composed of rna-binding proteins (rbps) and rna. functional impairment of stress granules has been implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, and multisystem proteinopathy-diseases that are characterized by fibrillar inclusions of rbps. genetic evidence suggests a link between persistent stress granules and the accumulation of pathological inclusions. here, we demonstrate that the disease-related rbp hnrnpa1 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (llps) into protein-rich droplets mediated by a low complexity sequence domain (lcd). while the lcd of hnrnpa1 is sufficient to mediate llps, the rna recognition motifs contribute to llps in the presence of rna, giving rise to several mechanisms for regulating assembly. importantly, while not required for llps, fibrillization is enhanced in protein-rich droplets. we suggest that lcd-mediated llps contributes to the assembly of stress granules and their liquid properties and provides a mechanistic link between persistent stress granules and fibrillar protein pathology in disease.
polydipsia is a serious condition often seen among patients with schizophrenia (scz). the cause of polydipsia is unknown; hence, it is hard to treat or manage. animal studies showed that the drinking behavior is regulated by central dopaminergic neurotransmission at the hypothalamus. meanwhile, the existence of a genetic predisposition to polydipsia in patients with scz has been suggested. the purpose of this study was to assess whether a functional polymorphism, val108/158met in the gene for catechol-o-methyltransferase (comt), is associated with susceptibility to polydipsia using a japanese sample of scz. our sample includes 330 chronic patients with scz (83 polydipsic patients and 247 non-polydipsic controls). the common comt val108/158met polymorphism was genotyped, and the differences in genotype distribution and allele frequency between cases and controls were evaluated using the χ2 test. a significant association between the comt val108/158met polymorphism and polydipsia was found (genotype distribution: χ2 = 13.0, df = 2, p = 0.001; allele frequency: χ2 = 7.50, df = 1, p = 0.006). the high-comt activity group (val/val) was more frequent among patients with polydipsia compared with the low-comt activity group (val/met + met/met) [odds ratio (or) = 2.46]. the association survived after controlling for other possible confounding factors, including gender, age, age of onset, current antipsychotic dose, and smoking status. our results suggest that the comt val108/158met genotype may confer susceptibility to polydipsia in scz. to our knowledge, this is the first association study between the comt gene and polydipsia in scz. further studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to confirm present findings. this case report concerns two schizophrenic patients with "psychogenic" polydipsia, without any underlying somatic disease. although case a showed a correlation between excessive water intake and severity of psychomotor disturbance, this could not be safely diagnosed as a water intoxication because the sodium serum level was normal. the lowered sodium serum level in case b, however, allowed us to conclude that the manifestation of grand mal was a sign of a genuine water intoxication. 27 casuistic studies on 67 patients with the syndrome of self-induced water intoxication in schizophrenics are then reviewed. finally, a variety of diagnostic and pathogenetic problems of this syndrome is discussed, with special reference to the role of inadequate adh secretion.
background thymopoiesis requires thymocyte-stroma interactions and proteases that promote cell migration by degrading extracellular matrix and releasing essential cytokines and chemokines. a role for several members of the a disintegrin and metalloprotease (adam) family in t cell development has been reported in the past. methodology/principal findings here, we present data indicating that the family member adam8 plays a role in thymic t cell development. we used qrtpcr on facs sorted thymic subsets together with immunofluorescene to analyze thymic adam8 expression. we found that adam8 was expressed in murine thymic stromal cells and at lower levels in thymocytes where its expression increased as cell matured, suggesting involvement of adam8 in thymopoiesis. further flow cytometry analysis revealed that adam8 deficient mice showed normal development and expansion of immature thymocyte subsets. there was however an intrathymic accumulation of single positive cd4 and cd8 t cells which was most noticeable in the late mature t cell subsets. accumulation of single positive t cells coincided with changes in the thymic architecture manifest in a decreased cortex/medulla ratio and an increase in medullary epithelial cells as determined by histology and flow cytometry. the increase in single positive t cells was thymus-intrinsic, independent of progenitor homing to the thymus or thymic exit rate of mature t cells. chemotaxis assays revealed that adam8 deficiency was associated with reduced migration of single positive thymocytes towards ccl21. conclusions/significance our results show that adam8 is involved in t cell maturation in the medulla and suggest a role for this protease in fine-tuning maturation of thymocytes in the medulla. in contrast to adam10 and adam17 lack of adam8 appears to have a relatively minor impact on t cell development, which was unexpected given that maturation of thymocytes is dependent on proper localization and timing of migration. although notch plays a crucial role in t cell development, regulation of notch signaling in the thymus is not well understood. kuzbanian, an adam protease, has been implicated in the cleavage of both notch receptors and the notch ligand, delta. in this study we show that the expression of a dominant-negative form of kuzbanian (dnkuz) leads to reduced tcrβ expression in double-negative thymocytes and to a partial block between the double-negative to double-positive stages of development. these defects were rescued by overexpression of delta-1 on thymocytes. mixed chimeras showed a cell-autonomous block by dnkuz, but non-cell-autonomous rescue by delta-1. this suggests that dnkuz impairs notch signaling in receiving cells, and increasing delta-1 on sending cells overcomes this defect. interestingly, the expression of an activated form of notch-1 rescued some, but not all, the defects in dnkuz tg mice. our data suggest that multiple notch-dependent steps in early thymocyte development require kuzbanian, but differ in the involvement of other notch signaling components.
inhibition of return (ior) refers to the performance disadvantage when detecting a target presented at a previously cued location. the current paper contributes to the long-standing debate whether ior is caused by attentional processing or perceptual processing. we present a series of four experiments which varied the cue luminance in mixed and blocked conditions. we hypothesised that if inhibition was initialized by an attentional process the size of ior should not vary in the blocked condition as participants should be able to adapt to the level of cue luminance. however, if a perceptual process triggers inhibition both experimental manipulations should lead to varying levels of ior. indeed, we found evidence for the latter hypothesis. in addition, we also varied the target luminance in blocked and mixed condition. both manipulations, cue luminance and target luminance, affected ior in an additive fashion suggesting that the two stimuli affect human behaviour on different processing stages. after presentation of a peripheral cue, facilitation at the cued location is followed by inhibition of return (ior). it has been recently proposed that ior may originate at different processing stages for manual and ocular responses, with manual ior resulting from inhibited attentional orienting, and ocular ior resulting form inhibited motor preparation. contrary to this interpretation, we found an effect of target contrast on saccadic ior. the effect of contrast decreased with increasing reaction times (rts) for saccades, but not for manual key-press responses. this may have masked the effect of contrast on ior with saccades in previous studies (hunt and kingstone in j exp psychol hum percept perform 29:1068–1074, 2003) because only mean rts were considered. we also found that background luminance strongly influenced the effects of gap and target contrast on ior.
four rats responded under a "self-control" procedure designed to obtain delay-discount functions within sessions. each session consisted of seven blocks, with seven trials within each block. each block consisted of two initial forced-choice trials followed by five free-choice trials. on choice trials, the rats could press either of two retractable levers. a press on one lever was followed by presentation of a smaller reinforcer (a single dipper presentation of a sucrose solution); a press on the other lever was followed by presentation of a larger reinforcer (four consecutive dipper presentations). the delay associated with the smaller reinforcer always was 0 s, whereas the signaled delay associated with the larger reinforcer increased across blocks (from 0 to 50 s). under these conditions, the percentage of choices of the larger reinforcer decreased across blocks, and relatively reliable delay-discount functions were obtained within sessions. doses of methylphenidate (1.0 to 17.0 mg/kg) and morphine (0.3 to 17.0 mg/kg) were then administered prior to selected sessions. typically, intermediate doses of methylphenidate shifted the discount functions to the right (increased choices of the larger reinforcer). for 2 of the rats, this effect was pronounced; for the other 2 rats, this effect occurred after the range of delays for the larger reinforcer was decreased (0 to 20 s). on the other hand, in most cases morphine produced a slight leftward shift in the discount function (decreased choices of the larger reinforcer). the present procedure appears to be a useful and efficient method to characterize drug effects on an entire delay-discount function. as with many procedures used to study self-control choices, however, sources of control other than reinforcement delay and amount may have been operating in the present study, and these sources must be considered when interpreting drug effects. this experiment evaluated the effects of methylphenidate on reinforced responding in rats. in each session the subjects (rats) earned reinforcement on seven different variable-interval reinforcement schedules. the average intervals varied from 108 to 3 s and provided reinforcement rates ranging from about 30 to 1100/h. response rate was a negatively accelerated function of reinforcement rate. low doses of methylphenidate (1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg) increased responding maintained by the four leanest schedules, but had little effect on responding maintained by the three densest schedules. in contrast, an 8.0 mg/kg dose increased responding maintained by the three densest schedules and slightly decreased responding maintained by leaner schedules. a quantitative model of reinforced responding, referred to as the matching law or response strength equation, was fitted to the data. this equation has two parameters. on the basis of previous experiments, one was used to measure changes in reinforcement efficacy and the other was used to measure changes in motor performance. the 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg doses changed the reinforcement parameter in the same way as did increases in deprivation and reward magnitude. the 8.0 mg/kg dose changed the motor parameter in the same was as did decreases in lever weight. it was concluded that methylphenidate increases reinforcement efficacy, and that the highest dose changed the topography of responding. the results are discussed in terms of the response strength equation, the rate dependency principle, and the question of how to interpret changes in reinforcement efficacy and motor performance.
maternal psychosocial distress is conceptualized as an important factor underlying the association between neighborhood deprivation and pregnancy outcomes. however, empirical studies to examine effects of neighborhood deprivation on psychosocial distress during pregnancy are scant. based on a large multicenter cohort of pregnant women in montreal, we examined (1) the extent to which psychosocial distress is clustered at the neighborhood-level, (2) the extent to which the clustering is explained by neighborhood material or social deprivation, and (3) whether associations between neighborhood deprivation and psychosocial distress persist after accounting for neighborhood composition (individual-level characteristics) using multilevel analyses. for 5,218 women residing in 740 neighborhoods, a prenatal interview at 24–26 gestational weeks measured both general and pregnancy-related psychological distress using well-validated scales: perceived stress, social support, depressive symptoms, optimism, commitment to the pregnancy, pregnancy-related anxiety, and maternal locus-of-control. neighborhood deprivation indices were linked to study participants by their residential postal code. neighborhood-level clustering (intraclass correlation) ranged from 1 to 2 % for perceived stress (lowest), optimism, pregnancy-related anxiety, and commitment to pregnancy to 4–6 % for perceived social support, depressive symptoms, and maternal locus of control (highest). neighborhood material deprivation explained far more of the clustering (23–75 %) than did social deprivation (no more than 4 %). although both material and social deprivation were associated with psychological distress in unadjusted analyses, the associations disappeared after accounting for individual-level socioeconomic characteristics. our results highlight the importance of accounting for individual-level socioeconomic characteristics in studies of potential neighborhood effects on maternal mental health. objectives we investigated the relationship between the depressive symptoms of older adults over time and the characteristics of the neighborhoods in which they live.   methods we surveyed a random sample of 1325 new york city residents aged 50 years or older in 2005 and conducted 808 follow-up interviews in 2007. we assessed the compositional characteristics of the respondents' neighborhoods at a census-tract level and determined the relationships between these characteristics and changes in respondents' depressive symptoms.   results in multivariable models that adjusted for individual-level covariates including income, a range of neighborhood characteristics predicted worsening depressive symptoms. factor analysis suggested that these characteristics operated in 3 clusters: neighborhood socioeconomic influences, residential stability, and racial/ethnic composition, with positive neighborhood socioeconomic influences being significantly protective against worsening symptoms. life stressors, personality trait neuroticism, african american race, and daily baseline contact with social networks were also associated with worsening symptoms.   conclusions an older adult's neighborhood of residence is an important determinant of his or her mental health. those making efforts to improve mental health among the elderly need to consider the role of residential context in improving or impairing mental health.
significantly lower endogenous expression of b‐cell translocation gene 2 (btg2) was observed in human muscle‐invasive bladder cancers (mibc) than matched normal tissues and non‐muscle invasive bladder cancers (nmibc). btg2 expression was inversely correlated with increased expression of the dna methyltransferases dnmt1 and dnmt3a in mibc, but not nmibc, suggesting a potential role for btg2 expression in muscle invasion of bladder cancer. over 90% of tumor tissues revealed strong methylation at cpg islands of the btg2 gene, compared with no methylation in the normal tissues, implying epigenetic regulation of btg2 expression in bladder carcinogenesis. by using ej bladder cancer cells and the demethylating agent decitabine, transcription of btg2 was shown to be up‐regulated by inhibiting dnmt1 expression via modification at cpg islands. dnmt1 binding to the btg2 gene further regulated btg2 expression by chromatin remodeling, such as h3k9 dimethylation and h3k4 trimethylation, and sp1 activation. induced btg2 expression significantly reduced ej cell tumorigenesis and invasiveness together with induction of g2/m arrest. these results demonstrate an important role for the btg2/tis21/pc3 gene in the progression of bladder cancers, and suggest that btg2/tis21/pc3 is a promising epigenetic target for prevention of muscle invasion in human bladder cancers. dye-ligand chromatography on cibacron blue f3ga-agarose has been used to resolve two species of dna (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase from nuclear extracts of uninduced friend murine erythroleukemia cells. each species has been highly purified; the activities in the first and second peaks were associated with polypeptides of mr 150,000 and 175,000, respectively. analysis of substrate specificity with synthetic dnas and restriction fragments of phi x174 replicative form dna and pbr322 dna showed that neither enzyme had dependence on the sequence context of cpg dinucleotides; poly(dg-dc) had the greatest methyl-accepting activity of any unmethylated dna substrate tested. de novo methylation by both enzymes was inefficient relative to methylation of hemimethylated sites. methyl-accepting activity was strongly dependent on dna chain length. this observation suggests that binding to dna, followed by one-dimensional diffusion of enzyme along the dna molecule, is important in the mechanism by which dna methyltransferase locates its recognition sites.
background amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als), partly caused by the mutations and aggregation of human copper, zinc superoxide dismutase (sod1), is a fatal degenerative disease of motor neurons. because sod1 is a major copper-binding protein present at relatively high concentration in motor neurons and copper can be a harmful pro-oxidant, we want to know whether aberrant copper biochemistry could underlie als pathogenesis. in this study, we have investigated and compared the effects of cupric ions on the aggregation of als-associated sod1 mutant a4v and oxidized wild-type sod1. methodology/principal findings as revealed by 90° light scattering, dynamic light scattering, sds-page, and atomic force microscopy, free cupric ions in solution not only induce the oxidation of either apo a4v or zn2-a4v and trigger the oligomerization and aggregation of oxidized a4v under copper-mediated oxidative conditions, but also trigger the aggregation of non-oxidized form of such a pathogenic mutant. as evidenced by mass spectrometry and sds-page, cys-111 is a primary target for oxidative modification of pathological human sod1 mutant a4v by either excess cu2+ or hydrogen peroxide. the results from isothermal titration calorimetry show that a4v possesses two sets of independent binding sites for cu2+: a moderate-affinity site (106 m-1) and a high-affinity site (108 m-1). furthermore, cu2+ binds to wild-type sod1 oxidized by hydrogen peroxide in a way similar to a4v, triggering the aggregation of such an oxidized form. conclusions/significance we demonstrate that excess cupric ions induce the oxidation and trigger the aggregation of a4v sod1, and suggest that cu2+ plays a key role in the mechanism of aggregation of both a4v and oxidized wild-type sod1. a plausible model for how pathological sod1 mutants aggregate in als-affected motor neurons with the disruption of copper homeostasis has been provided. the kinetics of bovine cu,zn superoxide dismutase were studied by pulse radiolysis. to ensure the absence of catalytically active free copper, commercially obtained holo-superoxide dismutase was demetallated, and the apo-superoxide dismutase concentrations were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry prior to reconstitution with defined amounts of copper and zinc. the catalytic rate constant was determined as a function of ionic strength over the range of 4-154 mm, and of the copper and zinc content. the catalytic rate constant increases with ionic strength up to (1.5 +/- 0.2) x 10(9) m(-1) s(-1) at an ionic strength of 15 mm, and then decreases. at ph 7 and 50 mm ionic strength, k = (1.2 +/- 0.2) x 10(9) m(-1) s(-1), and at a physiologically relevant ionic strength of 150 mm, it is (0.7 +/- 0.1) x 10 (9) m(-1) s(-1). the effect of ionic strength is ascribed to the inhomogeneous electric field generated by the surface charges of superoxide dismutase. the value of the catalytic rate constant at 50 mm is ca. 2-fold smaller than earlier values reported in the literature. the relationship between copper content and the catalytic rate constant shows that addition of more than a stoichiometric amount of copper cannot be masked efficiently by edta. the possibility exists that earlier reported values were based on experiments contaminated with trace amounts of copper.
backgroundin pakistan, plasmodium vivax is endemic causing approximately 70% of the malaria cases. a number of haematological changes, especially thrombocytopaenia have been reported for p. vivax. several host factors including cell-mediated immune cells, such as il-1, il-6 and il-10 have been documented for p. vivax-induced thrombocytopaenia. however, study on correlation of cytokines and thrombocytopaenia in p. vivax, particularly in patients with severe signs and symptoms has not been reported from pakistan.methodsa case control study to correlate tnf, il-6 and il-10 in healthy controls and thrombocytopaenic p. vivax-infected patients (both uncomplicated and complicated cases) from southern pakistan was carried out during january 2009 to december 2011. one hundred and eighty two patients presenting with microscopy-confirmed asexual p. vivax mono-infection and 100 healthy controls were enrolled in the study at aga khan university hospital, karachi. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) was performed for determination of tnf, il-6 and il-10 levels.resultsout of 182 cases, mild thrombocytopaenia (platelet count 100,000-150,000 mm3) was observed in ten (5.5%), moderate (50,000-100,000 mm3) in 93 (51.1%), and profound thrombocytopaenia (<50,000 mm3) was detected in 79 (43.4%) patients. il-6 and il-10 levels were found approximately three-fold higher in the mild cases compared to healthy controls. two-fold increase in tnf and il-10 (p < 0.0001) was observed in profound thrombocytopaenic when compared with moderate cases, while il-6 was not found to be significantly elevated.conclusioncytokines may have a possible role in p. vivax-induced thrombocytopaenia in pakistani population. findings from this study give first insight from pakistan on the role of cytokines in p.vivax-associated thrombocytopaenia. however, further studies are required to understand the relevance of cytokines in manifestations of thrombocytopaenia in p. vivax malaria. abstract interleukin-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine which shows a wide variety of biologic functions on various tissues and cells. indeed, il-6 acts not only on b cells but also on t cells, hepatocytes, hematopoietic progenitor cells, megakaryocytes, etc. in this review, i have attempted to summarize the new data concerning the effect of il-6 on megakaryocytes and platelets.
abstractpurpose the aim of the present study was to analyse and compare the clinical and radiological results after open posterior bone block procedure at long- (lt) and short-term (st) follow-up. the hypothesis was that placement of a bone block at the posterior glenoid rim in a technique of extending the glenoid surface will create permanent joint stability even in cases with hyperlaxity without a clinically relevant loss of motion or increase in osteoarthritis.methodsfifteen consecutive shoulders with recurrent posterior dislocation were evaluated clinically and radiologically. the rowe score, western ontario shoulder index, walch–duplay score and the constant–murley score were used for clinical evaluation. the patients were categorized according to their follow-up period as either st follow-up (min 12 months) or lt follow-up (min 42 months).resultsthe clinical results showed no significant difference between st (9) and lt (6) with good to very good overall results in the subjective as well as the objective scores (cs, rs, wds). at lt, most patients felt mild to minor pain under strain. the difference in pain between the groups was not significant. active ranges of motion and strength assessments were normal in all cases. in one case, recurrent dislocations occurred after bone graft resorption 6 months post-operatively. only one patient presented mild osteoarthritis, without further progress at follow-up.conclusionthe open posterior bone block procedure can be a successful treatment option for recurrent posterior shoulder instability at st and lt follow-up. this series showed a low rate of recurrent dislocations without development or progression of osteoarthritis. since soft tissue procedures do not always provide satisfying results, the posterior bone block augmentation presents a reliable technique for the treatment of symptomatic posterior instability.level of evidencecase series, treatment study, level iv. our purpose has been to describe an original surgical technique without describing all the problems concerning the posterior instability. the original technique has a double effect: active with the muscular flap and passively mechanic, if necessary, by the bone graft. five patients have been treated with this technique with a follow-up of one year and a half. 4 females and 1 male with an average age of 32 years 1/2. 2 were recurrent posterior instability, one unintentional and 2 intentional subluxations. 2 were epileptics. in all cases, the disparition of the instability was obtained. full range of movement and sport were resumed at the former level. on x-rays, the humeral head was centered. by its double mechanism, active with the muscular flap and possibly passive with the bone graft, this technic is reliable to treat the majority of posterior instability. it combines the way of action searched in physiotherapy and capsulomyoplasties to center the humeral head and this one by the bone graft in case of posterior glenoid fracture or dysplasia. it doesn't have the insufficiencies of physiotherapy or capsulomyoplasties in posterior traumatic instabilities, nor from the classical bone graft over the glenoid posterior wall, cause of osteoarthritis and pain.
background the regulation of infants' sleep is determined not only by biological factors but by relational aspects too. this study focused on maternal separation anxiety and examined its association with sleep-wake regulation at 10 months of age.   method in a community sample comprising 52 infants and their mothers, sleep was measured objectively with an activity monitor, as well as through questionnaires. the mothers reported on their own separation anxiety and on the child's perceived distress.   results the main finding was that maternal separation anxiety was linked to settling to sleep routines and to night-waking. the contribution of the mothers' own separation anxiety to their infants' night-waking remained significant after controlling for the child's fussiness.   conclusions consistent with the transactional perspective, the current research documented an interplay between maternal separation anxiety and aspects of the child's sleep-wake transitions. the relationships between aspects of parenting and infants' sleep patterns were studied longitudinally with 81 mother-child pairs. mothers' parenting orientation at 6 months was defined using the facilitator-regulator distinction. when the infants were 12 months old, mother and child participated in a laboratory-based developmental assessment which involved a brief separation episode. upon reunion, mothers reported on their concerns during separation; they also described their child's sleep. it was found that high maternal separation anxiety was related to night waking. in addition, night waking was more frequent among first born babies of facilitators compared with regulators. how maternal separation anxiety and care-giving orientation regulate aspects of the child's sleep awaits further explanation.
we have investigated the effect of extracellular proteases on the amiloride-sensitive na+ current (ina) in xenopus oocytes expressing the three subunits α, β, and γ of the rat or xenopus epithelial na+ channel (enac). low concentrations of trypsin (2 μg/ml) induced a large increase of ina within a few minutes, an effect that was fully prevented by soybean trypsin inhibitor, but not by amiloride. a similar effect was observed with chymotrypsin, but not with kallikrein. the trypsin-induced increase of ina was observed with xenopus and rat enac, and was very large (∼20-fold) with the channel obtained by coexpression of the α subunit of xenopus enac with the β and γ subunits of rat enac. the effect of trypsin was selective for enac, as shown by the absence of effect on the current due to expression of the k+ channel romk2. the effect of trypsin was not prevented by intracellular injection of egta nor by pretreatment with gtp-γs, suggesting that this effect was not mediated by g proteins. measurement of the channel protein expression at the oocyte surface by antibody binding to a flag epitope showed that the effect of trypsin was not accompanied by an increase in the channel protein density, indicating that proteolysis modified the activity of the channel present at the oocyte surface rather than the cell surface expression. at the single channel level, in the cell-attached mode, more active channels were observed in the patch when trypsin was present in the pipette, while no change in channel activity could be detected when trypsin was added to the bath solution around the patch pipette. we conclude that extracellular proteases are able to increase the open probability of the epithelial sodium channel by an effect that does not occur through activation of a g protein-coupled receptor, but rather through proteolysis of a protein that is either a constitutive part of the channel itself or closely associated with it. summarythe mammalian urinary bladder epithelium accommodates volume changes by the insertion and withdrawal of cytoplasmic vesicles. both apical membrane (which is entirely composed of fused vesicles) and the cytoplasmic vesicles contain three types of ionic conductances, one amiloride sensitive, an-other a cation-selective conductance and the third a cation conductance which seems to partition between the apical membrane and the mucosal solution. the transport properties of the apical membrane (which has been exposed to urine in vivo) differ from the cytoplasmic vesicles by possessing a lower density of amiloride-sensitive channels and a variable level of leak conductance. it was previously shown that glandular kallikrein was able to hydrolyze epithelial sodium channels into the leak conductance and that this leak conductance was further degraded into a channel which partitioned between the apical membrane and the mucosal solution. this report investigates whether kallikrein is the only urinary constituent capable of altering the apical membrane ionic permeability or whether other proteases or ionic conditions also irreversible modify apical membrane permeability.alterations of mucosal ph, urea concentrations, calcium concentrations or osmolarity did not irreversible affect the apical membrane ionic conductances. however, urokinase and plasmin (both serine proteases found in mammalian urine) were found to cause an irreversible loss of amiloride-sensitive current, a variable change in the leak current as well as the appearance of a third conductance which was unstable in the apical membrane and appears to partition between the apical membrane and the mucosal solution. amiloride protects the amiloride-sensitive conductance from hydrolysis but does not protect the leak pathway. neither channel is protected by sodium. fluctuation analysis demonstrated that the loss of amiloride-sensitive current was due to a decrease in the sodium-channel density and not a change in the single-channel current. assuming a simple model of sequential degradation, estimates of single-channel currents and conductances for both the leak channel and unstable leak channel are determined.
backgroundneisseria gonorrhoeae (gc) is a gram-negative pathogen that most commonly infects mucosal surfaces, causing sexually transmitted urethritis in men and endocervicitis in women. serious complications associated with these infections are frequent and include pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. the incidence of gonorrhea cases remains high globally while antibiotic treatment options, the sole counter measures against gonorrhea, are declining due to the remarkable ability of gc to acquire resistance. evaluating of potential drug targets is essential to provide opportunities for developing antimicrobials with new mechanisms of action. we propose the gc obg protein, belonging to the obg/cgta gtpase subfamily, as a potential target for the development of therapeutic interventions against gonorrhea, and in this study perform its initial functional and biochemical characterization.resultswe report that ngo1990 encodes obg protein, which is an essential factor for gc viability, associates predominantly with the large 50s ribosomal subunit, and is stably expressed under conditions relevant to infection of the human host. the anti-obg antisera cross-reacts with a panel of contemporary gc clinical isolates, demonstrating the ubiquitous nature of obg. the cellular levels of obg reach a maximum in the early logarithmic phase and remain constant throughout bacterial growth. the in vitro binding and hydrolysis of the fluorescent guanine nucleotide analogs mant-gtp and mant-gdp by recombinant wild type and t192at193a mutated variants of obg are also assessed.conclusionscharacterization of the gc obg at the molecular and functional levels presented herein may facilitate the future targeting of this protein with small molecule inhibitors and the evaluation of identified lead compounds for bactericidal activity against gc and other drug-resistant bacteria. when grown under anaerobic conditions, neisseria gonorrhoeae, the etiologic agent of the sexually transmitted disease gonorrhea, expresses several novel outer membrane proteins. one of these, pan 1, has an apparent molecular mass of 54 kda in electrophoresis and is recognized by serum samples from patients with gonococcal infection. the presence of antibodies to this protein in patient sera suggests that pan 1 is expressed during gonococcal infection and, more importantly, that n. gonorrhoeae grows anaerobically in vivo. we have cloned the pan 1 structural gene, ania, by screening a gonococcal lambda gt11 expression library with monospecific, polyclonal anti-pan 1 antiserum. three distinct immunoreactive recombinants, containing overlapping fragments of dna, were isolated and confirmed to be coding for pan 1 protein sequences. northern (rna blot) hybridization of an insert from an ania recombinant to total gonococcal cellular rna revealed the presence of a 1.5-kb transcript that was specific to rna from anaerobically grown gonococci, indicating that the ania gene is regulated at the transcriptional level and is monocistronic. to characterize the ania gene, we have sequenced the entire 2-kb region spanned by the overlapping recombinants. we have also performed primer extension analysis on rna isolated from aerobically and anaerobically grown gonococci in order to define the ania promoter region. two putative primer extension products specific to organisms grown anaerobically were identified by homology to known escherichia coli promoter sequences, suggesting that the regulation of ania expression involves multiple promoter regions.
accurate prediction of in vivo hepatic drug clearance using in vitro assays is important to properly estimate clinical dosing regimens. clearance of low-turnover compounds is especially difficult to predict using short-lived suspensions of unpooled primary human hepatocytes (phhs) and functionally declining phh monolayers. micropatterned cocultures (mpccs) of phhs and 3t3-j2 fibroblasts have been shown previously to display major liver functions for several weeks in vitro. in this study, we first characterized long-term activities of major cytochrome p450 enzymes in mpccs created from unpooled cryopreserved phh donors. mpccs were then used to predict the clearance of 26 drugs that exhibit a wide range of turnover rates in vivo (0.05–19.5 ml/min per kilogram). mpccs predicted 73, 92, and 96% of drug clearance values for all tested drugs within 2-fold, 3-fold, and 4-fold of in vivo values, respectively. there was good correlation (r2 = 0.94, slope = 1.05) of predictions between the two phh donors. on the other hand, suspension hepatocytes and conventional monolayers created from the same donor had significantly reduced predictive capacity (i.e., 30–50% clearance values within 4-fold of in vivo), and were not able to metabolize several drugs. finally, we modulated drug clearance in mpccs by inducing or inhibiting p450s. rifampin-mediated cyp3a4 induction increased midazolam clearance by 73%, while cyp3a4 inhibition with ritonavir decreased midazolam clearance by 79%. similarly, quinidine-mediated cyp2d6 inhibition reduced clearance of dextromethorphan and desipramine by 71 and 22%, respectively. in conclusion, mpccs created using cryopreserved unpooled phhs can be used for drug clearance predictions and to model drug-drug interactions. various incubation conditions of human hepatocytes were compared for their accuracy in predicting the in vivo hepatic clearance (clh) of model compounds. the test compounds were the highly cleared, low protein bound naloxone (in vivo clh = 25 ml min−1 kg−1; free fraction = 0.6), the medium clearance, highly protein bound midazolam (clh = 12 ml min−1 kg−1; free fraction = 0.04) and the low clearance, highly protein bound bosentan (clh = 3.9 ml min−1 kg−1; free fraction = 0.02). each compound was tested in three ‘hepatocyte systems’, using resections from three donors, in the presence and absence of human serum. those hepatocyte systems were: conventional primary cultures, freshly isolated suspensions and cryopreserved suspended hepatocytes. except for a twofold overestimated clh for bosentan from conventional primary cultures, and despite variable cryopreservation recoveries, similar predictions of clh were recorded with all hepatocyte systems. moreover, the clh values obtained with cryopreserved suspended hepatocytes were similar to those obtained with freshly isolated suspensions. for midazolam and bosentan, the predicted in vivo clh was markedly higher in the presence of serum, whereas serum had little influence on the scaled-up clh of naloxone. in vivo, clh was properly approached for naloxone and bosentan (particularly from experiments in the presence of serum), but it was strongly underestimated for midazolam (particularly in the absence of serum). additional compounds need to be investigated to confirm the above findings as well as to assess why the clearances of some highly protein-bound compounds are still considerably underestimated.
the phosphorylation of glutamate receptor 1 (glur1) has been increasingly implicated in the formation and maintenance of plastic responses. to investigate molecular mechanisms that underlie the persisting alterations in motor response occurring with levodopa treatment of parkinsonian patients, we evaluated the time course of these changes in relation to the phosphorylation of glur1 in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-ohda) lesioned animals. three weeks of twice-daily levodopa administration to rats shortened the duration of the rotational responses and increased the peak turning responses, which lasted at least 7 days after withdrawal of chronic levodopa treatment. the shortened response duration and increased peak turning, resembling human wearing-off fluctuations and dyskinesia, were associated with a marked increase in ser-845 phosphorylated glur1 (pglur1s845) immunoreactivity in lesioned striatum in response to levodopa treatment. the time course of changes in glur1 phosphorylation correlated with the time course of changes in motor behavior after withdrawal of chronic levodopa therapy. our immunostaining data showed that these changes were confined to parvalbumin-positive neurons where glur1 are exclusively expressed. both the altered motor response and the degree of pglur1s845 were attenuated by the intrastriatal administration of protein kinase a (pka) inhibitor rp-camps or glur1 antisense oligonucleotides. the results suggest that ser-845 glur1 phosphorylation within parvalbumin-positive neurons contributes to the persistence of the motor response alterations produced by chronic intermittent dopaminergic stimulation. background the mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) kinase plays a key role in translational control of a subset of mrnas through regulation of its initiation step. in neurons, mtor is present at the synaptic region, where it modulates the activity-dependent expression of locally-translated proteins independently of mrna synthesis. indeed, mtor is necessary for different forms of synaptic plasticity and long-term memory (ltm) formation. however, little is known about the time course of mtor activation and the extracellular signals governing this process or the identity of the proteins whose translation is regulated by this kinase, during mnemonic processing. methodology/principal findings here we show that consolidation of inhibitory avoidance (ia) ltm entails mtor activation in the dorsal hippocampus at the moment of and 3 h after training and is associated with a rapid and rapamycin-sensitive increase in ampa receptor glur1 subunit expression, which was also blocked by intra-hippocampal delivery of glur1 antisense oligonucleotides (aso). in addition, we found that pre- or post-training administration of function-blocking anti-bdnf antibodies into dorsal ca1 hampered ia ltm retention, abolished the learning-induced biphasic activation of mtor and its readout, p70s6k and blocked glur1 expression, indicating that bdnf is an upstream factor controlling mtor signaling during fear-memory consolidation. interestingly, bdnf aso hindered ltm retention only when given into dorsal ca1 1 h after but not 2 h before training, suggesting that bdnf controls the biphasic requirement of mtor during ltm consolidation through different mechanisms: an early one involving bdnf already available at the moment of training, and a late one, happening around 3 h post-training that needs de novo synthesis of this neurotrophin. conclusions/significance in conclusion, our findings demonstrate that: 1) mtor-mediated mrna translation is required for memory consolidation during at least two restricted time windows; 2) this kinase acts downstream bdnf in the hippocampus and; 3) it controls the increase of synaptic glur1 necessary for memory consolidation.
the coordinated interactions between individuals are fundamental for the success of the activities in some professional categories. we reported on brain-to-brain cooperative interactions between civil pilots during a simulated flight. we demonstrated for the first time how the combination of neuroelectrical hyperscanning and intersubject connectivity could provide indicators sensitive to the humans’ degree of synchronization under a highly demanding task performed in an ecological environment. our results showed how intersubject connectivity was able to i) characterize the degree of cooperation between pilots in different phases of the flight, and ii) to highlight the role of specific brain macro areas in cooperative behavior. during the most cooperative flight phases pilots showed, in fact, dense patterns of interbrain connectivity, mainly linking frontal and parietal brain areas. on the contrary, the amount of interbrain connections went close to zero in the non-cooperative phase. the reliability of the interbrain connectivity patterns was verified by means of a baseline condition represented by formal couples, i.e. pilots paired offline for the connectivity analysis but not simultaneously recorded during the flight. interbrain density was, in fact, significantly higher in real couples with respect to formal couples in the cooperative flight phases. all the achieved results demonstrated how the description of brain networks at the basis of cooperation could effectively benefit from a hyperscanning approach. interbrain connectivity was, in fact, more informative in the investigation of cooperative behavior with respect to established eeg signal processing methodologies applied at a single subject level. background performing mission tasks in a simulator influences many neurophysiological measures. quantitative assessments of electroencephalography (eeg) and electrocardiography (ecg) have made it possible to develop indicators of mental workload and to estimate relative physiological responses to cognitive requirements.   objective to evaluate the effects of mental workload without actual physical risk, we studied the cortical and cardiovascular changes that occurred during simulated flight.   methods there were 12 pilots (8 novices and 4 experts) who simulated a flight composed of 10 sequences that induced several different mental workload levels. eeg was recorded at 12 electrode sites during rest and flight sequences; ecg activity was also recorded. subjective tests were used to evaluate anxiety and vigilance levels.   results theta band activity was lower during the two simulated flight rest sequences than during visual and instrument flight sequences at central, parietal, and occipital sites (p < 0.05). on the other hand, rest sequences resulted in higher beta (at the c4 site; p < 0.05) and gamma (at the central, parietal, and occipital sites; p < 0.05) power than active segments. the mean heart rate (hr) was not significantly different during any simulated flight sequence, but hr was lower for expert subjects than for novices. the subjective tests revealed no significant anxiety and high values for vigilance levels before and during flight.   conclusions the different flight sequences performed on the simulator resulted in electrophysiological changes that expressed variations in mental workload. these results corroborate those found during study of real flights, particularly during sequences requiring the heaviest mental workload.
unlabelled the prevalence of cow's milk protein allergy (cmpa) has increased in recent years, and is associated with antimicrobial use during the perinatal period, prematurity, the type of childbirth, and the decrease in breastfeeding. the aim of this study was to analyze whether there is any association between these factors and the development of cmpa.   material and methods a retrospective, comparative, cross-sectional, observational study was conducted by reviewing the case records of 101 children diagnosed with cmpa and seen at the department of gastroenterology and nutrition of the instituto nacional de pediatría within the time frame of january 2012 and august 2013. the following variables were included: age, sex, weeks of gestation, history of maternal infection and antimicrobial use during the pregnancy, type of delivery, and feeding with human milk, and its duration. likewise, the case records of 90 children were reviewed as a control group on not having cmpa or any other allergy. the chi-square test was used for proportions, and the mann-whitney u test was used for comparing means in the statistical analysis.   results the factors associated with cmpa were the use of antimicrobials during gestation and breastfeeding duration in months. both factors were statistically significant (p<.001). no association was found between cmpa and gestational age or type of delivery.   conclusions the statistically significant associated factors were breastfeeding duration and the use of antimicrobials during the gestational stage. these results underline the necessity for prospective studies. the concentrations of beta-lactoglobulin was measured in the sera of 47 preterm an term neonates during the first few days of life under standardised conditions after feeding with a cows' milk'based formula. preterm neonates, particularly those of less than 33 weeks' gestation, had higher serum concentrations of beta-lactoglobulin than term neonates given an equivalent mild feed. prior feeding with breast milk did not diminish the amount of beta-lactoglobulin absorbed. our results suggest tha te ability of the gastrointestinal tract to exclude antigenically intact food proteins increases with gestational age and that gut closure occurs normally before birth in man.
the mechanical behavior of an atherosclerotic plaque may encode information about the type, composition, and vulnerability to rupture. human arterial segments with varying plaque burden were analyzed ex vivo with optical coherence tomography (oct) to determine plaque type and to determine compliance during pulsatile inflation in their native geometry. calcifications and lipid filled plaques showed markedly different compliance when analyzed with oct wall motion analysis. there was also a trend towards increased circumferential variation in arterial compliance with increasing plaque burden. background:the composition of an atherosclerotic plaque is considered more important than the degree of stenosis. an unstable lesion may rupture and cause an acute thrombotic reaction. most of these lesions contain a large lipid pool covered by an inflamed thin fibrous cap. the stress in the cap increases with decreasing cap thickness and increasing macrophage infiltration. intravascular ultrasound (ivus) palpography might be an ideal technique to assess the mechanical properties of high-risk plaques.technique:palpography assesses the local mechanical properties of tissue using its deformation caused by the intraluminal pressure.in vitro validation:the technique was validated in vitro using diseased human coronary and femoral arteries. especially between fibrous and fatty tissue, a highly significant difference in strain (p = 0.0012) was found. additionally, the predictive value to identify the vulnerable plaque was investigated. a high-strain region at the lumen-vessel wall boundary has an 88% sensitivity and 89% specificity for identifying such plaques.in vivo validation:in vivo, the technique was validated in an atherosclerotic yucatan minipig animal model. this study also revealed higher strain values in fatty than fibrous plaques (p < 0.001). the presence of a high-strain region at the lumenplaque interface has a high predictive value to identify macrophages.patient studies:patient studies revealed high-strain values (1–2%) in thin-cap fibrous atheroma. calcified material showed low strain values (0–0.2%). with the development of three-dimensional (3-d) palpography, identification of highstrain spots over the full length of a coronary artery becomes available.conclusion:intravascular palpography is a unique tool to assess lesion composition and vulnerability. the development of 3-d palpography provides a technique that may develop into a clinical tool to identify the high-risk plaque.hintergrund:die zusammensetzung einer atherosklerotischen plaque wird als wichtiger erachtet als deren stenosegrad. eine instabile läsion kann aufbrechen und eine thrombotische reaktion auslösen. die mehrzahl dieser läsionen enthält einen großen lipidreichen kern, der von einer dünnen entzündeten kappe bedeckt ist. der stress in der kappe erhöht sich mit abnehmender dicke der kappe und zunehmender makrophageninfiltration. die intravaskuläre ultraschall- (ivus-)palpographie könnte die ideale technik zur beurteilung der mechanischen eigenschaften von hochrisikoplaques darstellen.technik:die palpographie erfasst die lokalen mechanischen eigenschaften von gewebe mit hilfe der durch den intravaskulären druck erzeugten deformation.in-vitro-validierung:die methode wurde durch untersuchung erkrankter koronar- und femoralarterien validiert. insbesondere zwischen fibrösem und fetthaltigem gewebe ließ sich ein hochsignifikanter unterschied bezüglich der gewebsdehnung feststellen (p = 0,0012). zudem wurde der prädiktive wert für die diagnose einer vulnerablen plaque untersucht. eine stelle mit hoher dehnung an der gefäßoberfläche hat eine sensitivität von 88% und eine spezifität von 89% für die erkennung solcher plaques.in-vivo-validierung:in vivo wurde die technik in einem atherosklerotischen yucatan-minischwein-modell validiert. auch diese untersuchung zeigte höhere dehnungswerte in fetthaltigen gegenüber fibrösen plaques (p < 0,001). zudem hat das vorliegen hoher dehnungswerte an der plaqueoberfläche einen hohen prädiktiven wert für die erkennung von makrophagen.patientenstudien:patientenstudien ergaben hohe dehnungswerte (1–2%) in fetthaltigen plaques mit dünner kappe. kalzifiziertes material zeigte niedrige dehnungswerte (0–0,2%). durch die entwicklung der dreidimensionalen (3-d) palpographie wird die identifikation von stellen mit hohen dehnungswerten im kompletten koronarsystem möglich.schlussfolgerung:wie keine andere methode gestattet die intravaskuläre palpographie, zusammensetzung und vulnerabilität einer läsion zu beurteilen. die entwicklung der 3-d-palpographie stellt eine technik zur verfügung, die sich zu einem klinischen hilfsmittel zur identifizierung von hochrisikoplaques entwickeln könnte.
a rapid method has been developed for separation of the major plasma lipoproteins from up to 96 ml of plasma by a single ultracentrifugation step. this separation was achieved by a discontinuous density gradient centrifugation between the density range of 1.006 and 1.30 g/ml in sorvall vertical rotors. each lipoprotein fraction was sharply banded with vldl at the top, ldl in the upper middle, and hdl in the lower middle portion of the tube. use of authentic 125i-labeled lipoproteins showed that complete separation of the three major classes and partial separation of hdl2 and hdl3 was achieved. the lipoprotein fractions prepared by this technique have properties indistinguishable from those isolated by the sequential flotation method in regard to their equilibrium banding density, electrophoretic mobility, and apolipoprotein composition. this method is suitable for the preparative isolation of lipoproteins as well as for quantitative clinical determinations of cholesterol and triglycerides in vldl, ldl and hdl fractions of plasma. used as an analytical tool this method allows samples as small as 1 ml of plasma and spin times as short as 45 min. cholesterol levels in hdl fractions separated by this method have significantly lower values (p less than 0.05) than those estimated by the heparin-manganese chloride precipitation method. abstract the separation of plasma lipoproteins into vldl, ldl, and hdl by a single 24-hr ultracentrifugation in swinging-bucket rotors is described. the mean recovery of loaded lipoprotein cholesterol is 89.3 ± 1.3%. the method employs a discontinuous salt gradient and separates vldl, ldl, and hdl as verified by cellulose acetate- and immuno-electrophoresis. the method offers some advantages for research applications.
viral marketing mechanisms use the existing social network between customers to spread information about products and encourage product adoption. existing viral marketing models focus on the dynamics of the diffusion process, however they typically: (a) only consider a single product campaign and (b) fail to model the evolution of the social network, as the trust between individuals changes over time, during the course of multiple campaigns. in this work, we propose an adaptive viral marketing model which captures: (1) multiple different product campaigns, (2) the diversity in customer preferences among different product categories, and (3) changing confidence in peers’ recommendations over time. by applying our model to a real-world network extracted from the digg social news website, we provide insights into the effects of network dynamics on the different products’ adoption. our experiments show that our proposed model outperforms earlier non-adaptive diffusion models in predicting future product adoptions. we also show how this model can be used to explore new viral marketing strategies that are more successful than classic strategies which ignore the dynamic nature of social networks. the new social media sites — blogs, wikis, flickr and digg, among others — underscore the transformation of the web to a participatory medium in which users are actively creating, evaluating and distributing information. digg is a social news aggregator which allows users to submit links to, vote on and discuss news stories. each day digg selects a handful of stories to feature on its front page. rather than rely on the opinion of a few editors, digg aggregates opinions of thousands of its users to decide which stories to promote to the front page. digg users can designate other users as “friends” and easily track friends’ activities: what new stories they submitted, commented on or read. the friends interface acts as a social filtering system, recommending to user stories his or her friends liked or found interesting. by tracking the votes received by newly submitted stories over time, we showed that social filtering is an effective information filtering approach. specifically, we showed that (a) users tend to like stories submitted by friends and (b) users tend to like stories their friends read and liked. social filtering is a promising new technology that can be used to personalize and tailor information to individual users: for example, through personal front pages.
much research has been conducted to comprehend the mechanisms of high pressure (hp) inactivation of spores in aqueous systems but for food model systems these information are scarce. in these systems spores can interact with ingredients which then could possibly lead to retarded or reduced inactivation, which can cause a problem for the sterilization process. the protective mechanism of a reduced aw-value is still unclear. hp processing might prove valuable to overcome protective effects of solutes and achieve shorter process times for sterilization under hp. to gain insight into the underlying mechanisms five aw-values (0.9, 0.92, 0.94, 0.96, 1) were adjusted with two different solutes (nacl, sucrose). solutions were inoculated with spores of bacillus amyloliquefaciens and treated at 105, 110, and 115°c at 600 mpa. further a thermal inactivation was conducted at the same temperatures for a comparison with the hp data. afterward, the influence of hp high temperature treatment on the inactivation, the dipicolinic acid (dpa)-release and membrane constitution was assessed by plate count, hplc and flow cytometry (fcm). the results show that during hp treatments sucrose and salt both have a protective effect, in which the influence of sucrose on the retarded inactivation is higher. the threshold water activities (aw), which is 0.94, here salt and sucrose have a significant influence on the inactivation. the comparison of thermal (105–115°c) and hp and high temperature (600 mpa, 105–115°c) treated samples showed that the time needed to achieve a 4–5 log10 inactivation is reduced from 45 (aw = 1) to 75 (aw = 0.9) min at 105°c to 3 (aw = 1) to 15 (aw = 0.9) minutes at 600 mpa and 105°c. the release of dpa is the rate limiting step of the inactivation and therefore monitoring the release is of great interest. the dpa-release is slowed down in high concentrated solutions (e.g., sucrose, salt) in comparison to aw 1. since there is a difference in the way the solutes protect the spore it could be seen as an inner spore membrane effect. maybe as shown for vegetative microorganism the solutes can interact with membranes, e.g., the inner spore membrane. flow cytometry (fcm) measurement data show a similar trend. the influence of ph, aw, l-alanine, and fat concentration of milk on the initiation of germination and inactivation by high hydrostatic pressure (hhp) (250 mpa at 25 degrees c for 15 min and 690 mpa at 40 degrees c for 2 min) of bacillus cereus sporulated at 20, 30 and 37 degrees c was investigated. b. cereus sporulated at the lowest temperature was found to be the most resistant to the initiation of germination and inactivation by hhp. at ambient pressure, the rate and extension of germination induced by l-alanine were also lower in b. cereus sporulated at 20 than 30 or 37 degrees c. the optimum ph for the germination and inactivation of b. cereus depended on the sporulation temperature. at 250 mpa the extent of germination for the three suspensions increased with higher ph. at 690 mpa, the ph barely affected the germination of b. cereus sporulated at 20 degrees c (3 log cycles), but the inactivation increased as the ph of the medium was lowered. after the same treatment, pressure optimally initiated the germination of b. cereus sporulated at 30 and 37 degrees c (6-7 log cycles) around neutral ph. higher inactivation was obtained at ph 6. high concentrations of sucrose protected the spores from the germinating and inactivating effect of hhp. at aw 0.92, no germination was detected when the spores were pressurized at 250 mpa, and only 1 log cycle of b. cereus sporulated at 20 and 30 degrees c and 2 log cycles of b. cereus sporulated at 37 degrees c were germinated at 690 mpa. in addition, no inactivation was observed at aw 0.92 even at 690 mpa. the presence of l-alanine in the medium of pressurization increased the germination initiated by hhp at 250 mpa, but not at 690 mpa. a combination of 250 mpa at 25 degrees c with l-alanine (100 mm) was found to give an additive response. the initiation of germination and inactivation by hhp were not affected by the fat concentration of the milk.
introductionin the past few years, comprehensive smoke-free laws that prohibit smoking in all workplaces have been introduced in many jurisdictions in the us, canada, and europe. in this paper, we review published studies to ascertain if there is any evidence of health benefits resulting from the implementation of these laws.methodsall papers relating to smoke-free legislation published in or after 2004 were considered for inclusion in this review. we used pubmed, google scholar, and web of science as the main search tools. the primary focus of the paper is on health outcomes, and thus many papers that only report exposure data are not included.resultsstudies using subjective measures of respiratory health based on questionnaire data alone consistently reported that workers experience fewer respiratory and irritant symptoms following the introduction of smoke-free laws. some studies also found measured improvements in the lung function of workers. however, the most dramatic health outcome associated with smoke-free laws has been the reduction in myocardial infarction in the general population. this outcome has been observed in the us, canada, and europe, with studies reporting reductions of between 6 and 40%, post-legislation, the larger reductions being mostly from studies with smaller population groups. the evidence as to whether these smoke-free laws have helped smokers to stop smoking or to reduce tobacco consumption is less clear.conclusionsthere is now significant body of published literature that demonstrates that smoke-free laws can lead to improvements in the health of both workers who are occupationally exposed and of the general population. there is no longer any reason why non-smokers should be exposed to shs in any workplace. we recommend that all countries adopt national smoke-free laws that are in line with article 8 of the who framework convention on tobacco control that sets out recommendations for the development, implementation, and enforcement of national, comprehensive smoke-free laws. background— secondhand smoke exposure increases the risk of acute myocardial infarction (ami). one study (helena, mont) examined the issue and found a decrease in ami associated with a smoke-free ordinance. we sought to determine the impact of a smoke-free ordinance on ami admission rates in another geographically isolated community (pueblo, colo). methods and results— we assessed ami hospitalizations in pueblo during a 3-year period, 1.5 years before and 1.5 years after implementation of a smoke-free ordinance. we compared the ami hospitalization rates among individuals residing within city limits, the area where the ordinance applied, versus those outside city limits. we also compared ami rates during this time period with another geographically isolated but proximal community, el paso county, colo, that did not have an ordinance. a total of 855 patients were hospitalized with a diagnosis of primary ami in pueblo between january 1, 2002, and december 31, 2004. a reduction in ami hospitalizations was observed in the period after the ordinance among pueblo city limit residents (relative risk [rr]=0.73, 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.63 to 0.85). no significant changes in ami rates were observed among residents outside city limits (rr=0.85, 95% ci 0.63 to 1.16) or in el paso county during the same period (rr=0.97, 95% ci 0.89 to 1.06). the reduction in ami rate within pueblo differed significantly from changes in the external control group (el paso county) even after adjustment for seasonal trends (p<0.001). conclusions— a public ordinance reducing exposure to secondhand smoke was associated with a decrease in ami hospitalizations in pueblo, colo, which supports previous data from a smaller study.
we have previously shown that participants who step in place while viewing a moving scene that simulates walking towards and turning a corner demonstrate anticipatory sequential reorientation of axial body segments with timing characteristics similar to those seen during real turning. we propose that the coordination of axial body segments during steering represents a robust pre-programmed postural synergy triggered by gaze realignment in the desired direction of travel. the primary aim of the current study was to test this hypothesis by studying the effects of constraining eye movement on visually evoked steering responses exhibited by participants stepping in place in a virtual environment. we predicted that preventing participants from generating anticipatory gaze shifts would significantly attenuate or eliminate visually evoked postural responses. a secondary aim was to investigate the nature of the visual cues that trigger the coordinated eye and whole body response by testing whether spatial (distance from the corner) or temporal (time to contact with corner) parameters modulated with the speed of the visual scene (normal, half speed and double speed). six university graduate student (27.8 ± 5.0 years) participants were asked to step in place at a self-selected comfortable pace while immersed in a virtual environment which simulated walking down a hallway and turning a corner. in half of the trials participants were required to maintain gaze direction on a static target placed in the middle of the viewing screen. whole body kinematics and gaze behaviour were recorded. in support of our hypothesis, gaze fixation on a stationary target resulted in the suppression of anticipatory steering responses. although postural adjustments were still observed during constrained gaze trials, they were reactive rather than anticipatory in nature and were significantly smaller than trials in which gaze was unconstrained. our results further suggest that the time of eye and body reorientation is dependent on the temporal rather than spatial visual cues, i.e. visually specified estimation time to contact with the virtual corner. these results indicate that gaze redirection is a prerequisite for the initiation of a pre-programmed steering synergy and suggest that these robust postural responses are intimately linked to the oculomotor control processes within the central nervous system. a fundamental property of the human brain is the ability to make predictions of future sensory and motor events. we have recently found that steering manoeuvres when walking along curvilinear trajectories are controlled by an anticipatory guidance of the direction of head (and eyes). however it is unclear whether a time-related or space-related signal triggers such anticipatory head orienting movements. by simulating navigation along a multi-legged virtual corridor we show that anticipatory orienting movements are triggered (in standing subjects) by reaching specific locations rather than by the time to the approaching corridor's bend. similar to what happens in car driving, specific spatial features of the route rather than time to collision seem to drive steering.
the flash-lag effect refers to the phenomenon in which a flash adjacent to a continuously moving object is perceived to lag behind it. to test three previously proposed hypotheses (motion extrapolation, positional averaging, and differential latency), a new stimulus configuration, to which the three hypotheses give different predictions, was introduced. instead of continuous motion, a randomly jumping bar was used as the moving stimulus, relative to which the position of the flash was judged. the results were visualized as a spatiotemporal correlogram, in which the response to a flash was plotted at the space-time relative to the position and onset of the jumping bar. the actual human performance was not consistent with any of the original hypotheses. however, all the results were explained well if the differential latency was assumed to fluctuate considerably, its probability density function being approximated by gaussian. also, the model fit well with previously published data on the flash-lag effect. a flash that is presented aligned with a moving stimulus appears to lag behind the position of the moving stimulus. this flash-lag phenomenon reflects a processing advantage for moving stimuli (metzger, w. (1932) psychologische forschung 16, 176-200; mackay, d. m. (1958) nature 181, 507-508; nijhawan, r. (1994) nature 370, 256-257; purushothaman, g., patel, s.s., bedell, h.e., & ogmen, h. (1998) nature 396, 424; whitney, d. & murakami, i. (1998) nature neuroscience 1, 656-657). the present study measures the sensitivity of the illusion to unpredictable changes in the direction of motion. a moving stimulus translated upwards and then made a 90 degrees turn leftward or rightward. the flash-lag illusion was measured and it was found that, although the change in direction was unpredictable, the flash was still perceived to lag behind the moving stimulus at all points along the trajectory, a finding that is at odds with the extrapolation hypothesis (nijhawan, r. (1994) nature 370, 256-257). the results suggest that there is a shorter latency of the neural response to motion even during unpredictable changes in direction. the latency facilitation therefore appears to be omnidirectional rather than specific to a predictable path of motion (grzywacz, n. m. & amthor, f. r. (1993) journal of neurophysiology 69, 2188-2199).
with large-scale production and wide application of nano-titanium oxide (tio2), its health hazard has attracted extensive attention worldwide. in this study, mouse macrophages (ana-1 and mh-s cells) were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of different sized tio2 nanoparticles. the results showed that tio2 nanoparticles caused low toxicity, especially in mh-s cells. there was a difference in the cytotoxicity induced by different sized tio2 particles. the 25 nm anatase particles induced the strongest cytotoxicity and oxidative stress, followed by 5 and 100 nm anatase particles; in contrast, 100 nm rutile particles induced the lowest toxicity. although tio2 nanoparticles induced high levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ros), the determination of ros demonstrated that the inherent oxidative capacity of tio2 nanoparticles was lower in the absence of photoactivation. therefore, the generation of intracellular ros could not completely depend on inherent oxidative capacity of tio2 nanoparticles. toxicity of tio2 nanoparticles could mainly depend on the structural characteristics. nanotitanium dioxide (tio2) is an important industrial material that is widely used as an additive in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and food colorants. although the small size of the tio2 nanoparticle is useful in various applications, the biosafety of this material needs to be evaluated. in this study, mouse fibroblast (l929) cells were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of different concentrations (3-600 microg/ml) of homogeneous and weakly aggregated tio2 nanoparticles in aqueous solution. the l929 cells became round and even shrank as the concentration of tio2 nanoparticles increased. moreover, tio2 nanoparticle-treated cells had condensed fragmented chromatin or were directly necrosed, as observed by acridine orange (ao) staining. the transmission electron microscopy (tem) analysis showed that in cells cultured in a medium containing 300 microg/ml tio2, the number of lysosomes increased, and some cytoplasmic organelles were damaged. in addition, there was a significant increase in oxidative stress at higher tio2 nanoparticle concentrations (>60 microg/ml). as the concentration of tio2 nanoparticles increased in the culture medium, the levels of reactive oxygen species (ros) and lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) increased, while those of methyl tetrazolium cytotoxicity (mtt), glutathione (gsh), and superoxide dismutase (sod) decreased. a possible mechanism for the cytotoxicity of tio2 nanoparticles is also discussed.
the therapeutic activity of selective serotonin (5-ht) reuptake inhibitors (ssris) relies on long-term adaptation at pre- and post-synaptic levels. the sustained administration of ssris increases the serotonergic neurotransmission in response to a functional desensitization of the inhibitory 5-ht1a autoreceptor in the dorsal raphe. at nerve terminal such as the hippocampus, the enhancement of 5-ht availability increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) synthesis and signaling, a major event in the stimulation of adult neurogenesis. in physiological conditions, bdnf would be expressed at functionally relevant levels in neurons. however, the recent observation that ssris upregulate bdnf mrna in primary cultures of astrocytes strongly suggest that the therapeutic activity of antidepressant drugs might result from an increase in bdnf synthesis in this cell type. in this study, by overexpressing bdnf in astrocytes, we balanced the ratio between astrocytic and neuronal bdnf raising the possibility that such manipulation could positively reverberate on anxiolytic-/antidepressant-like activities in transfected mice. our results indicate that bdnf overexpression in hippocampal astrocytes produced anxiolytic-/antidepressant-like activity in the novelty suppressed feeding in relation with the stimulation of hippocampal neurogenesis whereas it did not potentiate the effects of the ssri fluoxetine on these parameters. moreover, overexpressing bdnf revealed the anxiolytic-like activity of fluoxetine in the elevated plus maze while attenuating 5-ht neurotransmission in response to a blunted downregulation of the 5-ht1a autoreceptor. these results emphasize an original role of hippocampal astrocytes in the synthesis of bdnf, which can act through neurogenesis-dependent and -independent mechanisms to regulate different facets of anxiolytic-like responses. preclinical data support the view that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) and serotonergic systems regulate circuits involved in affective disorders. the present study examined neurochemical and behavioural consequences of an acute intrahippocampal injection of bdnf combined with an antidepressant by using in-vivo intracerebral microdialysis in the ventral hippocampus (vhi) in conscious mice and behavioural paradigms predictive of antidepressant and anxiolytic-like effects [the mouse forced swim test (fst), the open-field (of) paradigm and the elevated plus maze (epm)]. neurochemical data revealed that bdnf (100 ng) potentiated the effects of the systemic administration of a serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor (ssri; paroxetine 4 mg/kg i.p.) and that of a locally applied citalopram perfusion on dialysate 5-ht levels in the vhi. these neurochemical changes correlated with behavioural data since, in the fst, antidepressant-like activity of paroxetine as measured on swimming behaviour was potentiated by bdnf. these data suggest an interesting synergy between bdnf and ssri on antidepressant-like activity. furthermore, in both the of and epm paradigms bdnf induced an anxiogenic-like activity, whereas paroxetine prevented this effect. finally, the neurochemical and behavioural effects of bdnf on the serotonergic system might occur at both pre- and post-synaptic levels since by using in-situ hybridization, we showed that trkb-r mrna was expressed in the hippocampus and the dorsal raphe nucleus in adult mice. taken together the neurochemical and behavioural effects of bdnf suggest that these behavioural changes were mediated by increases in 5-ht neurotransmission in vhi. thus a bdnf+ssri combination may offer new alternatives to treat mood disorders.
two significant barriers have limited the development of effective treatment of alzheimer's disease. first, for many cases the aetiology is unknown and likely multi-factorial. among these factors, hypercholesterolemia is a known risk predictor and has been linked to the formation of β-amyloid plaques, a pathological hallmark this disease. second, standardized diagnostic tools are unable to definitively diagnose this disease prior to death; hence new diagnostic tools are urgently needed. magnetic resonance imaging (mri) using high field-strength scanners has shown promise for direct visualization of β-amyloid plaques, allowing in vivo longitudinal tracking of disease progression in mouse models. here, we present a new rabbit model for studying the relationship between cholesterol and alzheimer's disease development and new tools for direct visualization of β-amyloid plaques using clinical field-strength mri. new zealand white rabbits were fed either a low-level (0.125–0.25% w/w) cholesterol diet (n = 5) or normal chow (n = 4) for 27 months. high-resolution (66 × 66 × 100 µm3; scan time = 96 min) ex vivo mri of brains was performed using a 3-tesla (t) mr scanner interfaced with customized gradient and radiofrequency coils. β-amyloid-42 immunostaining and prussian blue iron staining were performed on brain sections and mr and histological images were manually registered. mri revealed distinct signal voids throughout the brains of cholesterol-fed rabbits, whereas minimal voids were seen in control rabbit brains. these voids corresponded directly to small clusters of extracellular β-amyloid-positive plaques, which were consistently identified as iron-loaded (the presumed source of mr contrast). plaques were typically located in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, striatum, hypothalamus and thalamus. quantitative analysis of the number of histologically positive β-amyloid plaques (p < 0.0001) and mr-positive signal voids (p < 0.05) found in cholesterol-fed and control rabbit brains corroborated our qualitative observations. in conclusion, long-term, low-level cholesterol feeding was sufficient to promote the formation of extracellular β-amyloid plaque formation in rabbits, supporting the integral role of cholesterol in the aetiology of alzheimer's disease. we also present the first evidence that mri is capable of detecting iron-associated β-amyloid plaques in a rabbit model of alzheimer's disease and have advanced the sensitivity of mri for plaque detection to a new level, allowing clinical field-strength scanners to be employed. we believe extension of these technologies to an in vivo setting in rabbits is feasible and that our results support future work exploring the role of mri as a leading imaging tool for this debilitating and life-threatening disease. beta-amyloid and alz-50 immunocytochemical reactivity were determined in the brains of rabbits fed either a control or 2% cholesterol diet. control rabbits demonstrated no accumulation of intracellular immunolabeled beta-amyloid within 3 min after death. in animals fed the experimental diet for 4, 6, and 8 weeks (postmortem interval < 3 min), there was an increasingly mild-to-moderate-to-severe accumulation of intracellular immunolabeled beta-amyloid. whether or not beta-amyloid is causally linked to processes leading to dementia, it is related in some way to the prime cause of human death; heart disease. hypercholesterolemic rabbits may provide an animal model to study altered beta-app metabolism leading to alzheimer-like beta-amyloid accumulation xe03and extracellular deposition in brain.
the rosaceae conserved orthologous set (roscos) provides a gene-based genome-wide set of markers that have been used in comparative analyses of peach (prunus persica), apple (malus × domestica), and strawberry (fragaria spp.). in order to extend the use of these roscos to sweet cherry (prunus avium l.), we identified markers that are polymorphic in breeding germplasm. ninety-five percent (595/627) of previously designed roscos primer pairs amplified a product in six sweet cherry cultivars predicted to represent the range of genetic diversity in breeding germplasm. a total of 45% (282/627) roscos were polymorphic among the six cultivars, and allele number ranged from 2 to 6, with a genome-wide mean of 2.35. a subset of 92 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) corresponding to 76 roscos was analyzed in 36 founder accessions and progeny. the expected and observed heterozygosity suggested that 83% of the roscos were in hardy–weinberg equilibrium, implying that most roscos behave as neutral markers. principal coordinate analysis (pco) identified one wild accession and two spanish landraces that clustered differently from the other accessions. the relatively high number of unique alleles found in the three differentially clustered selections suggested that their use as parents has potential to increase the genetic diversity in future us-bred cultivars. of the 92 roscos snps, 81 snps that represented 68 genome-wide roscos segregated in four mapping populations. these roscos were mapped in four f1 populations, thereby greatly improving the genetic linkage map of sweet cherry. backgrounddomestication and breeding involve the selection of particular phenotypes, limiting the genomic diversity of the population and creating a bottleneck. these effects can be precisely estimated when the location of domestication is established. few analyses have focused on understanding the genetic consequences of domestication and breeding in fruit trees. in this study, we aimed to analyse genetic structure and changes in the diversity in sweet cherry prunus avium l.resultsthree subgroups were detected in sweet cherry, with one group of landraces genetically very close to the analysed wild cherry population. a limited number of ssr markers displayed deviations from the frequencies expected under neutrality. after the removal of these markers from the analysis, a very limited bottleneck was detected between wild cherries and sweet cherry landraces, with a much more pronounced bottleneck between sweet cherry landraces and modern sweet cherry varieties. the loss of diversity between wild cherries and sweet cherry landraces at the s-locus was more significant than that for microsatellites. particularly high levels of differentiation were observed for some s-alleles.conclusionsseveral domestication events may have happened in sweet cherry or/and intense gene flow from local wild cherry was probably maintained along the evolutionary history of the species. a marked bottleneck due to breeding was detected, with all markers, in the modern sweet cherry gene pool. the microsatellites did not detect the bottleneck due to domestication in the analysed sample. the vegetative propagation specific to some fruit trees may account for the differences in diversity observed at the s-locus. our study provides insights into domestication events of cherry, however, requires confirmation on a larger sampling scheme for both sweet cherry landraces and wild cherry.
for decision makers and researchers working in a technical domain, understanding the state of their area of interest is of the highest importance. for this reason, we consider in this chapter, a novel framework for web-based technology forecasting using bibliometrics (i.e. the analysis of information from trends and patterns of scientific publications). the proposed framework consists of a few conceptual stages based on a data acquisition process from bibliographic online repositories: extraction of domainrelevant keywords, the generation of taxonomy of the research field of interests and the development of early growth indicators which helps to find interesting technologies in their first phase of development. to provide a concrete application domain for developing and testing our tools, we conducted a case study in the field of renewable energy and in particular one of its subfields: waste-to-energy (w2e). the results on this particular research domain confirm the benefit of our approach. doi: 10.4018/978-1-61350-038-5.ch008 renewable energy (re) technologies are increasingly viewed as critically important since the noticeable depletion of fossil fuel. knowledge that facilitates forecasting the likely growth and consequences of emergent technologies is essential for well-informed technology management. acquiring and analyzing such knowledge is hampered by the amount of data available in publications. in order to elucidate the advance of technologies, we want to address questions like: “how many scientific articles have been published in solar energy recently?” intelligent search techniques capable of grouping semantically similar concepts are therefore needed, such that e.g. the term ”parabolic trough” is subsumed under solar energy related technologies and hence articles about it should be included in the analysis. the novelty of this work is the deployment of a large, high quality re-taxonomy for comprehensive trend discovery in publications and patents. we report interesting trends of renewables in two case studies: power generation and desalination techniques. while all major renewables — except geothermal-recently boomed in power generation in terms of publication volume, leading to a nearly equibalanced diversification, patents only reflect strong growth for wind and solar. renewables in desalination, in particular reverse osmosis, are mainly solar and wind with a slight upward trend of biofuels in publications, hereas other renewables are still in experimental stage.
sporotrichosis is a chronic infection caused by the dimorphic fungus sporothrix schenckii, involving all layers of skin and the subcutaneous tissue. the role of innate immune toll-like receptors 2 and 4 in the defense against this fungus has been reported, but so far, there were no studies on the effect of cell wall major components over the cytosolic oligo-merization domain (nod)-like receptors, important regulators of inflammation and responsible for the maturation of il-1β and il-18, whose functions are dependents of the caspase-1 activation, that can participate of inflammasome. it was evaluated the percentage of activation of caspase-1, the production of il-1β, il-18, il-17, ifn-γ and nitric oxide in a balb/c model of s. schenckii infection. it was observed a decreased activity of caspase-1 during the fourth and sixth weeks of infection accompanied by reduced secretion of the cytokines il-1β, il-18 and il-17 and high production of nitric oxide. ifn-γ levels were elevated during the entire time course of infection. this temporal reduction in caspase-1 activity coincides exactly with the reported period of fungal burden associated with a transitory immunosuppression induced by this fungus and detected in similar infection models. these results indicate the importance of interaction between caspase-1, cytokines il-1β and il-18 in the host defense against s. schenckii infection, suggesting a participation the inflammasome in this response. production of interleukin-1 (il-1) and tumor necrosis factor (tnf) by adherent peritoneal cells from balb/c mice was measured at week 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 after intravenous inoculation with 10(6) sporothrix schenckii yeasts. as compared with age-matched controls, il-1 and tnf production by adherent peritoneal cells from s. schenckii-infected mice was reduced severely at week 4 and 6 of infection and greater than normal at week 8 and 10. moreover, between week 4 and 6 of infection there was a depression of delayed type hypersensitivity response to a specific whole soluble antigen, and an increase in fungal multiplication in the livers and spleens of infected mice. thus, the deficits of cell-mediated immunity in mice with systemic s. schenckii infection may derive, in part, from impaired amplification of the immune response consequent to abnormal generation of il-1 and tnf.
changing light and copper conditions jointly regulate the expression of a large cohort of genes; the microrna mir408 plays a pivotal role in this regulation. light and copper are important environmental determinants of plant growth and development. despite the wealth of knowledge on both light and copper signaling, the molecular mechanisms that integrate the two pathways remain poorly understood. here, we use arabidopsis thaliana to demonstrate an interaction between squamosa promoter binding protein-like7 (spl7) and elongated hypocotyl5 (hy5), which mediate copper and light signaling, respectively. through whole-genome chromatin immunoprecipitation and rna sequencing analyses, we elucidated the spl7 regulon and compared it with that of hy5. we found that the two transcription factors coregulate many genes, including those involved in anthocyanin accumulation and photosynthesis. moreover, spl7 and hy5 act coordinately to transcriptionally regulate mir408, which results in differential expression of microrna408 (mir408) and its target genes in response to changing light and copper conditions. we demonstrate that this regulation is tied to copper allocation to the chloroplast and plastocyanin levels. finally, we found that constitutively activated mir408 rescues the distinct developmental defects of the hy5, spl7, and hy5 spl7 mutants. these findings revealed the existence of crosstalk between light and copper, mediated by a hy5-spl7 network. furthermore, integration of transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation is critical for governing proper metabolism and development in response to combined copper and light signaling. the binding of the sbp domain of crr1 to copper response elements of target promoters in vitro is blocked by cu(ii) or hg(ii), which also deactivate transcription in vivo. mutagenesis of the sbp domain implicates a conserved his residue in interaction with copper ions, suggesting a mechanism for copper sensing. a metallothionein-like domain at the crr1 c terminus is implicated in zinc homeostasis. copper response regulator 1 (crr1), an sbp-domain transcription factor, is a global regulator of nutritional copper signaling in chlamydomonas reinhardtii and activates genes necessary during periods of copper deficiency. we localized chlamydomonas crr1 to the nucleus in mustard (sinapis alba) seedlings, a location consistent with its function as a transcription factor. the zn binding sbp domain of crr1 binds copper ions in vitro. cu(i) can replace zn(ii), but the cu(ii) form is unstable. the dna binding activity is inhibited in vitro by cu(ii) or hg(ii) ions, which also prevent activation of transcription in vivo, but not by co(ii) or ni(ii), which have no effect in vivo. copper inhibition of dna binding is reduced by mutation of a conserved his residue. these results implicate the sbp domain in copper sensing. deletion of a c-terminal metallothionein-like cys-rich domain impacted neither nutritional copper signaling nor the effect of mercuric supplementation, but rendered crr1 insensitive to hypoxia and to nickel supplementation, which normally activate the copper deficiency regulon in wild-type cells. strains carrying the crr1-δcys allele upregulate zrt genes and hyperaccumulate zn(ii), suggesting that the effect of nickel ions may be revealing a role for the c-terminal domain of crr1 in zinc homeostasis in chlamydomonas.
abstract. the complete nucleotide sequence of the 18s subunit of ribosomal dna (rdna) was determined for the venerid clams callista chione (pitarinae) and venus verrucosa (venerinae). comparison of the new sequences with the published sequences of 1 annelid, 2 gastropods, 2 polyplacophorans, and 19 bivalves showed that when the annelids are used as outgroup the gastropods diverge from the bivalves, which form a cluster including the polyplacophorans. when the gastropods alone were compared with the bivalves, the latter split in two groups corresponding to the two subclasses of heterodonta and pteriomorpha. the former include two taxa that diverged early, galeomma and tridacna, while the veneridae and mactridae form two sister groups. in contrast to previous reports and in line with morphological data, the ostreidae are included in the pteriomorphia and form a monophyletic group. in the july (1996) issue of journal of molecular evolution, steiner and mu ̈ller (1996) discuss the limitations of 18s rdna sequences to achieve a ‘‘reasonable’’ phylogeny of bivalve mollusks. after a nice introduction to the subject and thorough references to molecular techniques applied to bivalvia, they collect 21 18s rdna sequences published to date—2 polyplacophora, 3 gastropoda, and 16 bivalvia belonging to the filibranchia (4pteriomorphia) and eulamelibranchia ( 4heterodonta)—plus 2 new sequences (both also filibranchia). eight of these sequences, however, were excluded from the main analyses. two more partial sequences were not included: one cephalopoda and one polyplacophora (wheeler et al. 1993). different tree-constructing algorithms, based on parsimony, neighbor-joining, and maximum-likelihood, as well as other methods, to test the reliability of the clades, such as the prn and spectral analysis were used. the results obtained led them to propose a ‘‘preferred tree (their fig. 9) combining the results from the 18s rdna data and morphological characters compiled by waller (1978, 1990).’’ in their words, this tree ‘‘is not a computer-constructed tree but an evaluation of hypotheses on bivalve phylogeny from the given morphological and molecular trees.’’ moreover ‘‘the failure of neighbor-joining and parsimony to resolve this clade [bivalvia]’’ is probably due to the different substitution rates among species. we have reanalyzed the data set presented by steiner and müller (1996), to which we added 12 more molluscan sequences available via genbank. sequence alignments were generated using clustalw (thompson et al. 1996), with subsequent manual correction based on secondary structure constraints. two alignments were analyzed, one with the whole data set and another in which four ambiguous-alignment zones corresponding to loops were removed. alignments are available at the ftp site porthos.bio.ub.es/users/ftp/pub/teu/18sphylogeny. parsimony analyses were performed with paup 3.1.1 (swofford 1993). analyses were run for both alignments, using unweighted and weighted parsimony at different transition/transversion rates (3 and 5), as well as using transversion parsimony (transitions downweighted to 0). gaps were treated in two ways, as missing data or as a fifth state. three independent data sets were analyzed: the 13 taxa analyzed in the original paper (data set 1), the 21 taxa reported in their table 2 (data set 2), and all molluscan sequences published to date (data set 3). all the analyses run with data sets 2 and 3 rendered bivalvia monophyletic (figs. 1b and c) with an internal unstable topology, varying depending on the analysis condition. the following clades above family level are always monophyletic: pectinidae, arca+ pectinidae, ostreidae, mytilidae, mactridae, and the two represented eulamelibranchia groups ( mya + mactridae). the paraphyletic bivalvia have only been recovered in some cases when data set 1 was used for the analyses (fig. 1a). although the internal topology differs slightly from their fig. 4, the two gastropoda also cluster with the two mactridae, which are the longest branches of the tree. these results clearly indicate that the paraphyletic bivalvia is an artifact, most likely due to the low number of taxa used in the analyses, combined with the long branch attraction effect among the gastropoda and the mactridae. simulations have demonstrated that adding large numbers of additional taxa to phylogenetic analyses may increase the accuracy of the estimated trees, reduce the long branch attraction effect, and, at the same time, reduce the need for computationally complex methods of analysis (hillis 1996). in our case, solely increasing the umber of taxa from 13 to 21 is enough to obtain a robust monophyletic bivalvia clade. from these results we suggest that computational efforts in phylogenetic analysis should focus on analyzing the biggest available data sets instead of performing more costly computational methods (e.g., the prn and spectral analyses) with fewer taxa. the failure of recovering a reliable internal phylogeny j mol evol (1999) 48:256–261
we used a behavioral learning paradigm followed by electrophysiological analysis to find sites in thelymnaea feeding network in which electrical changes could be recorded after appetitive conditioning. specifically, we analyzed conditioning-induced changes in cellular responses in the mechanosensory conditioned stimulus (cs) pathway, in the central pattern generator (cpg) network, and in feeding motoneurons. during training, experimental animals received 15 pairings of lip touch (the cs) with sucrose (the unconditioned stimulus, us). control animals received 15 random cs and us presentations. electrophysiological tests on semi-intact preparations made from conditioned animals demonstrated a network correlate of the overall feeding conditioned response, a touch-evoked cpg-driven fictive feeding rhythm. at the motoneuronal level, we found significant conditioning-induced increases in the amplitude of an early touch-evoked epsp and spike activity, recorded from the b3 feeding motoneuron. increases in epsp amplitude and motoneuronal spike activity could occur independently of conditioned fictive feeding. these changes in response recorded at the level of cpg interneurons, and motoneurons were preceded by changes recorded in the cs pathway. this was demonstrated by recording a conditioning-induced increase in the number of touch-evoked spikes in the cerebrobuccal connective, which forms part of the cs pathway. the finding that electrophysiological changes after conditioning can be recorded at multiple sites in this simple system provided an important intermediate level of analysis between whole animal behavior and cellular studies on the synaptic sites of plasticity. in vitro appetitive classical conditioning of the feeding response in the pond snail lymnaea stagnalis. j. neurophysiol. 78: 2351-2362, 1997. an in vitro preparation was developed that allowed electrophysiological analysis of appetitive conditioning of feeding in the model molluscan system, lymnaea. the network generating the feeding motor program (fictive feeding) is well characterized at the cellular level and consists of identified central pattern generator (cpg) interneurons, motor neurons, and modulatory interneurons. activation of a modulatory interneuron, the slow oscillator (so), evokes the three-phase fictive feeding rhythm in the same semi-intact preparations where tactile stimuli can be applied to the lips. by pairing touch as a conditioned stimulus (cs) with stimulation of the so as an unconditioned stimulus (us), we established an effective in vitro paradigm for appetitive conditioning. before training, touch to the lips evoked only brief and weak activity in the feeding interneurons and motor neurons. after 6-10 conditioning trials, there was a significant enhancement in the fictive feeding response to cs alone. this was not seen in controls (cs only, us only, random cs and us) and in preparations where there was no initial brief response to touch before conditioning. direct recordings from the protraction phase n1m interneurons during in vitro conditioning indicated that the enhancement of the fictive feeding is due to an increased activation of these cpg cells by mechanosensory inputs from the lips. we also found that the conditioned response was not due to a facilitated activation of modulatory neurons in the feeding network, such as the so or the cerebral giant cells (cgcs), because the activity of these cells remained unchanged after conditioning.
skeletal muscle atrophy and whole-body glucose intolerance are consequences of muscle disuse associated with conditions leading to prolonged bed rest. nutritional supplementation with chromium has been shown to prevent weight loss and improve glucose tolerance in malnourished subjects on long-term total parenteral nutrition. the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of oral supplementation with a novel chromium complex, chromium (d-phenylalanine)(3) [cr(d-phe)(3)] at 45 microg/kg/day for 5 weeks, on skeletal muscle atrophy and glucose intolerance in a hindlimb suspension mouse model. hindlimb-suspended mice exhibited reduced skeletal muscle fiber size and enhanced whole-body glucose intolerance, both of which were reversed by chromium treatment. the inhibition of skeletal muscle atrophy by chromium was associated with reductions in the ubiquitination ligase atrogin-1/muscle atrophy f-box, which is elevated in hindlimb-suspended mice. neither hindlimb suspension nor chromium treatment altered the protein levels of the myostatin, phospho-forkhead box o-1 and mammalian target of rapamycin. chromium-treated animals exhibited elevated akt (homo sapiens v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog) phosphorylation in their skeletal muscle, with no change observed in the levels of activated jnk (c-jun n-terminal kinase). thus, these data suggest that nutritional supplementation with chromium may have potential therapeutic benefits in minimizing skeletal muscle atrophy associated with long periods of muscle disuse. skeletal muscle atrophy is a debilitating response to fasting, disuse, cancer, and other systemic diseases. in atrophying muscles, the ubiquitin ligase, atrogin-1 (mafbx), is dramatically induced, and this response is necessary for rapid atrophy. here, we show that in cultured myotubes undergoing atrophy, the activity of the pi3k/akt pathway decreases, leading to activation of foxo transcription factors and atrogin-1 induction. igf-1 treatment or akt overexpression inhibits foxo and atrogin-1 expression. moreover, constitutively active foxo3 acts on the atrogin-1 promoter to cause atrogin-1 transcription and dramatic atrophy of myotubes and muscle fibers. when foxo activation is blocked by a dominant-negative construct in myotubes or by rnai in mouse muscles in vivo, atrogin-1 induction during starvation and atrophy of myotubes induced by glucocorticoids are prevented. thus, forkhead factor(s) play a critical role in the development of muscle atrophy, and inhibition of foxo factors is an attractive approach to combat muscle wasting.
controlling classical swine fever (csf) mainly involves vaccination with live attenuated vaccines (lav). experimental csfv lavs has been lately developed through reverse genetics using several different approaches. here we present that codon de-optimization in the major csfv structural glycoprotein e2 coding region, causes virus attenuation in swine. four different mutated constructs (pcsfm1-pcsfm4) were designed using various mutational approaches based on the genetic background of the highly virulent strain brescia (bicv). three of these constructs produced infectious viruses (csfm2v, csfm3v, and csfm4v). animals infected with csfm2v presented a reduced and extended viremia but did not display any csf-related clinical signs. animals that were infected with csfm2v were protected against challenge with virulent parental bicv. this is the first report describing the development of an attenuated csfv experimental vaccine by codon usage de-optimization, and one of the few examples of virus attenuation using this methodology that is assessed in a natural host. abstract exploring the utility of de novo gene synthesis with the aim of designing stably attenuated polioviruses (pv), we followed two strategies to construct pv variants containing synthetic replacements of the capsid coding sequences either by deoptimizing synonymous codon usage (pv-ab) or by maximizing synonymous codon position changes of the existing wild-type (wt) poliovirus codons (pv-sd). despite 934 nucleotide changes in the capsid coding region, pv-sd rna produced virus with wild-type characteristics. in contrast, no viable virus was recovered from pv-ab rna carrying 680 silent mutations, due to a reduction of genome translation and replication below a critical level. after subcloning of smaller portions of the ab capsid coding sequence into the wt background, several viable viruses were obtained with a wide range of phenotypes corresponding to their efficiency of directing genome translation. surprisingly, when inoculated with equal infectious doses (pfu), even the most replication-deficient viruses appeared to be as pathogenic in pv-sensitive cd155tg (transgenic) mice as the pv(m) wild type. however, infection with equal amounts of virus particles revealed a neuroattenuated phenotype over 100-fold. direct analysis indicated a striking reduction of the specific infectivity of pv-ab-type virus particles. due to the distribution effect of many silent mutations over large genome segments, codon-deoptimized viruses should have genetically stable phenotypes, and they may prove suitable as attenuated substrates for the production of poliovirus vaccines.
purpose the purpose of this study was to evaluate the measured dimensions of the normal glenoid on sagittal magnetic resonance (mr) imaging to determine whether a fixed ratio of glenoid length and width can be determined.   methods mr images of 90 glenoids in 84 patients were analyzed. the mean age was 54.8 years, with 44 male and 40 female patients. glenoid length and width at the widest dimension were measured and recorded by 3 independent examiners. the ratio of length to width and the ratio of the length of the superior pole at the widest point to the total length were calculated. intraclass correlation coefficients, spearman and pearson correlations, regression analysis with cross validation, and coefficients of variation were calculated.   results the mean glenoid length was 37.5 ± 3.8 mm, whereas the mean width was 24.4 ± 2.9 mm. the mean ratio of length to width was 1.55 ± 0.1, whereas the mean ratio of the distance from the superior pole to the widest point to the total glenoid length was 0.64 ± 0.03. the calculated ratios were less variable than the absolute length and width. cross validation of length for width showed a 95% prediction band width of 4.48 mm, with an average absolute error of prediction of 1.46 mm, and was equally specific when separated by gender. the width was equal to 0.65 times the length.   conclusions measurement of glenoid length and width using mr imaging results in a consistent ratio of length to width independent of patient age and gender, where the width was equal to 0.65 times the length at a point two-thirds along the inferosuperior axis.   level of evidence level iv, case series. we measured the dimensions of the humeral and glenoid articular surfaces in 140 shoulders that were representative of a given population of patients, and also evaluated several glenohumeral relationships. ninety-six measurements were made in the shoulders of cadavera and forty-four, on magnetic resonance-imaging studies of living patients. eighty-five per cent of the humeral measurements fell within eight fixed combinations of the radius of curvature and the thickness of the humeral head, in two-millimeter increments. the average radius of curvature of the humeral head in the coronal plane was 24 +/- 2.1 millimeters (range, nineteen to twenty-eight millimeters). the average thickness of the humeral head was 19 +/- 2.4 millimeters (range, fifteen to twenty-four millimeters). there was a wide variability in the size of the humeral head and a direct correlation between the differences in size and the heights in both men and women. the humeral articular surface was spherical in the center; however, the peripheral radius was two millimeters less in the axial plane than in the coronal plane. thus, the peripheral contour of the articular surface was elliptical (ratio, 0.92). the radius of curvature of the glenoid, measured in the coronal plane, was an average of 2.3 +/- 0.2 millimeters greater than that of the humeral head. the average dimensions of the glenoid in the superior-inferior and anterior-posterior (lower half) directions were 39 +/- 3.5 millimeters (range, thirty to forty-eight millimeters) and 29 +/- 3.2 millimeters (range, twenty-one to thirty-five millimeters). the anterior-posterior dimension of the glenoid was pear-shaped, the lower half being larger than the top half. the ratio of the lower half to the top half was 1:0.80 +/- 0.01. there was a strong linear correlation between the lateral humeral offset and the size of the humeral head (radius of curvature and thickness). the average lateral humeral offset was 56 +/- 5.7 millimeters (range, forty-three to sixty-seven millimeters). the superior most point on the humeral articular surface was an average of 8 +/- 3.2 millimeters (range, three to twenty millimeters) cephalad to the top of the greater tuberosity. our data show that reconstruction of the lateral humeral offset is important in optimization of the moment arm of the deltoid and rotator cuff and of the normal tension of the soft tissue after prosthetic reconstruction.
in this preliminary study we explored the predictive influence of various family, psychological, demographic, and neurobiological characteristics on the persistence of antisocial behaviour in adolescence. existing data were combined with case-records in a sample of 47 disruptive behaviour disordered (dbd) children who had been treated in in-patient and/or day-treatment units when they were between seven to 12 years old. parent-rated and self-rated externalizing problem scores and the presence of a dbd diagnosis served as the outcome measures in adolescence. we used linear regression analyses to examine the predictors of adolescent outcome. a lower basal skin conductance level (scl) was repeatedly found to predict poor adolescent outcome, either when rated by parents or by participants themselves. in addition, comorbid attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, one aspect of performance on the door-opening task, and a mother of low socioeconomic status also predicted that a child would have more antisocial problems in adolescence, depending on the type of outcome measure. results of this study support the fearlessness theory, according to which low activity of the autonomous nervous system, as manifested by low scl, is related to the effectiveness of socializing punishment and accordingly to poor socialization and adolescent outcome. objective to clarify the developmental risk associated with hyperactive behavior, especially the relationship between hyperactive and conduct problems, in a longitudinal epidemiological design.   method a follow-up study of children who were identified, by parent and teacher ratings in a large community survey of 6- and 7-year-olds, as showing pervasive hyperactivity or conduct problems or the comorbid mixture of both problems or neither problem. they were later investigated, at the age of 16 to 18 years, with detailed interview techniques as well as parental and self-report ratings and cognitive tests.   results hyperactivity was a risk factor for later development, even allowing for the coexistence of conduct problems. its sequelae included a high likelihood of psychiatric diagnosis, persisting hyperactivity, violence and other antisocial behaviors, and social and peer problems.   conclusions the results suggested a developmental pathway through which hyperactivity raised the likelihood of impaired social adjustment, including the development of psychiatric disorders, independently of the existence of conduct problems.
introduction secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine (sparc) is a matricellular protein involved in many biological processes and found over-expressed in cirrhotic livers. by mean of a genetic approach we herein provide evidence from different in vivo liver disease models suggesting a profibrogenic role for sparc. methods two in vivo models of liver fibrosis, based on taa administration and bile duct ligation, were developed on sparc wild-type (sparc+/+) and knock-out (sparc−/−) mice. hepatic sparc expression was analyzed by qpcr. fibrosis was assessed by sirius red staining, and the maturation state of collagen fibers was analyzed using polarized light. necroinflammatory activity was evaluated by applying the knodell score and liver inflammatory infiltration was characterized by immunohistochemistry. hepatic stellate cell activation was assessed by α-sma immunohistochemistry. in addition, pro-fibrogenic genes and inflammatory cytokines were measured by qpcr and/or elisa. liver gene expression profile was analyzed in sparc−/− and sparc+/+ mice using affymetrix mouse gene st 1.0 array. results sparc expression was found induced in fibrotic livers of mouse and human. sparc−/− mice showed a reduction in the degree of inflammation, mainly cd4+ cells, and fibrosis. consistently, collagen deposits and mrna expression levels were decreased in sparc−/− mice when compared to sparc+/+ mice; in addition, mmp-2 expression was increased in sparc−/− mice. a reduction in the number of activated myofibroblasts was observed. moreover, tgf-β1 expression levels were down-regulated in the liver as well as in the serum of taa-treated knock-out animals. ingenuity pathway analysis (ipa) analysis suggested several gene networks which might involve protective mechanisms of sparc deficiency against liver fibrogenesis and a better established machinery to repair dna and detoxify from external chemical stimuli. conclusions overall our data suggest that sparc plays a significant role in liver fibrogenesis. interventions to inhibit sparc expression are suggested as promising approaches for liver fibrosis treatment. the matricellular protein secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (sparc) modulates cell adhesion, proliferation, matrix deposition, and tissue remodeling. sparc has been shown to regulate the expression of collagen type i and transforming growth factor-beta1 in mesangial cells and to be highly expressed during tubulointerstitial fibrosis in rat angiotensin (ang) ii infusion models. we hypothesized that sparc is a downstream effector of ang ii and that loss of host sparc function provides a protective effect on renal damage and fibrosis associated with ang ii hypertension. our results revealed that cultured primary mesangial cells displayed a concentration-dependent increase in sparc expression in response to ang ii. after a 14-day chronic infusion of ang ii, hypertensive sparc-null mice exhibited significantly attenuated levels of urinary and renal indicators of oxidative stress and inflammation and decreased renal perivascular and tubulointerstitial fibrosis relative to wild-type hypertensive controls. moreover, the observed renal protective changes in sparc-null mice were found to be independent of blood pressure. these results identify sparc as an effector of ang ii signaling and suggest an important role for sparc in mediating ang ii-induced oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis.
in male caucasian subjects, learning is facilitated by receipt of social compared with non‐social feedback, and the neuropeptide oxytocin (oxt) facilitates this effect. in this study, we have first shown a cultural difference in that male chinese subjects actually perform significantly worse in the same reinforcement associated learning task with social (emotional faces) compared with non‐social feedback. nevertheless, in two independent double‐blind placebo (plc) controlled between‐subject design experiments we found oxt still selectively facilitated learning with social feedback. similar to caucasian subjects this oxt effect was strongest with feedback using female rather than male faces. one experiment performed in conjunction with functional magnetic resonance imaging showed that during the response, but not feedback phase of the task, oxt selectively increased activity in the amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus and putamen during the social feedback condition, and functional connectivity between the amygdala and insula and caudate. therefore, oxt may be increasing the salience and reward value of anticipated social feedback. in the plc group, response times and state anxiety scores during social feedback were associated with signal changes in these same regions but not in the oxt group. oxt may therefore have also facilitated learning by reducing anxiety in the social feedback condition. overall our results provide the first evidence for cultural differences in social facilitation of learning per se, but a similar selective enhancement of learning with social feedback under oxt. this effect of oxt may be associated with enhanced responses and functional connectivity in emotional memory and reward processing regions. hum brain mapp 36:2132–2146, 2015. © 2015 wiley periodicals, inc. the neuropeptide oxytocin is involved in the development and maintenance of attachment behaviours in humans and other species. little is known, however, about how it affects judgements of unfamiliar others. in a double-blind placebo-controlled study we investigated the effect of a single intranasal dose of oxytocin on judgements of facial trustworthiness and attractiveness. we found that oxytocin administration increased ratings of trustworthiness and attractiveness of male and female targets in raters of both sexes relative to control ratings, suggesting that higher levels of this neuropeptide may enhance affiliative behaviour towards unfamiliar others. our results provide evidence in support of a general facilitative role of oxytocin in promoting positive trait judgements.
this study examined motor competence (mc) behavior in 6- to 14-year-old children, and investigated the differences in health-related fitness (hrf) between high and low mc groups, according to sex and age. a sample of 564 children (288 males) participated in this study, divided into three age groups (6–8 years; 9–11 years; 12–14 years). total mc and its three components (stability, locomotor, and manipulative) were assessed with a quantitative instrument. hrf was evaluated using a maximal multistage 20-m shuttle-run test and the handgrip test. participants were divided into tertiles according to their mc level and high and low mc groups were analyzed. overall, mc increased across age groups for both sexes, but boys presented better results than girls. the high mc group outperformed their low mc peers in all hrf variables, independent of their age group. although cardiovascular fitness increased with age for both the high and low mc groups, the differences between these groups were greater in older children compared to younger children, within the study age range. the findings suggest that mc interventions should be considered as an important strategy to enhance hrf, and girls at a young age should be a priority target. children with low motor competence (lmc) are less able to participate fully in many sports and recreational activities typically enjoyed by their well-coordinated peers. poor fitness outcomes have been reported for these children, although previous studies have not tracked these outcomes over time. in this study, 19 children (8 girls and 11 boys) with lmc aged between 5 and 7years were matched by age and gender with 19 children with high motor competence (hmc). six fitness (body composition and cardiovascular endurance) and motor skill (sprint run, standing broad jump and balance) measures were repeated for each group once a year for five years. for each year of the study, the lmc groups performed less well on all measures than the hmc groups. changes over time were significantly different between groups for cardiovascular endurance, 50-m run and balance, but not for body composition, overhand throw or standing broad jump. between the two groups, performances were significantly different for all measures, except body composition. these findings confirm the impact of lmc on fitness measures and skill performances over time.
pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience usually triggered by stimulation of peripheral nerves and often associated with actual or potential tissue damage. it is well known that pain perception for patients and normal subjects can be modulated by psychological factors, such as attention, stress, and arousal. our understanding of how this modulation occurs at a neuroanatomical level is poor. here we neuroanatomically defined a key area in the network of brain regions active in response to pain that is modulated by attention to the painful stimulus. high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to define brain activation to painful heat stimulation applied to the hand of nine normal subjects within the periaqueductal gray region. subjects were asked to either focus on or distract themselves from the painful stimuli, which were cued using colored lights. during the distraction condition, subjects rated the pain intensity as significantly lower compared with when they attended to the stimulus. activation in the periaqueductal gray was significantly increased during the distraction condition, and the total increase in activation was predictive of changes in perceived intensity. this provides direct evidence supporting the notion that the periaqueductal gray is a site for higher cortical control of pain modulation in humans. electrical brain stimulation is effective in controlling certain intractable chronic pain syndromes in humans, but the specific target site(s) for stimulation producing a maximal analgesic effect is (are) not well defined. this prospective study correlates the clinical results of chronic stimulation of the periaqueductal gray (pag) and periventricular gray (pvg) matter in humans with the anatomic site of electrode placement as determined at autopsy, and documents the histologic reactions to electrode implantation and electrical stimulation of the area. seven patients underwent electrode implantation to control their chronic pain; two had electrodes implanted bilaterally. all patients obtained complete analgesia with stimulation, although 3 subsequently found the stimulation to have diminished efficacy. the opiate antagonist naloxone reversed the analgesia in the 4 patients so tested. all 7 patients later died of causes unrelated to electrode implantation or stimulation. postmortem analysis showed that, for 6 of the 9 electrodes implanted, the electrode tip was located in the ventrolateral pag at the level of the posterior commissure; the other 3 electrodes were found in the white matter adjacent to the pag. no evidence of gliosis or parenchymal reaction was observed along the tracts and tips of the electrodes. the results indicate that the ventrolateral pag and pvg matter at the level of the posterior commissure is the optimal site for therapeutic electrical brain stimulation for opiate-responsive pain in humans.
the grass colpodium versicolor (stev.) schmalh is one of six angiosperms with extremely reduced chromosome set 2n = 2x = 4. the chromosome complement of this species was studied. the dna methylation pattern was determined with a specific monoclonal antiboby. 5-methylcytosine residues are present in different chromosomal sites, with specific occurrence, some methylated bands showing differences between homologous chromosomes. moreover, a fluorescent in situ hybridisation with telomere repeats and 45s rdna sequences were performed. hybridisation signals of telomeric repeats are detectable at the distal ends of the two pair of chromosomes, while 45s rdna is localised in one chromosomal site, corresponding to the secondary constriction. in addition, 45s rdna, as well as telomere-associated sequences, results to be 5-methylcytosine-enriched. the results are discussed and compared with those previously obtained in other plant systems 2n = 4 with the aim to enable a better knowledge of the lengthwise differentiation of this chromosome complement. summary.haplopappus gracilis (nutt.) gray, one of the five known higher plants with a chromosome number of 2n = 4, was studied from a cytological point of view. the chromosome complement of this species was characterized by means of automated karyotype analysis. moreover, the dna methylation pattern and fluorochrome banding were determined and compared with cytological data present in the literature. dna methylation distribution along metaphase chromosomes involved all chromosome territories evidenced by c-banding. other methylated bands correlated positively with aceto-orcein-positive heterochromatic portions and/or with late replicating bands and/or fluorochrome bands. some methylated bands showed differences between homologous chromosomes. these bands belonged partly to certain heterochromatic domains and partly to intercalary sites not defined by other standard banding techniques. differences between the homologues were also indicated by our dna content data obtained after dnase i digestion.
methods: a total of thirty-one hemiplegic stroke patients were included in this study and randomly assigned into case and control groups. both groups received four weeks conventional physical therapy interventions and balance training exercises. during balance training, the case group received visual biofeedback, whereas the control group did not receive visual information. balance performance of stroke patients were examined quantitatively using the equi-test testing system and biodex stability system, walking performance was evaluated by timed up and go tests, and the patients were assessed using the modified barthel index for activities of daily living. data were collected before starting, during, and after completion of the rehabilitation program. repeated measure analyses of variance were performed to evaluate rehabilitation effects and independent samples t tests were done to quantify the effects of visual biofeedback. results: no significant differences between the groups were detected in any of the outcome variables after completion of the program. noticeable improvements were found in dynamic balance function, mobility, and activities of daily living of both groups, whereas no statistically significant improvements were found in static balance after rehabilitation. conclusion: both rehabilitation protocols created advances in the postural control system of stroke patients. visual biofeedback balance training did not produce extra advantage for balance ability of participants who received this treatment program in comparison with those who were treated without visual biofeedback. the results showed that dynamical tasks scores and activitybased measures better than static balance measures reflect the recovery effects. a b s t r a c t objective to examine the physiologic and functional recovery of standing balance and health-related quality of life (hrqol) in people after mild and moderate stroke.   design inception cohort study with evaluations at 1 month and 3 months poststroke.   setting laboratory.   participants twenty-nine volunteers who had sustained a stroke. subjects were categorized into mild and moderate groups.   interventions not applicable.   main outcome measures functional balance was assessed (clinical outcome variables scale [covs]) and physiologic measures (electromyography, postural sway) were taken when subjects stood quietly on a force platform and when they performed a rapid unilateral arm-raise perturbation. the medical outcomes study 36-item short-form health survey (sf-36) was administered to evaluate hrqol.   results subjects in the mild group were approaching maximal scores on the covs (87.7+/-4.1/91) at 3 months poststroke, yet had significant impairment in paretic muscle activation patterns when compared with healthy subjects. subjects in the moderate group had increased paretic muscle activation over the 2 months, accompanied by significant increases of 10.7+/-5.9 points on the covs. for both groups, there was significantly less postural sway on the paretic than the nonparetic leg and significant improvements in the sf-36 (physical component) over time.   conclusions subjects recovering from a stroke showed a significant improvement in physical hrqol and functional and physiologic balance, yet the physiologic balance recovery was not complete even in the mild group.
the relationships between exercise and metabolites as well as between exercise and sarcoplasmic reticulum function were studied in gastrocnemius muscle of ovariectomized-trained rats. prolonged moderate-intensity exercise, treadmill up-hill run for 90 min with a 10 degree incline, decreased the muscle glycogen content. exercise until exhaustion further lowered the glycogen concentration to 13% of the control, together with a significant decrease of atp and glucose-6-phosphate concentrations. also, ag+-induced ca2+ release, measured in whole muscle homogenate, showed a 30% reduction on exhaustion, while ca2+ uptake was unaffected by this exercise. atpase activities, of both homogenate and sr vesicles, and ca2+ transport in the latter preparation were not altered on exhaustion. it could be concluded from these results that muscular fatigue in ovariectomized rats after aerobic exercise is caused by the change in energy supply and ca2+ release from the sr, this latter possibly due to metabolites generated by the exercise. sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) ca2+ uptake and ca2+-mg2+-atpase activity were examined in muscle homogenates and the purified sr fraction of the superficial and deep fibers of the gastrocnemius and vastus muscles of the rat after treadmill runs of 20 or 45 min or to exhaustion (avg time to exhaustion 140 min). vesicle intactness and cross-contamination of isolated sr were estimated using a calcium ionophore and mitochondrial and sarcolemmal marker enzymes, respectively. present findings confirm previously reported fiber-type specific depression in the initial rate and maximum capacity of ca2+ uptake and altered atpase activity after exercise. depression of the ca2+-stimulated atpase activity of the enzyme was evident after greater than or equal to 20 min of exercise in sr isolated from the deep fibers of these muscles. the lowered atpase activity was followed by a depression in the initial rate of ca2+ uptake in both muscle homogenates and isolated sr fractions after greater than or equal to 45 min of exercise. maximum ca2+ uptake capacity was lower in isolated sr only after exhaustive exercise. ca2+ uptake and ca2+-sensitive atpase activity were not affected at any duration of exercise in sr isolated from superficial fibers of these muscles; however, the mg2+-dependent atpase activity was increased after 45 min and exhaustive exercise bouts. the alterations in sr function could not be attributed to disrupted vesicles or differential contamination in the sr from exercise groups and were reinforced by similar changes in ca2+ uptake in crude muscle homogenates.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
autoimmune hemolytic anemia (aiha) is a recognized complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (hsct); it is often refractory to treatment and carries a high mortality. to improve understanding of the incidence, risk factors, and clinical outcome of post-transplantation aiha, we analyzed 533 patients who received allogeneic hsct, and we identified 19 cases of aiha after hsct (overall incidence, 3.6%). the median time to onset, from hsct to aiha, was 202 days. aiha was associated with hsct from unrelated donors (hazard ratio [hr], 5.28; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.22 to 22.9; p = .026). in the majority (14 of 19; 74%) of aiha patients, multiple agents for treatment were required, with only 9 of 19 (47%) patients achieving complete resolution of aiha. patients with post-transplantation aiha had a higher overall mortality (hr, 2.48; 95% ci, 1.33 to 4.63; p = .004), with 36% (4 of 11 cases) of deaths attributable to aiha. we reviewed the medical records of 293 patients who underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplants at the hammersmith hospital between 1989 and 1994. there was clinical evidence of an autoimmune reaction against red cells in nine patients. seven of these patients had significant haemolysis; the other two had red cell auto-agglutination. haemolysis was resistant to treatment in three cases. six of the nine patients had monoclonal ig bands identified within 1 year of transplant. the autoimmune reaction could be classified broadly into two types: an early onset type (n = 4) beginning 2 to 8 months post-transplant associated with a cold antibody, and a late onset type (n = 5) beginning 6 to 18 months post-transplant associated with warm antibodies. the predominant antibody in the two categories described may reflect the kinetics of immune reconstitution post-transplant, since serum igm levels typically return to normal 2 to 6 months post-transplant, while igg levels may not reach normal levels until 12–18 months post-transplant. we speculate that unbalanced reconstitution of b and t cell lymphopoiesis post-transplant may favour emergence of oligoclonal proliferation and that some of the resulting antibodies may have activity against red cells.
in mammals, the corpus luteum (cl) is an essential endocrine gland for the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. if pregnancy is not established, the cl regresses and disappears rapidly from the ovary. a possible explanation for the rapid disappearance of the cl is that luteal cells are transported from the ovary via lymphatic vessels. here, we report the presence of cells positive for 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-hsd), an enzyme involved in progesterone synthesis, in the lumen of lymphatic vessels at the regressing luteal stage and in the lymphatic fluid collected from the ovarian pedicle ipsilateral to the regressing cl. the 3β-hsd positive cells were alive and contained lipid droplets. the 3β-hsd positive cells in the lymphatic fluid were most abundant at days 22–24 after ovulation. these findings show that live steroidogenic cells are in the lymphatic vessels drained from the cl. the outflow of steroidogenic cells starts at the regressing luteal stage and continues after next ovulation. the overall findings suggest that the complete disappearance of the cl during luteolysis is involved in the outflow of luteal cells from the cl via ovarian lymphatic vessels. abstract corpora lutea removed at various times during the estrous cycle were studied after no treatment, treatment with oxytocin, oxytocin and hcg, oxytocin and bovine lh, and with hcg alone. these studies supported a hypothesis that luteal cells are derived from both granulosa and theca interna layers of the follicle. the granulosa-derived luteal cells develop into functioning luteal cells by about day 4 of the estrous cycle, after which they undergo no further divisions. therefore, granulosa-derived cells have limited potential. however, the smaller luteal cells derived from the theca interna respond to plasma luteotropin, multiply and grow into large luteal cells. these are mainly responsible for growth of the corpus luteum following day 4. there was luteinization of the theca interna and granulosa layers of the follicles shortly before ovulation and in anovulatory (cystic) follicles. the collapse of the follicle and growth of the corpus luteum were described, with special emphasis on the patterns of mitotic activity before and after stimulation with exogenous luteotropin and on progesterone concentrations and contents. growth and degeneration of a luteal cell were described.
background sortilin, a member of the vps10p-domain receptor family, has been demonstrated a key regulator in mediating cellular response to pro-neurotrophins. in the present study, we investigated the role of sortilin in the apoptotic pathway of vascular smooth muscle cells. methods and principal findings immunohistochemistry revealed that sortilin was barely detectable in human and rat normal young vessels, while its expression was increased in human fibroatheromatous plaques. sortilin immunodetection was also marked in the neointima of the rat aorta fifteen days after ballooning. in vitro, rat aortic intimal cells expressed higher sortilin levels than normal media smcs; sortilin was distributed in the cytoplasm and in correspondence of the cell membrane. after 48 h, pro-nerve growth factor (prongf) induced the strong dose-dependent increase of intimal cell apoptosis and the accumulation of sortilin protein. prongf was a more potent apoptotic inducer than equimolar or even higher concentration of ngf, whereas brain derived neutrotrophic factor was ineffective. targeted interfering rna-mediated sortilin reduction counteracted prongf-induced apoptosis without affecting p75ntr expression. prongf-induced apoptosis was associated to nf-κb down-regulation and bax increase. inhibition of nf-κb activity increased intimal cell apoptosis that did not further increase with the addition of prongf. conclusions our results indicate that sortilin expression characterizes human atheromatous lesions and rat aortic post-injury neointima, and suggest that sortilin represents an important regulator of prongf-induced smc apoptosis and arterial remodeling. neurotrophins are growth factors that promote cell survival, differentiation, and cell death. they are synthesized as proforms that can be cleaved intracellularly to release mature, secreted ligands. although proneurotrophins have been considered inactive precursors, we show here that the proforms of nerve growth factor (ngf) and the proforms of brain derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) are secreted and cleaved extracellularly by the serine protease plasmin and by selective matrix metalloproteinases (mmps). prongf is a high-affinity ligand for p75ntr with high affinity and induced p75ntr-dependent apoptosis in cultured neurons with minimal activation of trka-mediated differentiation or survival. the biological action of neurotrophins is thus regulated by proteolytic cleavage, with proforms preferentially activating p75ntr to mediate apoptosis and mature forms activating trk receptors to promote survival.
exercise has numerous beneficial metabolic effects. the central nervous system (cns) is critical for regulating energy balance and coordinating whole body metabolism. however, a role for the cns in the regulation of metabolism in the context of the exercise remains less clear. here, using genetically engineered mice we assessed the requirement of steroidogenic factor-1 (sf-1) expression in neurons of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (vmh) in mediating the beneficial effects of exercise on metabolism. we found that vmh-specific deletion of sf-1 blunts (a) the reductions in fat mass, (b) improvements in glycemia, and (c) increases in energy expenditure that are associated with exercise training. unexpectedly, we found that sf-1 deletion in the vmh attenuates metabolic responses of skeletal muscle to exercise, including induction of pgc-1α expression. collectively, this evidence suggests that sf-1 expression in vmh neurons is required for the beneficial effects of exercise on metabolism. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/elife.18206.001 phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (pi3k) signaling in the hypothalamus has been implicated in the regulation of energy homeostasis, but the critical brain sites where this intracellular signal integrates various metabolic cues to regulate food intake and energy expenditure are unknown. here, we show that mice with reduced pi3k activity in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (vmh) are more sensitive to high-fat diet-induced obesity due to reduced energy expenditure. in addition, inhibition of pi3k in the vmh impaired the ability to alter energy expenditure in response to acute high-fat diet feeding and food deprivation. furthermore, the acute anorexigenic effects induced by exogenous leptin were blunted in the mutant mice. collectively, our results indicate that pi3k activity in vmh neurons plays a physiologically relevant role in the regulation of energy expenditure.
although there is a sizable amount of research focusing on adult neural progenitor cells (npcs) as a therapeutic approach for many neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple sclerosis, little is known about the pathways that govern npc survival and apoptosis. fas, a member of the death receptor superfamily, plays a well‐characterized role in the immune system, but its function in neural stem cells remains uncertain. our study focuses on the effects of fas on npc survival in vitro. activation of fas by recombinant fas ligand (fasl) did not induce apoptosis in murine npcs in culture. in fact, both an increase in the amount of viable cells and a decrease in apoptotic and dying cells were observed with fasl treatment. our data indicate that fasl‐mediated adult npc neuroprotection is characterized by a reduction in apoptosis, but not increased proliferation. further investigation of this effect revealed that the antiapoptotic effects of fasl are mediated by the up‐regulation of birc3, an inhibitor of apoptosis protein (iap). conversely, the observed effect is not the result of altered caspase activation or flip (fas‐associated death domain‐like interleukin‐1beta‐converting enzyme inhibitory protein) up‐regulation, which is known to inhibit caspase‐8‐mediated cell death in t cells. our data indicate that murine adult npcs are resistant to fasl‐induced cell death. activation of fas increased cell survival by decreasing apoptosis through birc3 up‐regulation. these results describe a novel pathway involved in npc survival. © 2009 wiley‐liss, inc. the potential of pluripotent embryonic stem (es) cells to develop into functional cells or tissue provides an opportunity in the development of new therapies for many diseases including neurodegenerative disorders. the survival of implanted cells usually requires systemic immunosuppression, however, which severely compromises the host immune system, leading to complications in clinical transplantation. an optimal therapy would therefore be the induction of specific tolerance to the donor cells, while otherwise preserving functional immune responses. fas ligand (fasl) is expressed in activated lymphocytes as well as cells in “immune‐privileged” sites including the central nervous system. its receptor, fas, is expressed on various immune‐reactive cell types, such as activated natural killer and t cells, monocytes, and polymorphic mononucleocytes, which can undergo apoptosis upon interaction with fasl. to render transplanted cells tolerant to host cellular immune responses, we genetically engineered mouse es cells to express rat fasl (rfasl). the rfasl‐expressing es cells were analyzed for survival during in vitro neurodifferentiation and after transplantation to the rat brain without further immunosuppression. although control transfected hek‐293t cells expressed functional rfasl, immature and differentiated mouse es cells did not express the recombinant rfasl surface protein. furthermore, there was no evidence for functional endogenous fas and fasl expression on either es cells or on neural cells after in vitro differentiation. moreover, implanted rfasl‐engineered es cells did not survive in the rat brains in the absence of the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporine a. our results indicate that immature and differentiated mouse es cells do not express a functional fas/fasl system.
the morphological characteristics of the humeral bone has been investigated in recent times with studies showing varying degrees of sexual dimorphism. osteologists and forensic scientists have shown that sex determination methods based on skeletal measurements are population specific, and these population-specific variations are present in many body dimensions. the present study aims to establish sex identification using osteometric standards for the humerus in a contemporary kwazulu-natal population. a total of 11 parameters were measured in a sample of n=211 humeri (males, 113; females, 98) from the osteological collection in the discipline of clinical anatomy, nelson r. mandela school of medicine, university of kwazulu-natal, durban, south africa. the difference in means for nearly all variables were found to be significantly higher in males compared to females (p<0.01) with the most effective single parameter for predicting sex being the vertical head diameter having an accuracy of 82.5%. stepwise discriminant analysis increased the overall accuracy rate to 87.7% when all measurements were jointly applied. we conclude that the humerus is an important bone which can be reliably used for sex determination based on standard metric methods despite minor tribal or ancestral differences amongst an otherwise homogenous population. determination of sex from the skeleton is vital to medicolegal investigations. there is no longer any question that populations differ in size and proportions and these differences affect the metric assessment of sex. the extent of variation in sexual dimorphism among asian mongoloids within and between regions has not been quantified by discriminant function analysis, nor have standards for most groups been introduced for the humerus. therefore, the purpose of this research is to establish metric standards for sex determination from the humerus of chinese, japanese and thais, as well as to compare size and sexual dimorphism in these asian mongoloid populations. the database for this study consisted of documented skeletal samples from china (n = 87), japan (n = 90), and thailand (n = 104). six standard dimensions, including maximum length, vertical head diameter, minimum midshaft diameter, maximum midshaft diameter, midshaft circumference, and epicondylar breadth were taken and subjected to stepwise and direct discriminant function analysis. of dimensions selected by the stepwise function, vertical head diameter and epicondylar breadth were the only elements common to all three groups. overall, mean accuracies were highest using formulae produced by the stepwise procedure and ranged from 86.8% in the chinese to 92.4% in the japanese to 97.1% in the thais. group comparisons also revealed that while the chinese had the largest measurements, they were the least dimorphic. the reverse was true for the thais and the japanese were intermediate on both counts. in cross validation tests, classification accuracy decreased in all cases where a formula from one group was applied to another. it was therefore concluded even though all individuals were asian mongoloids, these regionally diverse populations exhibited significant metric differences that affect sex determination from the skeleton. these findings confirm those of previous studies that there is a need for group specific metric standards of assessment.
we report the development of a new technology for simultaneous quantitative detection of multiple targets in a single sample. scalable transcriptional analysis routine (star) represents a novel integration of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and capillary electrophoresis that allows detection of dozens of gene transcripts in a multiplexed format using amplicon size as an identifier for each target. star demonstrated similar or better sensitivity and precision compared to two commonly used methods, sybr green-based and taqman probe-based real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. star can be used as a flexible platform for building a variety of applications to monitor gene expression, from single gene assays to assays analyzing the expression level of multiple genes. using severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) corona virus as a model system, star technology detected single copies of the viral genome in a two-gene multiplex. blinded studies using rna extracted from various tissues of a sars-infected individual showed that star correctly identified all samples containing sars virus and yielded negative results for non-sars control samples. using alternate priming strategies, star technology can be adapted to transcriptional profiling studies without requiring a priori sequence information. thus, star technology offers a flexible platform for development of highly multiplexed assays in gene expression analysis and molecular diagnostics. we describe a multiplex nucleic acid assay that identifies and determines the abundance of four different pathogenic retroviruses (hiv-1, hiv-2, and human t-lymphotrophic virus types i and ii). retroviral dna sequences are amplified in a single, sealed tube by simultaneous pcr assays, and the resulting amplicons are detected in real time by the hybridization of four differently colored, amplicon-specific molecular beacons. the color of the fluorescence generated in the course of amplification identifies which retroviruses are present, and the number of thermal cycles required for the intensity of each color to rise significantly above background provides an accurate measure of the number of copies of each retroviral sequence that were present originally in the sample. fewer than 10 retroviral genomes can be detected. moreover, 10 copies of a rare retrovirus can be detected in the presence of 100, 000 copies of an abundant retrovirus. ninety-six samples can be analyzed in 3 hr on a single plate, and the use of a closed-tube format eliminates crossover contamination. utilizing previously well characterized clinical samples, we demonstrate that each of the pathogenic retroviruses can be identified correctly and no false positives occur. this assay enables the rapid and reliable screening of donated blood and transplantable tissues.
asthma and other allergic diseases are continuously increasing, causing considerable economic and sociologic burden to society. the hygiene hypothesis proposes that lack of microbial t helper (th) 1-like stimulation during early childhood leads to increased th2-driven allergic disorders later in life. immunostimulatory cytosine-phosphate-guanosine (cpg)-oligodeoxynucleotide motifs are candidate molecules for immunotherapeutic studies, as they have been shown to shift the th2 response toward the th1 direction and reduce allergic symptoms. using natural rubber latex (nrl)-induced murine model of asthma, we demonstrated that intradermal cpg administration with allergen reduced pulmonary eosinophilia, mucus production, and th2-type cytokines, but unexpectedly induced airway hyperreactivity (ahr) to inhaled methacholine, one of the hallmarks of asthma. we found that induction in ahr was dependent on stat4, but independent of stat6 signaling. cpg treatment increased production of ifn-γ in the airways and shifted the ratio of cd4(+):cd8(+) t cells toward cd8(+) dominance. by blocking soluble ifn-γ with neutralizing antibody, ahr diminished and the cd4(+):cd8(+) ratio returned to cd4(+) dominance. these results indicate that increased production of ifn-γ in the lungs may lead to severe side effects, such as enhancement of bronchial hyperreactivity to inhaled allergen. this finding should be taken into consideration when planning prophylaxis treatment of asthma with intradermal cpg injections. allergic asthma is a complex syndrome characterized by airway obstruction, airway inflammation and airway hyper-responsiveness (ahr). using a mouse model of allergen-induced ahr, we previously demonstrated that cd8-deficient mice develop significantly lower ahr, eosinophilic inflammation and interleukin (il)-13 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid compared with wild-type mice. these responses were restored by adoptive transfer of antigen-primed cd8+ t cells. previously, two distinct populations of antigen-experienced cd8+ t cells, termed effector (teff) and central memory (tcm) cells, have been described. after adoptive transfer into cd8-deficient mice, teff, but not tcm, cells restored ahr, eosinophilic inflammation and il-13 levels. teff, but not tcm, cells accumulated in the lungs, and intracellular cytokine staining showed that the transferred teff cells were a source of il-13. these data suggest an important role for effector cd8+ t cells in the development of ahr and airway inflammation, which may be associated with their tc2-type cytokine production and their capacity to migrate into the lung.
the objective of this study was to analyze the proliferative response of balb/c mice lymphocytes after in vitro irradiation (0.05 to 6 gy). the capability of irradiated lymphocytes for proliferating without any stimulation and after activation with specific t and b cell mitogens has been evaluated. the results show that ionizing radiation significantly inhibits spontaneous cellular proliferation and that induced by mitogens and that variations in the degree of inhibition are found depending on the inducing proliferation mitogens and the dosage applied. the conclusion drawn is that different lymphocyte populations have different radiosensitivities, being b cells more sensitive to ionizing irradiation than t cells. besides, the effects of gamma-irradiation vary according to the different subpopulations of t cells or, alternatively, to different t-dependent activation mechanisms.resumenel objetivo de este estudio fue analizar la respuesta proliferativa de linfocitos de ratón balb/c después de irradiación in vitro (0.05 to 6 gy). se evaluó la capacidad de los linfocitos irradiados para proliferar sin estímulo y también tras la activación con mitógenos específicos para las células t y b. los resultados mostraron que la radiación ionizante inhibe significativamente la proliferación celular espontánea y la inducida por mitógenos y que las variaciones en el grado de inhibición son dependientes del mitógeno inductor de la proliferación y de la dosis aplicada. se concluye que las diferentes poblaciones linfocitarias tienen diferentes radiosensibilidades. así, las células b son más sensibles a la radiación ionizante que las células t. por otra parte, los efectos de la radiación gamma varían según diferentes subpoblaciones de células t o, alternativamente, según diferentes mecanismos de activación t-dependientes. abstract.human lymphocyte subpopulations differ in their cellular responses to ionizing radiation. to shed light on the molecular basis of this effect, we characterized the transcriptional response to 1 gy x-rays of cd4+ t lymphocytes. of 18,433 genes tested, 102 were modulated more than 1.5-fold. the majority of the strongly activated genes were p53 targets involved in dna repair and apoptosis. the expression of three of these genes was further tested by quantitative rt-pcr in lymphocyte subpopulations [cd4+ and cd8+ t, cd19+ b, cd56+ natural killer cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes (pbls)] from ten adult donors. in contrast to ddb2, tnfrsf10b and bax were differentially modulated among the subpopulations and the pbls, being more activated in irradiated cd19+ b and cd8+ t lymphocytes. the level of bax activation in the various subpopulations correlated with the sensitivity of the cells to radiation, suggesting its possible role in the differential radiosensitivity of hematopoietic cell subsets.
forty-eight 40-wk-old hi-sex laying hens were individually caged in an environmentally controlled house to evaluate the effect of garlic (allium sativum) juice administration on egg production, egg quality, and yolk cholesterol. garlic juice was prepared by blending pealed garlic cloves with distilled water (1:1, w/w). hens were randomly divided into four equal groups; one served as a control and the other three groups were individually gavaged, 3.75 ml, 7.5 ml, or 15 ml garlic juice, three times a week, which respectively represented 0.25, 0.50 and 1% of body weight. egg production was recorded on a daily basis; egg weight, albumen height, albumen and yolk ph, haugh unit, and bacterial count of e. coli-challenged eggs were recorded at day of oviposition (day-1) and after 5 and 10 days of storage at room temperature. yolk cholesterol content was analyzed for five successive weeks. garlic juice increased (p<0.05) egg weight and mass with no change in egg production intensity. garlic juice administration recorded higher (p<0.05) albumen height and improvement in haugh unit. also, eggs from garlic-treated hens recorded lower (p<0.05) albumen and yolk ph when compared to eggs collected from control hens. garlic reduced (p<0.05) the log 10 of bacterial count in egg contents linearly when challenged with e. coli. egg-yolk cholesterol content was not influenced by garlic juice administration. it is concluded that garlic juice improved performance characteristics and may increase egg shelf life as indicated by egg quality improvement and lower bacterial count of e. coli-challenged eggs. the levels of garlic juice used in this study were insufficient to influence egg yolk cholesterol. a total of 2123 eggs obtained from brown leghorn hens (unselected since 1965, isa brown, commercial brown egg layer) and babcock hens (commercial white egg layer) at 32, 50, and 68 wk of age were used to investigate relationships among measures of albumen quality and a functional property of albumen. the eggs were sampled fresh and after storage for 5 and 10 d. at sampling, eggs were weighed and broken, and albumen height, ph, and volume after whipping for 80 s were measured. also, yolks were weighed, dried shells were weighed, and albumen weight was determined by difference. egg weight and the weights of the 3 principal components of the egg all increased with increasing age of the hen, with yolk weights increasing proportionately more. with storage, egg and albumen weights decreased, whereas yolk weight increased. eggs from brown leghorn hens were smallest but had proportionately the largest yolks. albumen height decreased with time in storage, and albumen ph and whipping volume increased. differences between lines suggested that selection has changed the proportion of the yolk, albumen, and shell and has increased albumen height. albumen height and whipping volume were negatively correlated, and differences between lines suggest that selection could have decreased the foaming ability of albumen, a principal reason for including eggs in many processed food products.
purpose to examine the effects of exercise intensity on acute changes in endothelial function in lean and obese adults. methods sixteen lean (bmi <25, age 23±3 yr) and 10 obese (bmi >30, age 26±6 yr) physically inactive adults were studied during 3 randomized admissions [control (c, no exercise), moderate-intensity exercise (m, @ lactate threshold (lt)) and high-intensity exercise (h, midway between lt and vo2peak) (30 min)]. endothelial function was assessed by flow-mediated dilation (fmd) at baseline and 1, 2, and 4 h post-exercise. results rm ancova revealed significant main effects for group, time, and group x condition interaction (p<0.05). a diurnal increase in fmd was observed in lean but not obese subjects. lean subjects exhibited greater increases in fmd than obese subjects (p = 0.0005). in the obese group a trend was observed for increases in fmd at 2- and 4-hr after m (p = 0.08). for lean subjects, fmd was significantly elevated at all time points after h. the increase in fmd after h in lean subjects (3.2±0.5%) was greater than after both c (1.7±0.4%, p = 0.015) and m (1.4±0.4%, p = 0.002). fmd responses of lean and obese subjects significantly differed after c and h, but not after m. conclusion in lean young adults, high-intensity exercise acutely enhances endothelial function, while moderate-intensity exercise has no significant effect above that seen in the absence of exercise. the fmd response of obese adults is blunted compared to lean adults. diurnal variation should be considered when examining the effects of acute exercise on fmd. the transient impairment of endothelial function following a high-fat meal is well established. brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (fmd) decreases between 2 and 6 h post ingestion. whether this impairment can be reduced with acute aerobic exercise has not been investigated. the purpose of this study was to investigate if a single sustained aerobic exercise session can counteract the postprandial attenuation in brachial artery fmd associated with the ingestion of a high-fat meal. eight apparently healthy adults (five men, three women), age 25.5 ± 0.8 years, performed three treatment conditions in a counter-balanced design: (1) low-fat meal alone (lfm), (2) high-fat meal alone (hfm), and (3) one session of aerobic exercise presented 2 h after ingesting a high-fat meal (hfm-ex). the examination of brachial artery fmd was performed at baseline and 4 h following the ingestion of the meal for each treatment condition. a 3 × 2 (treatment × time) repeated measures anova exhibited a significant interaction (p = 0.019). preprandial fmds were similar (p = 0.863) among all three treatment conditions. the fmds following the lfm (7.18 ± 1.31%) and hfm-ex (8.72 ± 0.94%) were significantly higher (p = 0.001) than the fmd following the hfm (4.29 ± 1.64%). fmd was significantly elevated above preprandial values following the hfm-ex (5.61 ± 1.54 to 8.72 ± 0.94%, p = 0.005) but was unchanged following the lfm (6.17 ± 0.94 to 7.18 ± 1.31%, p = 0.317) and the hfm (5.73 ± 1.23 to 4.29 ± 1.64%, p = 0.160). these findings suggest that a single aerobic exercise session cannot only counteract the postprandial endothelial dysfunction induced by the ingestion of a high-fat meal, but also increase brachial artery fmd in apparently healthy adults.
in this study, a newly identified avian β-defensin (avbd) orthologue was isolated from chinese painted quail (coturnix chinensis) lung and bone marrow tissues. the complete nucleotide sequence of the gene contained a 204-bp open-reading frame encoding 67 amino acids. homology, characterization, and comparison of the gene with avbd from other avian species confirmed that it was quail avbd9. to analyze and compare the expression pattern of avbd9 in tissues from young and adult quails, layer hens, and broilers, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed using mrna isolated from 21 different tissues. the avbd9 expression pattern distribution was differed among quails of different ages, layer hens, and broilers. it was widely expressed in all the tissues except the trachea, liver, and kidney and was highly expressed in the lung and heart of young quails. similarly, it was widely expressed in all the tissues of adult quails except for the liver, kidney, spleen, thymus, and harderian gland. in layer hens, avbd9 was widely expressed in all the tissues except the trachea, glandular stomach, and cecum. similarly, it was widely expressed in all the tissues of broilers except for the trachea, glandular stomach, rectum, cecum, bone marrow, and cecal tonsil. recombinant avbd9 (ravbd9) was produced and purified by expressing the gene in escherichia coli. additionally, peptide according to quail avbd9 sequence was synthesized, named savbd9. as expected, both ravbd9 and savbd9 exhibited strong bactericidal properties against 11 strains of bacteria, including gram-positive and gram-negative forms. abstractantimicrobial peptides (amps) are essential components of innate immunity in a range of species from drosophila to humans and are generally thought to act by disrupting the membrane integrity of microbes. in order to discover novel amps in the chicken, we have implemented a bioinformatic approach that involves the clustering of more than 420,000 chicken expressed sequence tags (ests). similarity searching of proteins—predicted to be encoded by these est clusters—for homology to known amps has resulted in the in silico identification of full-length sequences for seven novel gallinacins (gal-4 to gal-10), a novel cathelicidin and a novel liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 (leap-2) in the chicken. differential gene expression of these novel genes has been demonstrated across a panel of chicken tissues. an evolutionary analysis of the gallinacin family has detected sites—primarily in the mature amp—that are under positive selection in these molecules. the functional implications of these results are discussed.
increased infestation of weedy rice—a noxious agricultural pest has caused significant reduction of grain yield of cultivated rice (oryza sativa) worldwide. knowledge on genetic diversity and structure of weedy rice populations will facilitate the design of effective methods to control this weed by tracing its origins and dispersal patterns in a given region. to generate such knowledge, we studied genetic diversity and structure of 21 weedy rice populations from sri lanka based on 23 selected microsatellite (ssr) loci. results indicated an exceptionally high level of within-population genetic diversity (he = 0.62) and limited among-population differentiation (fst = 0.17) for this predominantly self-pollinating weed. upgma analysis showed a loose genetic affinity of the weedy rice populations in relation to their geographical locations, and no obvious genetic structure among populations across the country. this phenomenon was associated with the considerable amount of gene flow between populations. limited admixture from structure analyses suggested a very low level of hybridization (pollen-mediated gene flow) between populations. the abundant within-population genetic diversity coupled with limited population genetic structure and differentiation is likely caused by the considerable seed-mediated gene flow of weedy rice along with the long-distance exchange of farmer-saved rice seeds between weedy-rice contaminated regions in sri lanka. in addition to other effective weed management strategies, promoting the application of certified rice seeds with no weedy rice contamination should be the immediate action to significantly reduce the proliferation and infestation of this weed in rice ecosystems in countries with similar rice farming styles as in sri lanka. apart from their significance in genetic conservation, barley landraces are still favoured by local farmers in low-input farming systems. they often perform more predictably under adverse conditions than modern cultivars due to local adaptation. increased seed exchange between farmers may put adaptation of local populations of barley landraces at risk. isozyme markers were used to investigate differentiation and infer gene flow between local populations of barley landrace arabi aswad in northern syria. inferred gene flow decreased exponentially with geographic distance and may imply that seed exchange between farmers is limited to a regional scale and diminishes over longer distance. gene flow seems to be a suitable index for estimating seed exchange in highly inbreeding crop species such as barley. in the future, improved mobility of farmers and extension work may facilitate seed exchange over longer distances, and consequently jeopardise preservation of locally adapted landraces in barley.
plant lignocellulosic biomass, mostly composed of cell walls, is one of the largest, mostly untapped, reserves of renewable carbon feedstock on the planet. energy-rich polysaccharide polymers of plant cell walls can be broken down to produce fermentable sugars used to produce bioethanol. however, the complex structure of plant cell walls, and in particular, the presence of lignin, makes them recalcitrant to enzymatic degradation. reducing this recalcitrance represents a major technological challenge. brachypodium distachyon is an excellent model to identify parameters underlying biomass quality of energy grasses. in this work, we identified a mutant line spa1 with a so far undescribed phenotype combining brittleness with increased elasticity of the internodes. mutant cell walls contain less crystalline cellulose and changes in hemicellulose and lignin quality and quantity. using a dedicated reactor to follow in real-time, the evolution of straw particle size and sugar release during enzymatic digestion, we show that, despite the increased lignin content, the spa1 mutant has a dramatic reduced recalcitrance to saccharification compared to the wt. these observations demonstrate that other parameters besides lignin content are relevant for the improvement of biomass recalcitrance in energy grasses. brachypodium distachyon (brachypodium) has been proposed as a model for grasses, but there is limited knowledge regarding its lignins and no data on lignin-related mutants. the cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (cad) genes involved in lignification are promising targets to improve the cellulose-to-ethanol conversion process. down-regulation of cad often induces a reddish coloration of lignified tissues. based on this observation, we screened a chemically induced population of brachypodium mutants (bd21-3 background) for red culm coloration. we identified two mutants (bd4179 and bd7591), with mutations in the bdcad1 gene. the mature stems of these mutants displayed reduced cad activity and lower lignin content. their lignins were enriched in 8-o-4- and 4-o-5-coupled sinapaldehyde units, as well as resistant inter-unit bonds and free phenolic groups. by contrast, there was no increase in coniferaldehyde end groups. moreover, the amount of sinapic acid ester-linked to cell walls was measured for the first time in a lignin-related cad grass mutant. functional complementation of the bd4179 mutant with the wild-type bdcad1 allele restored the wild-type phenotype and lignification. saccharification assays revealed that bd4179 and bd7591 lines were more susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis than wild-type plants. here, we have demonstrated that bdcad1 is involved in lignification of brachypodium. we have shown that a single nucleotide change in bdcad1 reduces the lignin level and increases the degree of branching of lignins through incorporation of sinapaldehyde. these changes make saccharification of cells walls pre-treated with alkaline easier without compromising plant growth.
abstractobjectivesto establish a dedicated protocol for the three-dimensional (3d) quantification of plaque lipids in apolipoprotein e-deficient (apoe−/−) mice using ex vivo mri.methodsapoe−/− mice were fed a high-fat diet (n = 10) or normal food (n = 10) for 3 months. subsequently, a 3d flash mri sequence was used to view the anatomy of the aortic root in the isolated hearts, where a 3d double-echo two-excitation pulse sequence (dixon sequence) was used to selectively image plaque lipids. the vessel wall, lumen and plaque lipid volumes were quantified by mri and histology for correlation analysis.resultsdixon mri allowed visualisation and accurate quantification of plaque lipids. when comparing the vessel wall, lumen and plaque lipid sizes in the aortic root, bland–altman and linear regression analysis revealed a close correlation between mri results and the histological data both on a slice-by-slice basis and of the volumetric measurements (vessel wall: r2 = 0.775, p < 0.001; vessel lumen: r2 = 0.875; p = 0.002; plaque lipid: r2 = 0.819, p = 0.003).conclusionsthe combination of 3d flash and dixon-sequence mri permits an accurate ex vivo assessment of the investigated plaque parameters in the aortic root of mice, particularly the lipid content.key points• ex vivo mri allows high resolution quantification of plaque parameters in mice  • dixon mri enables visualisation of plaque lipids in the aortic root of mice  • a close correlation between histology and mri quantifies plaque parameters  • preservation of tissue integrity allows additional analysis to be performed  • short measurement time may permit the translation into in vivo measurements specific mri techniques have been used to determine the dimensional and compositional properties of atherosclerotic lesions in carotid endarterectomy tissues. a quantitative comparison of areas of specific features in typical tissue segments was performed using mr images and histologic images. the mean difference for the measurements by the two methods was 4.5% for the total vessel, 5.3% for the internal carotid artery lumen, and 5.0% for the external carotid lumen. for other less abundant components, the mean difference was 14.2%. for direct characterization, individual tissue components were isolated by microdissection and their t1 and t2 relaxation times measured. highly calcified areas typically had rather short t1 (452-837 ms) and short t2 (10.4-18.4 ms). in contrast, regions enriched in lipid had much longer t1 (1,380-1,480 ms) and longer t2 (35.3-49.0 ms). other components such as thrombus had intermediate t1 (1,180 ms) and short t2 (15.4 ms). t2 parametric imaging was used as a complementary approach for segmentation and quantitation of tissue components. in fresh tissue, several different components exhibited different t2 ranges: calcified/solid lipid (13-18 ms). cellular/ecm (9-30 ms), fluid lipid (35-40 ms): fibrous (50-60 ms). these results demonstrate the utility of mri for identifying and quantifying specific components of atherosclerotic plaque ex vivo, and suggest its value for these measurements in vivo as well.
backgroundmaternal obesity alters oocytes and subsequent fetal metabolism. an increasing number of studies have shown that the endoplasmic reticulums (er) or mitochondria have important effects on oocyte quality, but there has been no study of the effect of mitochondria-associated er membranes (mams) on oocyte quality. the present study was designed to assess whether the level of mam and mam-related proteins were different in oocytes from obese and control mice.resultsfirst, oocytes from mice with high-fat-diet (hfd)-induced obesity had higher levels (either greater numbers or a higher proportion for the same numbers) of mam than oocytes from control mice. the abundance of mam-related proteins in oocytes from obese mice was significantly greater at both the messenger rna and protein levels, including inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, type 1 (ip3r1), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, type 2 (ip3r2) and phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 2 (pacs-2). further, there was an increase in mitochondrial ca2+ ([ca2+]m) which was associated with increased apoptosis and compromised cytoplasmic maturation in oocytes from obese mice. down-regulation of mam-related protein ip3r1 in oocytes from obese mice decreased [ca2+]m and apoptosis and improved cytoplasmic maturation but did not reduce the overall mam level. however, down-regulating mam-related protein pacs-2 in oocytes from obese mice did reduce the level of mam and [ca2+]m, which decreased the rate of apoptosis and improved cytoplasmic maturation of oocytes from obese mice.conclusionsit is possible that enriched mam could increase [ca2+]m, and this increase has been found to be associated with increased apoptosis and compromised cytoplasmic maturation in oocytes from obese mice. this finding suggests a novel therapeutic target for obesity-induced oocyte defects. proper function of the endoplasmic reticulum (er) and mitochondria is crucial for cellular homeostasis, and dysfunction at either site has been linked to pathophysiological states, including metabolic diseases. although the er and mitochondria play distinct cellular roles, these organelles also form physical interactions with each other at sites defined as mitochondria-associated er membranes (mams), which are essential for calcium, lipid and metabolite exchange. here we show that in the liver, obesity leads to a marked reorganization of mams resulting in mitochondrial calcium overload, compromised mitochondrial oxidative capacity and augmented oxidative stress. experimental induction of er-mitochondria interactions results in oxidative stress and impaired metabolic homeostasis, whereas downregulation of pacs-2 or ip3r1, proteins important for er-mitochondria tethering or calcium transport, respectively, improves mitochondrial oxidative capacity and glucose metabolism in obese animals. these findings establish excessive er-mitochondrial coupling as an essential component of organelle dysfunction in obesity that may contribute to the development of metabolic pathologies such as insulin resistance and diabetes.
aims/hypothesisit is well documented that melatonin influences insulin secretion mediated by g-protein-coupled melatonin receptor isoforms mt1 and mt2, which are present in rat and human pancreatic islets, as well as in rat insulinoma cells. recent investigations have proven that hyperinsulinaemic goto–kakizaki (gk) rats, which are a rat model of type 2 diabetic rats, and humans have decreased melatonin plasma levels, whereas a streptozotocin-induced rat model of diabetes developed reduced insulin levels combined with increased melatonin levels.methodsplasma levels of glucose, insulin and melatonin as well as rna expression of pineal aanat, hiomt (also known as asmt), insulin receptor, adrenoceptor β1 and the clock genes per1 and bmal1 (also known as arntl) were determined in male and female lew.1ar1-iddm rats as well as in insulin-substituted lew.1ar1-iddm rats.resultssevere hypoinsulinaemia in diabetic lew.1ar1-iddm rats was associated with decreased body weight and increased melatonin plasma levels combined with mainly elevated expression of aanat, hiomt, pineal insulin receptor and adrenoceptor β1. the changes were normalised by insulin substitution. diurnal profiles of plasma melatonin and of antagonistic clock genes per1 and bmal1 were maintained in diabetic and insulin-substituted rats.conclusions/interpretationthe assumed causal relation between elevated melatonin and reduced insulin levels in lew.1ar1-iddm rats is supported by the observation that insulin substitution normalised these changes. further support for this interpretation comes from the observation that in gk rats an increase of plasma insulin was combined with a decrease of plasma noradrenaline (norepinephrine), the most important activator of melatonin synthesis. these relationships between the noradrenergic and insulin pathway support the existence of melatonin–insulin antagonism. experiments were conducted in male rats to study the effects of streptozotocin-induced diabetes on circadian rhythms of (a) plasma corticosterone concentrations; (b) motor activity; and (c) metabolic patterns. animals were entrained to ld cycles of 12:12 hr and fed ad libitum. a daily rhythm of plasma corticosterone concentrations was found in controls animals with peak levels at 2400 hr and low values during the remaining hours. this rhythm was statistically confirmed by the cosinor method and had an amplitude of 3.37 micrograms/100 ml and the acrophase at 100 hr. a loss of the normal circadian variation was observed in diabetic animals, with a nadir at the onset of light period and high values throughout the remaining hours; cosinor analysis of these data showed no circadian rhythm, delete and a higher mean level than controls. as expected, normal rats presented most of their motor activity during the dark period with 80% of total daily activity; the cosinor method demonstrated a circadian rhythm with an amplitude of 60% of the mean level and the acrophase at 0852 hr. both diabetic and control rats showed a similar activity during the light phase, but diabetic animals had less activity than controls during the night and their percentage of total daily activity was similar in both phases of the ld cycle (50% for each one). with the cosinor method we were able to show the persistence of a circadian rhythm in the motor activity of diabetic rats, but with a mesor and amplitude lower than in controls (amplitude rested at 60% of the mean level) and its acrophase advanced to 0148 hr.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
backgroundprostate cancer is the most common non-skin cancer in men and sexual dysfunction is the most frequently reported long-term side effect of prostate cancer surgery or radiation. the aim of this study was to examine the experiences of men with sexual dysfunction and their partners following prostate cancer treatment.methodsmen with sexual dysfunction from either surgical removal or radiation therapy 1-5 years after treatment were interviewed, as well as their partners. a mixed method design was used to determine the lived experience of men with sexual dysfunction. open-ended questions guided the interviews.resultstwenty seven men completed the study with a mean age of 61 years (sd = 8.0; range = 44-77 years). nine partners also participated. the majority of men (92.6%) had surgery. the average time from treatment to the interview was 23.5 months (sd = 11.7). themes were frustration with sexual dysfunction, importance of support and understanding from others, depression and anxiety related to sexual dysfunction, importance of intimacy with partner, factors that impact treatment satisfaction, and education and comprehensive information about sex.conclusionsprostate cancer survivors and partners need accurate information about sexual side effects before during and after treatment. men and partners required individualized help and guidance to manage sexual dysfunction. support and understanding from partners, family, and others was also identified as an important aspect of healing and adjustment after prostate cancer treatment. prostate cancer education/support groups played a key role in helping men and partners gain advocacy, education, and support. psychological problems such as depression and anxiety need to be identified and addressed in men after prostate cancer treatment. men and partners need assistance in understanding and navigating their way through intimacy to move forward with connectedness in their relationship. satisfaction with treatment and with providers is dependent on patient education and understanding of all aspects of prostate cancer treatment including sexual side effects and incontinence. the purpose of this study was to illuminate the experience of living after radical prostatectomy (rp) for localized prostate cancer (lpc). ten men were interviewed after rp. the interview text was qualitatively analyzed using the content analysis. the men suffered from worry, anxiety, and distress, and longed for life as they had lived it before the diagnosis. changes in bodily functions after rp include urine incontinence (ui) and/or erectile dysfunction (ed) making the patient feel like a changed man with a lost sex life, with changes in his intimate relations with his wife, and with lowered self-esteem. most men choose to cope on their own. coping strategies in our study population included finding new areas of interest and a new focus in the present. in the present study, living after rp meant striving to gain control over, and become reconciled with, the new life situation as a changed man living with an altered self.
the pluripotency factor lin28 is a highly conserved protein comprising a unique combination of rna-binding motifs, an n-terminal cold-shock domain and a c-terminal region containing two retroviral-type cchc zinc-binding domains. an important function of lin28 is to inhibit the biogenesis of the let-7 family of micrornas through a direct interaction with let-7 precursors. here, we systematically characterize the determinants of the interaction between lin28 and pre-let-7g by investigating the effect of protein and rna mutations on in vitro binding. we determine that lin28 binds with high affinity to the extended loop of pre-let-7g and that its c-terminal domain contributes predominantly to the affinity of this interaction. we uncover remarkable similarities between this c-terminal domain and the ncp7 protein of hiv-1, not only in terms of primary structure but also in their modes of rna binding. this ncp7-like domain of lin28 recognizes a g-rich bulge within pre-let-7g, which is adjacent to one of the dicer cleavage sites. we hypothesize that the ncp7-like domain initiates rna binding and partially unfolds the rna. this partial unfolding would then enable multiple copies of lin28 to bind the extended loop of pre-let-7g and protect the rna from cleavage by the pre-microrna processing enzyme dicer. several recent studies have provided evidence that lin28, a cytoplasmic rna-binding protein, inhibits the biogenesis of members of the let-7 microrna family at the dicer step in both mammals and caenorhabditis elegans. however, the precise mechanism of inhibition is still poorly understood. here we report on an in vitro study, which combined rnase footprinting, gel shift binding assays, and processing assays, to investigate the molecular basis and function of the interaction between the native let-7g precursor (pre-let-7g) and lin28. we have mapped the structure of pre-let-7g and identified some regions of the terminal loop of pre-let-7g that physically interact with lin28. we have also identified a conformational change upon lin28 binding that results in the unwinding of an otherwise double-stranded region at the dicer processing site of pre-let-7g. furthermore, we showed that a mutant pre-let-7g that displays an open upper stem inhibited pre-let-7g dicer processing to the same extent as lin28. the data support a mechanism by which lin28 can directly inhibit let-7g biogenesis at the dicer processing step.
the inverse priming paradigm can be considered one example which demonstrates the operation of control processes in the absence of conscious experience of the inducing stimuli. inverse priming is generated by a prime that is followed by a mask and a subsequent imperative target stimulus. with "relevant" masks that are composed of the superposition of both prime alternatives, the inverse priming effect is typically larger than with "irrelevant" masks that are free of task-relevant features. we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) to examine the neural substrates that are involved in the generation of inverse priming effects with relevant and irrelevant masks. we found a network of brain areas that is accessible to unconscious primes, including supplementary motor area (sma), anterior insula, middle cingulate cortex, and supramarginal gyrus. activation of these brain areas were involved in inverse priming when relevant masks were used. with irrelevant masks, however, only sma activation was involved in inverse priming effects. activation in sma correlated with inverse priming effects of individual participants on reaction time, indicating that this brain area reflects the size of inverse priming effects on the behavioral level. findings are most consistent with the view that a basic inhibitory mechanism contributes to inverse priming with either type of mask and additional processes contribute to the effect with relevant masks. this study provides new evidence showing that cognitive control operations in the human cortex take account of task relevant stimulus information even if this information is not consciously perceived. masked stimuli (primes) can affect the preparation of a motor response to subsequently presented target stimuli. reactions to the target can be facilitated (straight priming) or inhibited (inverse priming) when preceded by a compatible prime (calling for the same response) and also when preceded by an incompatible prime. several hypotheses are currently under debate. these are the self-inhibition (si) hypothesis, the object-updating (ou) hypothesis, and mask-triggered inhibition (mti) hypothesis. all assume that the initial activation of the motor response is elicited by the prime according to its identity. this activation inevitably leads to straight priming in some cases and the mechanisms involved are undisputed. the hypotheses differ, however, as to why inverse priming occurs. the self-inhibition (si) hypothesis assumes that the motor activation elicited by a prime is automatically followed by an inhibition phase, leading to inverse priming if three conditions are fulfilled: perceptual evidence for the prime has to be sufficiently strong, it has to be immediately removed by the mask, and the delay between the prime and target has to be long enough for inhibition to become effective. the object-updating (ou) hypothesis assumes that inverse priming is triggered by the mask, provided that it contains features calling for the alternative response (i.e. the one contrasting with the response induced by the prime). the mti hypothesis assumes that the inhibitory phase is triggered by each successive stimulus which does not support the perceptual hypothesis provided by the prime. based mostly on our own experiments, we argue that (1) attempts to manipulate the three factors required by the si hypothesis imply changes of other variables and that (2) indeed, other variables seem to affect priming: prime-mask perceptual interaction and temporal position of the mask. these observations are in favor of the mti hypothesis. a limiting factor for all three hypotheses is that inverse priming is larger for arrows than for other shapes, making it doubtful as to what extent the majority of studies on inverse priming, due to their use of arrows, can be generalized to other stimuli.
this is a cross-sectional study of 227 cocaine dependent individuals in six different therapeutic communities (tcs) within a single treatment network in andalusia (spain). the primary aim of the study is to examine the prevalence of lifetime psychiatric comorbidity in this sample using the psychiatric research interview for substance and mental disorders (prism). diagnoses were assessed 15-20 days after admission. the data indicate that more than 65% of the sample experienced a lifetime co-occurring psychiatric comorbidity. substance-induced mood (21.6%) and psychotic (11.5%) disorders were more prevalent in this population than independent mood (12.3%) and psychotic (7.5%) disorders. these data suggest the need to introduce changes in these centers, both in the diagnostic aspects and in the treatment programs. the authors explored the relationship between social phobia and cocaine dependence in 158 individuals entering a pharmacologic treatment trial for cocaine dependence. twenty-two patients met dsm-iii-r criteria for social phobia. the social phobia group was compared with 22 age- and sex-matched cocaine-dependent control subjects. those with social phobia and cocaine dependence were more likely to have additional psychiatric diagnoses and greater symptom severity, more likely to be polysubstance users, and more likely to have developed alcohol dependence at an early age. the authors discuss treatment implications of these data.
background: chemomechanical caries removal system is part of the minimal invasive dentistry; the aim of the study was to compare the amount of bacteria after caries removal with chemomechanical system and conventional rotatory instruments and to test the vickers microhardness and micro-raman analysis of residual dentin after excavation. materials and methods: molars were induced for demineralization, confirmed with diagnodent; streptococcus mutans were inoculated into the cavities and filled. caries removal was performed with rotatory instruments and chemomechanical system; surviving bacteria were cultured for 24 and 48 hours at 37°c. vickers microhardness and micro-raman analysis were tested after excavation. data were analyzed with wilcoxon, continuity correction, odds ratio, anova post hoc tukey test, and spearman correlation. results: demineralization was significantly detectable at 240 hours of incubation; conventional rotatory instruments and chemomechanical caries removal were effective in 19.4%-22.6% and 25.8%-32.3%, respectively. vickers microhardness of chemomechanical system was higher (p < 0.0001) than conventional rotatory instruments and comparable to healthy dentin. micro-raman analysis showed that healthy dentin is correlated to chemomechanical system (r2 = 0.683, p < 0.00001) and drilling with burs (r2 = 0.139, p < 0.00001). conclusion: the chemomechanical system is effective for caries elimination, comparable to conventional rotatory instruments; the remaining vickers microhardness and composition surface tissue are similar to healthy dentin. objectives the usage of minimally invasive procedures and attention to patient comfort are of great importance, especially for dental treatment in small children. this has led to the development of chemomechanical methods for caries removal. the aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of chemomechanical caries removal with that of conventional excavation in reducing the count of the cariogenic flora.   design and setting subjects for this study were chosen from children admitted to dental clinic for restorative procedures under general anaesthesia.   samples and methods twenty-one children (mean age 43.5 +/- 12.0 months) with early childhood caries were included in this study. two primary teeth with comparable degrees of carious destruction were chosen in each child (n = 42) for caries removal with carisolv' or by means of rotary instruments. samples from carious dentine were taken with a sterile scraping instrument, then all softened dentine was removed and a second sample was taken. all samples (n = 84) were serially diluted and plated on two different nutrient agar plates.   results after 24 h of incubation, colony forming units were determined for total bacterial counts and lactobacilli. twelve per cent of the samples from carious dentine contained more than 10(6) bacteria, 23.8% contained more than 10(5) lactobacilli. both methods of caries removal produced a statistically significant reduction in the bacterial counts (p = 0.0001). in at least 90.5% of the samples taken after the removal, the total bacterial count was below 10(2), and in 95.2% lactobacilli fell below 10(2).   conclusion these results indicate that the efficacy of chemomechanical removal of carious dentine in children by means of carisolv' is comparable to the results obtained by conventional methods, and thus might serve as a suitable alternative.
autism is a childhood neuro-developmental disorder, and reelin (reln) is an important candidate gene for influencing autism. this study aimed at investigating the influence of genetic variants of the reln gene on autism susceptibility. in this study, 205 autism patients and 210 healthy controls were recruited and the genetic variants of the reln gene were genotyped by the created restriction site-polymerase chain reaction (crs-pcr) method. the influence of genetic variants on autism susceptibility was analyzed by association analysis, and the g.296596g > a genetic variant in exon10 of the reln gene was detected. the frequencies of allele/genotype in autistic patients were significantly different from those in healthy controls, and a statistically significant association was detected between this genetic variant and autism susceptibility. our data lead to the inference that the g.296596g > a genetic variant in the reln gene has a potential influence on autism susceptibility in the chinese han population. autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with severe cognitive and communication disabilities, that has a strong genetic predisposition.1 reelin, a protein involved in neuronal migration during development, is encoded by a gene located on 7q22,2 within the candidate region on 7q showing increased allele sharing in previous genome scans.3–8 a case/control and family-based association study recently reported a positive association between a trinucleotide repeat polymorphism (ggc) located in the 5′ untranslated region (utr) of the reelin gene and autism.9 we performed a transmission disequilibrium test (tdt) analysis of the 5′utr polymorphism in 167 families including 218 affected subjects (117 trios and 50 affected sib pairs) and found no evidence of linkage/association. our results do not support previous findings and suggest that this ggc polymorphism of the reelin gene is unlikely to be a major susceptibility factor in autism and/or genetic heterogeneity.
we consider how to design network cost-sharing protocols to induce benign selfish behavior in large networks. we study this issue in network cost-sharing games, where the set of nash equilibria depends fundamentally on the choice of the underlying edge cost-sharing protocols. we seek cost-sharing protocols that minimize the inefficiency of equilibria in the resulting network design game, as measured by the price of anarchy or the price of stability. we delineate between oblivious cost-sharing protocols, where each edge computes cost shares using only “local” information, and the more powerful but less practical class of non-oblivious protocols, where the cost-sharing method of an edge can be informed by the global structure of the network. in undirected networks, even oblivious cost-sharing schemes can dramatically improve the worstcase price of anarchy over that incurred by previously considered schemes. we give nearly matching upper and lower bounds on the worst-case price of anarchy achievable by both oblivious and non-oblivious cost-sharing, in both single-sink and multicommodity networks. in directed networks, simple examples show that non-trivial positive results are possible only for the price of stability. we show that among oblivious cost-sharing protocols, the shapley cost-sharing scheme minimizes the worst-case price of stability. conceptually, this result implies that giving edges the ability to identify the identities of its users—as opposed to just the number of users—has no impact on the price of stability, provided only local information is available. we also give results for the price of stability under non-oblivious cost-sharing schemes. department of computer science, stanford university, 393 terman engineering building, stanford, ca 94305. research supported in part by nsf award 0323766. email: holin@stanford.edu. department of computer science, stanford university, 462 gates building, 353 serra mall, stanford, ca 94305. supported in part by onr grant n00014-04-1-0725, darpa grant w911nf-05-1-0224, and an nsf career award. email: tim@cs.stanford.edu. harvard university. part of this work done while visiting stanford university and supported in part by darpa grant w911nf05-1-0224. email: valiant@fas.harvard.edu. we investigate cost-sharing algorithms for multicast transmission. economic considerations point to two distinct mechanisms, marginal cost and shapley value, as the two solutions most appropriate in this context. we prove that the former has a natural algorithm that uses only two messages per link of the multicast tree, while we give evidence that the latter requires a quadratic total number of messages. we also show that the welfare value achieved by an optimal multicast tree is np-hard to approximate within any constant factor, even for bounded-degree networks. the lower-bound proof for the shapley value uses a novel algebraic technique for bounding from below the number of messages exchanged in a distributed computation; this technique may prove useful in other contexts as well.
aliment pharmacol ther 2010; 32: 1275–1291 irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) involves a broad range of physiological and psychological alterations that may affect brain–gut dysregulation, gut function, visceral perception, and mucosal integrity and function. despite advances in our understanding of basic neuroenteric mechanisms and the role of effectors and transmitters in the brain–gut axis, a reliable biologic marker of ibs has yet to be identified (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). ibs diagnosis and status depend entirely on an assessment of ibs signs and symptoms. this has made development of optimal end points and study design for evaluation of efficacy of ibs drugs a challenge. this article addresses three main topics: the evolution of primary end points for ibs clinical trials; a potential path forward for ibs end points in new clinical trials; and recommendations for the future development of patient-reported outcome (pro) instruments for use in ibs clinical trials.
our previous work reported a relationship between foxo1 mutations and growth of qinchuan (qc) cattle. here, we performed differential expression analysis of foxo1 and its association analysis with growth traits in qc cattle. first, we measured the expression of the foxo1 gene in nine tissues during three developmental stages. the results showed that foxo1 was abundantly expressed in tissues of calves but was strongly repressed in adulthood, although there was significant transcription in skeletal muscle. foxo1 expression showed gradual up-regulation during differentiation of primary bovine skeletal muscle cells. we also identified six snps of the bovine foxo1 gene by sequencing dna pools of samples from 488 individuals, and association analysis indicated that five snps were significantly associated with some growth traits in the qc population. we further analyzed four haplotype combinations of the six snps and found significant correlation with body length (p<0.01). in conclusion, foxo1 participates in bovine myocyte differentiation and expression, and may be a strong candidate as a gene that affects growth traits that could be exploited in a qc cattle breeding program. more generally, our data provide a new theoretical basis for qc beef breeding and beef quality improvement. forkhead box (fox) proteins play critical roles in the regulation of differentiation, proliferation, immunity and aging of cells. most studies on fox proteins are limited to cultured cells and rodent. the aim of the current study is to detect by immunohistrochemistry whether foxo1, foxo3a and foxo4 proteins are localized in the stomach and intestine of the pig. the results showed that foxo4 exists in the mucosa in all parts of the stomach and intestine; foxo3a exists mainly in the lamina propria and muscularis of some parts. however, foxo1 is not detectable in all parts of the stomach and intestine. collectively, the results of the present study indicate that there exists a distinct expression pattern of fox proteins, and that foxo4 is a primary forkhead transcriptional factor localized in the gastrointestinal tracts of the pig.
the concentrations of total mercury in muscle (17 samples), liver (16 samples) and kidney tissues (16 samples) of both bottlenose (tursiops truncatus) and striped dolphins (stenella coeruloalba) were analyzed by cold vapour atomic absorption (aa) spectroscopy. the dolphins were found dead at different locations along the east adriatic over a 10-year period starting in 1990. in this study, the magnitude of mercury contamination of dolphins which are indicators of contamination of the adriatic as well as the mediterranean sea was determined. our results represent the first investigation of heavy metal concentrations in dolphins sampled along the croatian coast of the adriatic sea. total mercury levels were high, ranging from 1.51 to 136.7 mg/kg in muscle, from 2.04 to 143.1 in kidney and from 10.35 to 1 833 mg/kg in liver tissues (expressed as wet weight). these results were examined for differences based upon age and tissue type. a high correlation was observed between total mercury concentration and age, and adult dolphins (10 samples) contained statistically significant higher concentrations of mercury compared to juvenile (seven samples) dolphins. mercury concentrations were generally the highest in liver tissue. the presence of high mercury levels in dolphins is attributed to natural as well as anthropogenic sources. tissue distributions of metals (mercury, lead, cadmium, zinc, copper, iron, manganese) were determined in six specimens of striped dolphins (stenella coeruleoalba, meyen) stranded on the apulian coasts (southern italy) between february and june 1987. methyl mercury and selenium were also determined in the liver samples. the liver accumulated the highest concentrations of metals, except for cadmium and chromium. metal levels were higher than those found in dolphins living in the atlantic, but lower than those recorded in the same species from the french mediterranean coasts. necroscopic surveys found that all specimens were affected by haemorrhagic gastritis, but the cause was not clear. while it was not possible to related the death of dolphins to a specific cause, or to contaminants, the accumulation of metals is likely to contribute to the health of the organism and represents a risk factor for dolphins.
matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, the pathology underlying the majority of coronary artery disease (cad). in this study we tested the hypothesis that polymorphic variation in the mmp genes influences the risk of developing atherosclerosis. we analyzed functional polymorphisms in the promoter of the mmp-1, mmp-3, mmp-9 and mmp-12 genes in 183 brazilian caucasian individuals submitted to coronary angiography, of which 67 (37%) had normal coronary arteries (control group) and 116 (63%) had cad (cad patient group). the -1607 1g/2g mmp-1, -1171 5a/6a mmp-3, -1562 c/t mmp-9, -82 a/g mmp-12 polymorphisms were analyzed by pcr followed by restriction digestion. no significant differences were observed in allele frequencies between the cad patients and controls. haplotype analysis showed no differences between the cad patients and controls. there was a significant difference in the severity of cad, as assessed by the number of diseased vessels, in mmp-1 1g/1g homozygous individuals and in those homozygous for the 6a allele of the mmp-3 polymorphism. however, multivariate analysis showed that diabetes mellitus was the only variable independently associated with cad severity. our findings indicated that mmp polymorphisms have no significant impact on the risk and severity of cad. matrix metalloproteinase-9 (mmp-9) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, the pathology underlying the majority of coronary artery disease. we previously identified several polymorphisms in the gene encoding mmp-9. in this study we tested the hypothesis that variation in the matrix metalloproteinase-9 gene influences the development of atherosclerosis. three common polymorphisms, i.e. −1562c>t, r+279q and +6c>t, were analysed in 1510 white subjects undergoing coronary angiography. analyses of individual polymorphisms showed that the frequencies of the c/t and t/t genotypes of the −1562c>t polymorphism were significantly higher in patients with coronary stenosis than in those with a normal angiogram. logistic regression analyses indicated that individuals carrying the −1562t allele had an approx. 1.5-fold higher risk of developing coronary stenosis (or 1.49, 95% ci 1.039–2.144), which was equivalent to an over 30% reduction in risk of coronary stenosis in individuals not carrying this allele (or 0.670, 95% ci 0.467–0.963). the three polymorphisms studied were found to be in strong linkage disequilibrium. haplotype analyses showed that the c-g-c haplotype (−1562c, +279q and +6c) was associated with a protective effect against atherosclerosis. individuals carrying this haplotype were at reduced risk of developing coronary stenosis (or 0.695, 95% ci 0.530.92). furthermore, the c-g-c haplotype was associated with less severe coronary atherosclerosis, i.e. carriers of this haplotype were at a lower risk of having coronary stenosis in more than one coronary artery (or 0.796, 95% ci 0.640.99). these data, together with the previous finding that the −1562t allele has a higher transcriptional activity than the −1562c allele, support the notion that genetic variation with an effect on mmp-9 expression influences the development and progression of atherosclerosis.
interindividual response variability to various motor-cortex stimulation protocols has been recently reported. comparative data of stimulation protocols with different modes of action is lacking. we aimed to compare the efficacy and response variability of two ltp-inducing stimulation protocols in the human motor cortex: anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tdcs) and paired-associative stimulation (pas25). in two experiments 30 subjects received 1ma a-tdcs and pas25. data analysis focused on motor-cortex excitability change and response defined as increase in mep applying different cut-offs. furthermore, the predictive pattern of baseline characteristics was explored. both protocols induced a significant increase in motor-cortical excitability. in the pas25 experiments the likelihood to develop a mep response was higher compared to a-tdcs, whereas for intracortical facilitation (icf) the likelihood for a response was higher in the a-tdcs experiments. baseline icf (12 ms) correlated positively with an increase in meps only following a-tdcs and responders had significantly higher icf baseline values. contrary to recent studies, we showed significant group-level efficacy following both stimulation protocols confirming older studies. however, we also observed a remarkable amount of nonresponders. our findings highlight the need to define sufficient physiological read-outs for a given plasticity protocol and to develop predictive markers for targeted stimulation. objective to induce prolonged motor cortical excitability reductions by transcranial direct current stimulation in the human.   methods cathodal direct current stimulation was applied transcranially to the hand area of the human primary motor cortex from 5 to 9 min in separate sessions in twelve healthy subjects. cortico-spinal excitability was tested by single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation. transcranial electrical stimulation and h-reflexes were used to learn about the origin of the excitability changes. neurone specific enolase was measured before and after the stimulation to prove the safety of the stimulation protocol.   results five and 7 min direct current stimulation resulted in motor cortical excitability reductions, which lasted for minutes after the end of stimulation, 9 min stimulation induced after-effects for up to an hour after the end of stimulation, as revealed by transcranial magnetic stimulation. muscle evoked potentials elicited by transcranial electric stimulation and h-reflexes did not change. neurone specific enolase concentrations remained stable throughout the experiments.   conclusions cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation is capable of inducing prolonged excitability reductions in the human motor cortex non-invasively. these changes are most probably localised intracortically.
after weaning, piglets are often fed diets supplemented with high concentrations of zinc (zn) to decrease post-weaning diarrhea. the aim of this study was to elucidate the regulation of zn homeostasis within intestinal epithelial cells during excessive zn exposure. high zn concentrations elevated the intracellular zn level in ipec-j2 and caco-2 cells which was influenced by differentiation status and time of exposure. with increasing zn concentrations, mrna and protein levels of metallothionein (mt) and zinc transporter 1 (znt1) were upregulated, whereas zinc transporter 4 (zip4) expression was downregulated. metal-regulatory transcription factor-1 (mtf1) mrna expression was upregulated at high zn concentrations in ipec-j2 cells, which corresponded to higher intracellular zn concentrations. based on these results, we suggest that intestinal epithelial cells adapt the expression of these genes to the amount of extracellular zn available in order to maintain zn homeostasis. cell line-dependent differences in the regulation of zn homeostasis were detected. the uptake, intracellular distribution and cytotoxicity of high doses of extracellular zinc was investigated in c6 rat glioma cells. net zinc uptake occurred only above certain thresholds in time and concentration, below them no alterations of the intracellular zinc level were observed. these results were obtained by measurements with the fluorescent dye zinquin and by atomic absorption spectrometry, yielding similar results with both methods. sequestration of zinc in intracellular vesicles was observed by fluorescence microscopy. a protective effect of vesicular sequestration is indicated, because increased levels of intracellular zinc located in vesicles did not necessarily lead to an increase in cytotoxicity. we were able to show that in c6 cells, in contrast to other cell lines, zinc that is released from proteins by the no donor snoc is also sequestered in vesicular structures. these zinc-carrying vesicles showed to be constitutive and are assumed to have a function in the maintainance of the cytosolic content of zn2+ ions.
long-lived ames dwarf mice lack growth hormone, prolactin, and thyroid stimulating hormone. additionally the dwarf mice have enzyme activities and levels that combat oxidative stress more efficiently than those of normal mice. we have shown that methionine metabolism in ames mice is markedly different than in their wild type littermates. in our previous work we hypothesized that the flux of methionine to the transsulfuration pathway is enhanced in the dwarf mice. the current study was designed to determine whether the flux of methionine to the transsulfuration pathway is increased. we did this by injecting either l-[methyl-(3)h]-methionine or l-[(35)s]-methionine into dwarf or normal mice and then determined retained label (in form of s-adenosylmethionine) 45 min later. the amount of retained hepatic (3)h and (35)s label was significantly reduced in the dwarf mice; at 45 min the specific radioactivity of sam (pci/nmol sam) was 56% lower (p < 0.05) for (3)h-label and 64% lower (p < 0.005) for (35)s-label in dwarf than wild type mice. retention of (35)s was significantly lower in the brain (37%, p < .04) and kidney (47%, p < 0.02) of the dwarf compared to wild type mice; there was no statistical difference in retained (3)h-label in either brain or kidney. this suggests that both the methyl-moiety and the carbon chain of methionine are lost much faster in the dwarf compared to the wild type mouse, implying that both transmethylation in the liver and transsulfuration in the liver, brain, and kidney are increased in the dwarf mice. as further support, we determined by real-time rt pcr the expression of methionine metabolism genes in livers of mice. compared to wild type, the ames dwarf had increased expression of methionine adenosyltransferase 1a (2.3-fold, p = 0.013), glycine n-methyltransferase (3.8-fold, p = 0.023), betaine homocysteine methyltransferase (5.5-fold, p = 0.0006), s-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (3.8-fold, p = 0.0005), and cystathionase (2.6-fold; tended to be increased, p = 0.055). methionine synthase expression was significantly decreased in dwarf compared to wild type (0.48-fold, p = 0.023). these results confirm that the flux of methionine to transsulfuration is enhanced in the ames dwarf. this, along with data from previous studies support the hypothesis that altered methionine metabolism plays a significant role in the oxidative defense of the dwarf mouse and that the mechanism for the enhanced oxidative defense may be through altered gsh metabolism as a result of the distinctive methionine metabolism. factors affecting longevity are complex and poorly understood. we have recently found that ames dwarf mice (df/df), which are deficient in growth hormone (gh), prolactin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone, live significantly longer than their normal siblings whereas transgenic mice that overexpress gh exhibit reduced life-spans and various indices of premature aging. the production of reactive oxygen species increases with aging and is associated with dna damage to the tissues. however, several cellular oxygen scavenging/detoxifying systems exist that improve the antioxidative defense capacity of cells. we evaluated the activity of enzymes involved in this defense system in liver, kidney, and heart tissue from dwarf, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase-bovine gh transgenic, and corresponding groups of normal mice. liver glutathione and ascorbate levels were lower (p<0.0025) in dwarf animals compared to normal and gh transgenic mice. by contrast, the level of catalase activity, which detoxifies hydrogen peroxide, in dwarf liver and kidney was significantly higher when compared to the other groups. animals deficient in gh (dwarf) live longer and exhibit enzyme activities and levels that may combat oxidative stress more efficiently than normal mice and those overexpressing gh.
a cross sectional study to determine the prevalence and socioeconomic importance of major metacestodes of cattle was conducted from november 2007 to april 2008 at wolaita soddo abattoir. accordingly, of 415 randomly selected slaughtered cattle, 11.3% and 15.4% were infected with cysticercus bovis and hydatid cysts, respectively. the anatomical distributions of these parasites include various organs. the major risk factors for cysticercosis prevalence were origin of the animals (p < 0.001, or = 7.3) and breeds (p = 0.004, or = 4.3), and hydatid cysts prevalence was significantly varied with different origins (p = 0.021, or = 2.8). the viability of c. bovis was higher (28.3%) than that of hydatid cyst (1.7%). of 79 interviewed respondents, 50.63% had acquired taeniasis and analysis of the risk factors showed association of religions (p = 0.003, or = 24.4), occupation (p < 0.001, or = 6.9), educational background (p = 0.035, or = 2.7) and age (p < 0.001, or = 3.9) of the respondents with taeniasis prevalence. furthermore, the inventory of taeniasis drugs dose and treatment cost were estimated to be 335,772 adult doses and 93,310 usd. in conclusion, the findings of the present study imply the zoonotic and socioeconomic importance of the diseases, which need intervention. objective the study was conducted between october 2005 and april 2006 in awassa town and its surroundings to investigate the status of t. saginata taeniasis, its socio-economic importance and potential risk factors.   methods questionnaire survey was conducted on 120 volunteer individuals selected at random. additionally, retrospective study on taenicidal drugs inventories at 12 pharmaceutical shops was conducted.   results t. saginata taeniasis was a wide spread problem in the town and its surroundings with overall prevalence of 64.2% (77 out of 120) and maximum infection frequencies of five times per year. the prevalence of taeniasis was significantly varied between religion, occupation, raw meat consumption and use of spices with raw meat. accordingly, christian communities (or = 5.2, 95% ci = 1.20-22.50), high-risk groups (or = 4.05, 95% ci = 1.27-12.93), raw meat consumers (or = 7.9, 95% ci = 2.46-5.66), and spices users (or = 11.6, 95% ci = 2.85-47.28) had higher likelihood of acquiring taeniasis than muslim communities, low risk groups, cooked meat eaters and non-spices users, respectively. conversely, prevalence was not varied between sex, age, marital status and educational backgrounds of the respondents. respondents' preferences to available taenicidal drugs had strong linear relationship with drug dose sold (r2 = 0.92), and showed that niclosamide (46.8%) was the drug of first choice while praziquantel (13%) was the least preferred drug. the taenicidal drug doses and treatment cost from 2002 to 2005 were estimated to be 4,913,346 adult doses and 820,343 usd (7,219,021 eth. birr as per rate of 2006).   conclusion taeniasis was a wide spread problem with higher prevalence and frequent infections in the town and its surroundings. sociocultural conditions and occupation were the major risk factors for the occurrence of the disease. hence, owing to its public health and economic importance, taeniasis deserves serious attention in order to safeguard the public health.
the topic of this paper is content-based image retrieval (cbir) based on colors as a content image descriptor. the tool we developed to that purpose modelizes the colors of an image as a set of 2d gaussian distributions based on weighted color histograms. then, given a reference image proposed by a user, the system can automatically classify the image and provide the user with the most similar images to the reference image in its category. experiments with corel-1000 dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the known implementations. this paper presents a novel bag of features (bof) method for image classification. the bof approach describes an image as a set of local descriptors using a histogram, where each bin represents the importance of a visual word. this indexing approach has been frequently used for image classification, and we have seen several implementations, but crucial representation choices — such as the weighting schemes — have not been thoroughly studied in the literature. in our work, we propose a fuzzy model as an alternative to known weighting schemes in order to create more representative image signatures. furthermore, we use the fuzzy signatures to train the gaussian naïve bayesian network and classify images. experiments with corel-1000 dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the known implementations.
background: obstructive sleep apnea (osa) is a common, serious, under-recognized and under-diagnosed medical disorder. polysomnography (psg) is the gold standard diagnostic test for osa; however, the cost of testing and the shortage of sleep disorders laboratories limit access to this tool. therefore, there is a need for a simple and reliable diagnostic tool to screen patients at risk of osa. objective: this study was conducted to evaluate the validity and reliability of an arabic version of the stop-bang questionnaire (sbq) as a screening tool for osa. methods: this study was conducted in three steps, as follows: step 1: the sbq was translated from english to arabic (examining both forward and backward translations); step 2: the test-retest reliability of the questionnaire was investigated; and step 3: the questionnaire was validated against psg data prospectively on 100 patients attending a sleep disorders clinic who were subjected to a full-night psg study after completing the translated version of the sbq. the validity of the test was tested against the apnea-hypopnea index (ahi). results: the study group had a mean age of 46.6 ± 14.0 years and a mean ahi of 50.0 ± 37.0/hour. the study demonstrated a high degree of internal consistency and stability over time for the translated sbq. the cronbach’s alpha coefficient for the 8-item tool was 0.7. validation of the sbq against the ahi at a cut-off of 5 revealed a sensitivity of 98% and positive and negative predictive values of 86% and 67%, respectively. conclusion: the arabic version of the sbq is an easy-to-administer, simple, reliable and valid tool for the identification of osa in the sleep disorders clinic setting. this study compared the predictive abilities of the stop-bang and epworth sleepiness scale (ess) for screening sleep clinic patients for obstructive sleep apnea (osa) and sleep-disordered breathing (sdb). forty-seven new adult patients without previous diagnoses of osa or sdb were administered the stop-bang and ess and were assigned to osa or sdb risk groups based on their scores. stop-bang responses were scored with two body mass index cut points of 35 and 30 kg/m(2) (sb35 and sb30). the tools' predictive abilities were determined by comparing patients' predicted osa and sdb risks to their polysomnographic results. the sb30 correctly identified more patients with osa and sdb than the ess alone. the ess had the highest specificity for osa and sdb.
fabry disease (fd) is an x-linked inherited disease due to alpha-galactosidase a (alpha-gal a) deficiency and characterized by lysosomal storage of globotriaosylceramide (gb3) and related neutral glycosphingolipids. storage of these substrates results in multisystem manifestations, including renal failure, cardiomyopathy, premature myocardial infarctions, stroke, chronic neuronopathic pain, gastrointestinal disturbances, and skin angiokeratoma. enzyme replacement therapy (ert) with recombinant human alpha-galactosidase a (rh-alpha-gal a) is now available for the treatment of fd and in most patients results in clinical improvement or stabilization. however, ert efficacy may vary in different tissues and its long-term effects remain to be defined. as a strategy to improve the efficacy of ert, we tested the combination of rh-alpha-gal a with the chaperone molecule 1-deoxynojirimycin (dgj) in cultured fd fibroblasts with negligible residual enzyme activity. compared to the effects of rh-alpha-gal a alone, co-administration of dgj and rh-alpha-gal a resulted in better correction (4.8 to 16.9-fold) of intracellular alpha-gal a activity, and increased amounts of the enzyme within the lysosomal compartment. the clearance of lyso-gb3, one of the substrates stored in fd and a potent inhibitor of alpha-gal a, was also significantly improved with the co-administration of dgj and rh-alpha-gal a. this study provides additional evidence for a synergistic effect between ert and pharmacological chaperone therapy and supports the idea that the efficacy of combination protocols may be superior to ert alone. in spite of the progress in the treatment of lysosomal storage diseases (lsds), in some of these disorders the available therapies show limited efficacy and a need exists to identify novel therapeutic strategies. we studied the combination of enzyme replacement and enzyme enhancement by pharmacological chaperones in pompe disease (pd), a metabolic myopathy caused by the deficiency of the lysosomal acid α-glucosidase. we showed that coincubation of pompe fibroblasts with recombinant human α-glucosidase and the chaperone n-butyldeoxynojirimycin (nb-dnj) resulted in more efficient correction of enzyme activity. the chaperone improved α-glucosidase delivery to lysosomes, enhanced enzyme maturation, and increased enzyme stability. improved enzyme correction was also found in vivo in a mouse model of pd treated with coadministration of single infusions of recombinant human α-glucosidase and oral nb-dnj. the enhancing effect of chaperones on recombinant enzymes was also observed in fibroblasts from another lysosomal disease, fabry disease, treated with recombinant α-galactosidase a and the specific chaperone 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin (dgj). these results have important clinical implications, as they demonstrate synergy between pharmacological chaperones and enzyme replacement. a synergistic effect of these treatments may result particularly useful in patients responding poorly to therapy and in tissues in which sufficient enzyme levels are difficult to obtain.

the purpose of the current study was to examine the joint influences of experiential avoidance and social problem solving on the link between childhood emotional abuse (cea) and intimate partner violence (ipv). experiential avoidance following cea may interfere with a person’s ability to effectively problem solve in social situations, increasing risk for conflict and interpersonal violence. as part of a larger study, 232 women recruited from the community completed measures assessing childhood emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, experiential avoidance, maladaptive social problem solving, and ipv perpetration and victimization. final trimmed models indicated that cea was indirectly associated with ipv victimization and perpetration via experiential avoidance and negative problem orientation (npo) and impulsivity/carelessness style (ics) social problem solving strategies. though cea was related to an avoidance style (as) social problem solving strategy, this strategy was not significantly associated with ipv victimization or perpetration. experiential avoidance had both a direct and indirect effect, via npo and ics social problem solving, on ipv victimization and perpetration. findings suggest that cea may lead some women to avoid unwanted internal experiences, which may adversely impact their ability to effectively problem solve in social situations and increase ipv risk. the problem of domestic violence is widespread, with research indicating men and women both perpetrate a substantial amount of aggression. however, aggression perpetrated by women is a relatively understudied area compared to aggression perpetrated by men. additionally, research is needed to determine the correlates of aggression perpetration among women, as this can inform more effective treatment programs. thus, the current study sought to examine the association between trait anger and impulsivity and the perpetration of physical and psychological intimate partner violence (ipv) and general aggression among women arrested for domestic violence (n = 80). findings indicated that both trait anger and impulsivity were significantly associated with aggression perpetration and trait anger mediated the relationship between impulsivity and aggression perpetration. directions for future research and violence intervention programs are discussed.
cerebral ischemia leads to neuroinflammation and activation of microglia which further contribute to stroke pathology. understanding regulation of microglial activation will aid in the development of therapeutic strategies that mitigate microglia-mediated neurotoxicity in neuropathologies, including ischemia. in this study, we investigated the epigenetic regulation of microglial activation by studying histone modification histone 3-lysine 9-acetylation (h3k9ac) and its regulation by histone deacetylase (hdac) inhibitors. in vitro analysis of activated microglia showed that hdac inhibitor, sodium butyrate (sb), alters h3k9ac enrichment and transcription at the promoters of pro-inflammatory (tnf-α, nos2, stat1, il6) and anti-inflammatory (il10) genes while inducing the expression of genes downstream of the il10/stat3 anti-inflammatory pathway. in an experimental mouse (c57bl/6ntac) model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (mcao), we observed that sb mediates neuroprotection by epigenetically regulating the microglial inflammatory response, via downregulating the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, tnf-α and nos2, and upregulating the expression of anti-inflammatory mediator il10, in activated microglia. interestingly, h3k9ac levels were found to be upregulated in activated microglia distributed in the cortex, striatum, and hippocampus of mcao mice. a similar upregulation of h3k9ac was detected in lipopolysaccharide (lps)-activated microglia in the wistar rat brain, indicating that h3k9ac upregulation is consistently associated with microglial activation in vivo. altogether, these results show evidence of hdac inhibition being a promising molecular switch to epigenetically modify microglial behavior from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory which could mitigate microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. in the healthy adult brain, neurogenesis normally occurs in the subventricular zone (svz) and hippocampal dentate gyrus (dg). cerebral ischemia enhances neurogenesis in neurogenic and non‐neurogenic regions of the ischemic brain of adult rodents. this study demonstrated that post‐insult treatment with a histone deacetylase inhibitor, sodium butyrate (sb), stimulated the incorporation of bromo‐2′‐deoxyuridine (brdu) in the svz, dg, striatum, and frontal cortex in the ischemic brain of rats subjected to permanent cerebral ischemia. sb treatment also increased the number of cells expressing polysialic acid–neural cell adhesion molecule, nestin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, phospho‐camp response element‐binding protein (creb), and brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) in various brain regions after cerebral ischemia. furthermore, extensive co‐localization of brdu and polysialic acid–neural cell adhesion molecule was observed in multiple regions after ischemia, and sb treatment up‐regulated protein levels of bdnf, phospho‐creb, and glial fibrillary acidic protein. intraventricular injection of k252a, a tyrosine kinase b receptor antagonist, markedly reduced sb‐induced cell proliferation detected by brdu and ki67 in the ipsilateral svz, dg, and other brain regions, blocked sb‐induced nestin expression and creb activation, and attenuated the long‐lasting behavioral benefits of sb. together, these results suggest that histone deacetylase inhibitor‐induced cell proliferation, migration and differentiation require bdnf–tyrosine kinase b signaling and may contribute to long‐term beneficial effects of sb after ischemic injury.
audio-visual stimuli typically yield faster responses than isolated modality-specific ones. this crossmodal speed advantage depends upon efficient multisensory integration mechanisms in the brain. here, we used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rtms) to address the role of the posterior parietal cortex, in particular of the inferior parietal lobule (ipl), in speeding up responses to crossmodal stimuli. the results show that rtms over ipl impairs the response to contralateral modality-specific visual and auditory targets without affecting the response speed advantage following audio-visual targets. furthermore, this speed advantage is subserved by a neural coactivation mechanism suggesting a summation in a given neural site. control rtms over v1 impaired only contralateral visual responses without affecting the response to auditory or audio-visual targets. these results suggest that the response speed advantage for crossmodal targets is maintained in spite of the ipl interference that impairs modality-specific responses. the possible role of alternative sites for the audio-visual advantage, such as the superior colliculus, is discussed. although the importance of the posterior parietal and prefrontal regions in spatial localization of visual stimuli is well established, their role in auditory space perception is less clear. using positron emission tomography (pet) during auditory and visual spatial localization in the same subjects, modality-specific areas were identified in the superior parietal lobule, middle temporal and lateral prefrontal cortices. these findings suggest that, similar to the visual system, the hierarchical organization of the auditory system extends beyond the temporal lobe to include areas in the posterior parietal and prefrontal regions specialized in auditory spatial processing. our results may explain the dissociation of visual and auditory spatial localization deficits following lesions involving these regions.
purpose to introduce a novel approach for the time-dependent quantification of risk factors for prostate cancer (pca) detection after an initial negative biopsy.   patients and methods data for 1,871 men with initial negative biopsies and at least one follow-up biopsy were available. piecewise exponential regression models were developed to quantify hazard ratios (hrs) and define cumulative incidence curves for pca detection for subgroups with specific patterns of risk factors over time. factors evaluated included age, race, serum prostate-specific antigen (psa) concentration, psa slope, digital rectal examination, dysplastic glands or prostatitis on biopsy, ultrasound gland volume, urinary symptoms, and number of negative biopsies.   results four hundred sixty-five men had pca detected, after a mean follow-up time of 2.8 years. all of the factors were independent predictors of pca detection except for psa slope, as a result of its correlation with time-dependent psa level, and race. psa (hr = 3.90 for > 10 v 2.5 to 3.9 ng/ml), high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia/atypical glands (hr = 2.97), gland volume (hr = 0.39 for > 50 v < 25 ml), and number of repeat biopsies (hr = 0.36 for two v zero repeat biopsies) were the strongest predictors. men with high-risk versus low-risk event histories had a 20-fold difference in pca detection over 5 years.   conclusion piecewise exponential models provide an approach to longitudinal analysis of pca risk that allows clinicians to see the interplay of risk factors as they unfold over time for individual patients. with these models, it is possible to identify distinct subpopulations with dramatically different needs for monitoring and repeat biopsy. objectives to assess the current incidence of prostate carcinoma detection in serial biopsies in a prostate-specific antigen-based screening population after a diagnosis of isolated high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (hg-pin) in needle biopsy tissue.   methods we retrospectively identified 190 men with a diagnosis of isolated hg-pin in needle biopsy tissue. most men (86%) were diagnosed from 1996 to 2000. logistic regression analysis was used to predict the presence of carcinoma in these 190 men and in a control group of 1677 men with only benign prostatic tissue in needle biopsy tissue.   results the cumulative risk of detection of carcinoma on serial sextant follow-up biopsies was 30.5% for those with isolated hg-pin compared with 26.2% for the control group (p = 0.2). patient age (p = 0.03) and serum prostate-specific antigen level (p = 0.02) were significantly linked to the risk of cancer detection, but suspicious digital rectal examination findings (p = 0.1), the presence of hg-pin (p = 0.2), and the histologic attributes of pin were not (all with nonsignificant p values). hg-pin found on the first repeat biopsy was associated with a 41% risk of subsequent detection of carcinoma compared with an 18% risk if benign prostatic tissue was found on the first repeat biopsy (p = 0.01).   conclusions the results of our study have shown that the current level of risk for the detection of prostate carcinoma in a screened population is 30.5% after a diagnosis of isolated hg-pin in a needle biopsy. this risk level is lower than the previously reported risk of 33% to 50%. hg-pin is a risk factor for carcinoma detection only when found on consecutive sextant biopsies. the data presented here should prompt reconsideration of repeat biopsy strategies for hg-pin, and re-evaluation of the absolute necessity of repeat biopsy for all patients with hg-pin.
animal tracking through argos satellite telemetry has enormous potential to test hypotheses in animal behavior, evolutionary ecology, or conservation biology. yet the applicability of this technique cannot be fully assessed because no clear picture exists as to the conditions influencing the accuracy of argos locations. latitude, type of environment, and transmitter movement are among the main candidate factors affecting accuracy. a posteriori data filtering can remove “bad” locations, but again testing is still needed to refine filters. first, we evaluate experimentally the accuracy of argos locations in a polar terrestrial environment (nunavut, canada), with both static and mobile transmitters transported by humans and coupled to gps transmitters. we report static errors among the lowest published. however, the 68th error percentiles of mobile transmitters were 1.7 to 3.8 times greater than those of static transmitters. second, we test how different filtering methods influence the quality of argos location datasets. accuracy of location datasets was best improved when filtering in locations of the best classes (lc3 and 2), while the douglas argos filter and a homemade speed filter yielded similar performance while retaining more locations. all filters effectively reduced the 68th error percentiles. finally, we assess how location error impacted, at six spatial scales, two common estimators of home-range size (a proxy of animal space use behavior synthetizing movements), the minimum convex polygon and the fixed kernel estimator. location error led to a sometimes dramatic overestimation of home-range size, especially at very local scales. we conclude that argos telemetry is appropriate to study medium-size terrestrial animals in polar environments, but recommend that location errors are always measured and evaluated against research hypotheses, and that data are always filtered before analysis. how movement speed of transmitters affects location error needs additional research. study of animal movements is key for understanding their ecology and facilitating their conservation. the argos satellite system is a valuable tool for tracking species which move long distances, inhabit remote areas, and are otherwise difficult to track with traditional vhf telemetry and are not suitable for gps systems. previous research has raised doubts about the magnitude of position errors quoted by the satellite service provider cls. in addition, no peer-reviewed publications have evaluated the usefulness of the cls supplied error ellipses nor the accuracy of the new kalman filtering (kf) processing method. using transmitters hung from towers and trees in southeastern peru, we show the argos error ellipses generally contain <25% of the true locations and therefore do not adequately describe the true location errors. we also find that kf processing does not significantly increase location accuracy. the errors for both ls and kf processing methods were found to be lognormally distributed, which has important repercussions for error calculation, statistical analysis, and data interpretation. in brief, “good” positions (location codes 3, 2, 1, a) are accurate to about 2 km, while 0 and b locations are accurate to about 5–10 km. however, due to the lognormal distribution of the errors, larger outliers are to be expected in all location codes and need to be accounted for in the user’s data processing. we evaluate five different empirical error estimates and find that 68% lognormal error ellipses provided the most useful error estimates. longitude errors are larger than latitude errors by a factor of 2 to 3, supporting the use of elliptical error ellipses. numerous studies over the past 15 years have also found fault with the cls-claimed error estimates yet cls has failed to correct their misleading information. we hope this will be reversed in the near future.
the activity of cytoskeletal proteins like talin, vinculin and nestin increases in muscle that regenerates. little is known about their role or at least their expression in the process of regeneration in masticatory muscles of mdx mice, a model of duchenne muscular dystrophy. to determine a potential role of cytoskeletal proteins in the regeneration process of mdx masticatory muscles, we examined the expression of talin 1, talin 2, vinculin and nestin in 100-day-old control and mdx mice using quantitative rt-pcr, western blot analyses and histochemistry. the protein expression of talin 1, talin 2, nestin and vinculin in mdx muscles remained unchanged as compared with normal mice. however, in mdx masseter it was found a relative increase of nestin compared to controls. the protein expression of talin 1 and vinculin tended to be increased in mdx tongue and talin 2 to diminish in mdx masseter and temporal muscle. in mdx mice, we found significantly lower percentage of transcripts coding for nestin, talin 1, talin 2 and vinculin in masseter (p < 0.05) and temporal muscle (p < 0.001). in contrast, the mrna expression of nestin was found to be increased in mdx tongue. activated satellite cells, myoblasts and immature regenerated muscle fibres in mdx masseter and temporal revealed positive staining for nestin. the findings of the presented work suggest dystrophin-lack-associated changes in the expression of cytoskeletal proteins in mdx masticatory muscles could be compensatory for dystrophin absence. the expression of nestin may serve as an indicator for the regeneration in the orofacial muscles. we describe the expression and distribution patterns of nestin, desmin and vimentin in intact and regenerating muscle spindles of the rat hind limb skeletal muscles. regeneration was induced by intramuscular isotransplantation of extensor digitorum longus (edl) or soleus muscles from 15-day-old rats into the edl muscle of adult female inbred lewis rats. the host muscles with grafts were excised after 7-, 16-, 21- and 29-day survival and immunohistochemically stained. nestin expression in intact spindles in host muscles was restricted to schwann cells of sensory and motor nerves. in transplanted muscles, however, nestin expression was also found in regenerating “spindle fibers”, 7 and 16 days after grafting. from the 21st day onwards, the regenerated spindle fibers were devoid of nestin immunoreactivity. desmin was detected in spindle fibers at all developmental stages in regenerating as well as in intact spindles. vimentin was expressed in cells of the outer and inner capsules of all muscle spindles and in newly formed myoblasts and myotubes of regenerating spindles 7 days after grafting. our results show that the expression pattern of these intermediate filaments in regenerating spindle fibers corresponds to that found in regenerating extrafusal fibers, which supports our earlier suggestion that they resemble small-diameter extrafusal fibers.
purpose to determine the retinal nerve fiber layer (rnfl) thickness profile in the peripapillary region of healthy eyes.   methods three-dimensional, fourier/spectral domain optical coherence tomography (oct) data were obtained as raster scan data (512 x 180 axial scans in a 6 x 6-mm region centered on the optic nerve head [onh]) with high-speed, ultrahigh-resolution oct (hsuhr-oct) from 12 healthy subjects. rnfl thickness was measured on this three-dimensional data set with an in-house software program. the disc margin was defined subjectively in each image and rnfl thickness profiles relative to distance from the disc center were computed for quadrants and clock hours. a mixed-effects model was used to characterize the slope of the profiles.   results thickness profiles in the superior, inferior, and temporal quadrants showed an initial increase in rnfl thickness, an area of peak thickness, and a linear decrease as radial distance from the disc center increased. the nasal quadrant showed a constant linear decay without the initial rnfl thickening. a mixed-effects model showed that the slopes of the inferior, superior, and nasal quadrants differed significantly from the temporal slope (p = 0.0012, p = 0.0003, and p = 0.0004, respectively).   conclusions rnfl thickness is generally inversely related to the distance from the onh center in the peripapillary region of healthy subjects, as determined by hsuhr-oct. however, several areas showed an initial increase in rnfl, followed by a peak and a gradual decrease. aimsto establish four normal retinal nerve fibre layer (rnfl) thickness radial profiles based on third-generation optical coherence tomography (oct) and to compare them with previously reported histologic measurements.methodsa total of 20 normal eyes were studied. a circular scan was adjusted to the size of the optic disc and three scans were performed with this radius and every 200 μm thereafter, up to a distance of 1400 μm. four different radial sections (superotemporal, superonasal, inferonasal, and inferotemporal) were studied to establish rnfl thickness oct profiles. additionally, two radial scans orientated at 45 and 135° crossing the optic disc centre were performed in six of 20 eyes, and rnfl thickness was measured at disc margin.resultsquadrant location and distance from disc margin interaction in rnfl thickness was statistically significant (p<0.001). the rnfl thickness decreased (p<0.001) as the distance from the disc margin increased for all sections. the measurements automatically generated by the oct built-in software were thinner (p<0.001) than histologic ones close to the disc margin.conclusionsfour normal oct rnfl profiles were established and compared with histological data obtained from the same area. rnfl measurements assessed by oct 3 were significantly thinner close to the optic disc margin.
ll-diaminopimelate aminotransferase (ll-dap-at), a pyridoxal phosphate (plp)-dependent enzyme in the lysine biosynthetic pathways of plants and chlamydia, is a potential target for the development of herbicides or antibiotics. this homodimeric enzyme converts l-tetrahydrodipicolinic acid (thdp) directly to ll-dap using l-glutamate as the source of the amino group. earlier, we described the 3d structures of native and malate-bound ll-dap-at from arabidopsis thaliana (atdap-at). seven additional crystal structures of atdap-at and its variants are reported here as part of an investigation into the mechanism of substrate recognition and catalysis. two structures are of atdap-at with reduced external aldimine analogues: n-(5'-phosphopyridoxyl)-l-glutamate (plp-glu) and n-(5'-phosphopyridoxyl)- ll-diaminopimelate (plp-dap) bound in the active site. surprisingly, they reveal that both l-glutamate and ll-dap are recognized in a very similar fashion by the same sets of amino acid residues; both molecules adopt twisted v-shaped conformations. with both substrates, the alpha-carboxylates are bound in a salt bridge with arg404, whereas the distal carboxylates are recognized via hydrogen bonds to the well-conserved side chains of tyr37, tyr125 and lys129. the distal c(epsilon) amino group of ll-dap is specifically recognized by several non-covalent interactions with residues from the other subunit (asn309*, tyr94*, gly95*, and glu97* (amino acid designators followed by an asterisk (*) indicate that the residues originate in the other subunit of the dimer)) and by three bound water molecules. two catalytically inactive variants of atdap-at were created via site-directed mutagenesis of the active site lysine (k270n and k270q). the structures of these variants permitted the observation of the unreduced external aldimines of plp with l-glutamate and with ll-dap in the active site, and revealed differences in the torsion angle about the plp-substrate bond. lastly, an apo-atdap-at structure missing plp revealed details of conformational changes induced by plp binding and substrate entry into the active site. three-dimensional structures are reported for a mutant (betak87t) tryptophan synthase alpha2beta2 complex with either the substrate l-serine (betak87t-ser) or product l-tryptophan (betak87t-trp) at the active site of the beta-subunit, in which both amino acids form external aldimines with the coenzyme, pyridoxal phosphate. we also present structures with l-serine bound to the beta site and either alpha-glycerol 3-phosphate (betak87t-ser-gp) or indole-3-propanol phosphate (betak87t-ser-ipp) bound to the active site of the alpha-subunit. the results further identify the substrate and product binding sites in each subunit and provide insight into conformational changes that occur upon formation of these complexes. the two structures having ligands at the active sites of both alpha- and beta-subunits reveal an important new feature, the ordering of alpha-subunit loop 6 (residues 179-187). closure of loop 6 isolates the active site of the alpha-subunit from solvent and results in interaction between alphathr183 and the catalytic residue alphaasp60. other conformational differences between the wild type and these two mutant structures include a rigid-body rotation of the alpha-subunit of approximately 5 degrees relative to the beta-subunit and large movements of part of the beta-subunit (residues 93-189) toward the rest of the beta-subunit. much smaller differences are observed in the betak87t-ser structure. remarkably, binding of tryptophan to the beta active site results in conformational changes very similar to those observed in the betak87t-ser-gp and betak87t-ser-ipp structures, with exception of the disordered alpha-subunit loop 6. these large-scale changes, the closure of loop 6, and the movements of a small number of side chains in the alpha-beta interaction site provide a structural base for interpreting the allosteric properties of tryptophan synthase.
ovariectomized (ovx) female rats were trained to traverse a straight alley and return to a goal box where they had previously encountered a male rat, a female rat or an empty goal box. the time required to run the alley was used as an index of the subjects' motivation to re-engage the goal box target. subjects were tested in both estrus and non-estrus, first sexually naïve and then again after sexual experience. female rats ran most quickly for a male target, most slowly for an empty goal box, and at intermediate speeds for a female target. sexual experience tended to slow run times for all but male targets. estrus enhanced approach behavior for males and an empty goal box, but tended to slow the approach toward females, both before and after sexual experience. this latter finding was further investigated in a second experiment in which sexually naïve ovx females were tested during estrus and non-estrus in a locomotor activity apparatus, a runway with an empty goal box, and an open field. estrus produced no changes in spontaneous locomotion either in the activity box or the open field, but decreased run times in the alley and increased the number of center-square entries in the open-field. thus, estrus produces increases in sexual motivation that selectively enhance exploratory, presumably male-seeking behavior, but not simple spontaneous locomotion. choice of a male or female social contact was studied in intact female rats in a runway-choice apparatus during estrous cycle, pregnancy, and lactation. the male was chosen significantly more often during proestrus/estrus than during the diestrous days of the cycle. during pregnancy this preference in choice declined only to reappear gradually during the lactation period. the shifts in the level of motivation to seek out the male support previous studies and point to the significance of estrogen in producing the preference for the male.
epidemiological studies suggest a direct link between melanoma and parkinson's disease (pd); however, the underlying molecular basis is unknown. since mutations in parkin are the major driver of early-onset pd and parkin was recently reported to play a role in cancer development, we hypothesized that parkin links melanoma and pd. by analyzing whole exome/genome sequencing of parkin from 246 melanoma patients, we identified five non-synonymous mutations, three synonymous mutations, and one splice region variant in parkin in 3.6% of the samples. in vitro analysis showed that wild-type parkin plays a tumor suppressive role in melanoma development resulting in cell-cycle arrest, reduction of metabolic activity, and apoptosis. using a mass spectrometry-based analysis, we identified potential parkin substrates in melanoma and generated a functional protein association network. the activity of mutated parkin was assessed by protein structure modeling and examination of parkin e3 ligase activity. the parkin-e28k mutation impairs parkin ubiquitination activity and abolishes its tumor suppressive effect. taken together, our analysis of genomic sequence and in vitro data indicate that parkin is a potential link between melanoma and parkinson's disease. our findings suggest new approaches for early diagnosis and treatment against both diseases. the parkin was first identified as a gene implicated in autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism. deregulation of the parkin gene, however, has been observed in various human cancers, suggesting that the parkin gene may be important in tumorigenesis. to gain insight into the physiologic role of parkin, we generated parkin−/− mice lacking exon 3 of the parkin gene. we demonstrated here that parkin−/− mice had enhanced hepatocyte proliferation and developed macroscopic hepatic tumors with the characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma. microarray analyses revealed that parkin deficiency caused the alteration of gene expression profiles in the liver. among them, endogenous follistatin is commonly upregulated in both nontumorous and tumorous liver tissues of parkin-deficient mice. parkin deficiency resulted in suppression of caspase activation and rendered hepatocytes resistant to apoptosis in a follistatin-dependent manner. these results suggested that parkin deficiency caused enhanced hepatocyte proliferation and resistance to apoptosis, resulting in hepatic tumor development, partially through the upregulation of endogenous follistatin. the finding that parkin-deficient mice are susceptible to hepatocarcinogenesis provided the first evidence showing that parkin is indeed a tumor suppressor gene.
introduction. who recognizes low back pain as one of the most important ergonomic stressors. therefore, the present study was designed to find out the magnitude of the problem among jute mill workers in india and identify possible associations. methodology. this cross-sectional workplace based study was conducted among eight (8) selected jute mills of india. subjects with self-reported back pain for at least last 12 weeks were included and n = 717 male jute mill workers actively engaged in work entered the study and completed all assessments. results. among all participants 55% (n = 392) had current chronic low back pain. age was an important association with subjects in the age group of 40–59 years more likely to have pain (p = 0.02, or 1.44). regarding ergonomic risk factors lifting of load of more than 20 kg (p = 0.04, or 1.42) and repetitive movements of limbs (p = 0.03, or 0.67) were significant associations of chronic low back pain. conclusion. this study identified a significant prevalence of current chronic low back pain among jute mill workers. regarding ergonomic risk factors the present study has identified two significant associations: lifting of load above 20 kg and repetitive movements of limbs. therefore, this study has identified need for workplace interventions in this occupational group employing approximately 3,50,000 workers in india. a cross-sectional study of 150 adult bengalee hindu male jute mill workers of belur, a suburb of kolkata, west bengal, india, was undertaken to study the relationship of age, body mass index (bmi) and waist circumference (wc) with systolic (sbp), diastolic (dbp) and mean arterial (map) blood pressure. the mean age and the bmi of the subjects were 40.7 years (s.d. = 15.2) and 23.2 kg/m2 (s.d. = 3.2), respectively. the mean sbp, dbp and map were 124.7 mmhg (s.d. = 7.8), 81.5 mmhg (s.d. = 5.7) and 95.9 mmhg (s.d. = 6.1), respectively. age had similar significant (p < 0.001) correlations with bmi and wc. age and wc were significantly correlated (p < 0.001) with all the three blood pressure variables. in general, the correlations of bmi with sbp (r = 0.24, p < 0.01), dbp (r = 0.15, n.s.) and map (r = 0.19, p < 0.05) were weaker. age controlled multiple regression analyses demonstrated that bmi did not have a significant effect of any blood pressure variable. however, wc had a significant impact (p < 0.0001) on sbp (t = 7.068), dbp (t = 5.190) and map (t = 6.387), even after adjusting for the effect of age. moreover, even after age adjustment, percent variations in sbp (20.7%), dbp (12.5%) and map (17.2%) explained by wc were high. this significant impact (p < 0.0001) of wc on sbp (t = 9.426), dbp (t = 8.349) and map (t = 9.642) remained even after controlling for the combined effects of age and bmi.
the aim of the present study was to investigate exogenous crossmodal orienting of attention in three-dimensional (3-d) space. most studies in which the orienting of attention has been examined in 3-d space concerned either exogenous intramodal or endogenous crossmodal attention. evidence for exogenous crossmodal orienting of attention in depth is lacking. endogenous and exogenous attention are behaviorally different, suggesting that they are two different mechanisms. we used the orthogonal spatial-cueing paradigm and presented auditory exogenous cues at one of four possible locations in near or far space before the onset of a visual target. cues could be presented at the same (valid) or at a different (invalid) depth from the target (radial validity), and on the same (valid) or on a different (invalid) side (horizontal validity), whereas we blocked the depth at which visual targets were presented. next to an overall validity effect (valid rts < invalid rts) in horizontal space, we observed an interaction between the horizontal and radial validity of the cue: the horizontal validity effect was present only when the cue and the target were presented at the same depth. no horizontal validity effect was observed when the cue and the target were presented at different depths. these results suggest that exogenous crossmodal attention is “depth-aware,” and they are discussed in the context of the supramodal hypothesis of attention. two experiments were conducted to explore whether attentional selection occurs in depth, or whether attentional focus is “depth blind,” as suggested by ghiradelli and folk (1996). in experiment 1, observers viewed stereoscopic displays in which one of four spatial locations was cued. two of the locations were at a near-depth location and two were at a far-depth location, and a single target was presented along with three distractors. the results indicated a larger cost in reaction time for switching attention inx,y and depth than inx,y alone, supporting a “depth-aware” attentional spotlight. in experiment 2, no distractors were present, similar to the displays used by ghiradelli and folk. in this experiment, no effect for switching attention in depth was found, indicating that the selectivity of attention in depth depends on the perceptual load imposed on observers by the tasks and displays.
astragalus membranaceus, dried root extract, also known as astragali radix, is used in traditional chinese medicine as a tonic remedy. moreover, it has been reported that astragalus membranaceus could attenuate intestinal inflammation; however, the underlying mechanism for its anti-inflammatory activity in intestinal epithelial cells (iecs) remains unclear. in this study, we evaluated astragalus membranaceus extract (5–100 µg/ml) in a model of inflammation and oxidative stress for iecs. we showed that astragalus membranaceus extract reduced the inflammatory response induced by lipopolysaccharide from e. coli (lps) plus interferon-γ (ifn), decreasing tumor necrosis factor-α (tnf-α) release, cycloxygenase-2 (cox-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) expression, nitrotyrosine formation, nuclear factor-κb (nf-κb) activation, and reactive oxygen species (ros) release in the non-tumorigenic intestinal epithelial cell line (iec-6). the antioxidant potential of astragalus membranaceus extract was also evaluated in a model of hydrogen peroxide (h2o2)-induced oxidative stress in iec-6, indicating that this extract reduced ros release and increased nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (nrf2) activation and the expression of antioxidant cytoprotective factors in these cells. the results contributed to clarify the mechanisms involved in astragalus membranaceus extract-reduced inflammation and highlighted the potential use of this extract as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant remedy for intestinal diseases. astragalus membranaceus, also known as huang qi, a traditional chinese medicine, is often used in formulas for deficiency of vital energy characterized by limb weakness, pale face, and dizziness. previous studies have shown that astragalus membranaceus could attenuate intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury induced by hemorrhagic shock in rats; however, the underlying mechanism still remains unclear. using a hemorrhagic shock rat model to examine the effect of astragalus membranaceus on intestinal mucosa injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion, we found that treatment (20 g crude drugs/kg, i.v.) produced antioxidative effects in the intestinal mucosa of rats after ischemia-reperfusion (p < 0.05). we also found that astragalus membranaceus could partly attenuate intestinal mucosa ischemia-reperfusion injury (chiu's score, apoptosis index p < 0.05). these results suggest that astragalus membranaceus reduces intestinal mucosa injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion in rats, at least in part, through its anti-oxidative effects.
the aim of this work was to investigate the hypothesis that multimodal mri is able to detect the progressive disruption of volume and microstructure of subcortical structures in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (a-mci) and mild alzheimer's disease (ad) in comparison with healthy controls (ctrl). we combined volumetric and diffusion tensor imaging (dti) techniques in a cross-sectional study including 30 a-mci, 30 ad patients, and 30 age-matched ctrl. we employed a fully automated model-based segmentation algorithm on 3 tesla mri anatomical images and accurate coregistration of dti to anatomical images to extract regional values of dti parameters. both the hippocampi significantly and progressively decreased in volume from ctrl through mci to ad. both the thalami showed a progressive and significant decrease in volume from ctrl to ad. mean diffusivity (md) values increased progressively across the three groups in the bilateral hippocampus, amygdala, and in the right caudate. no differences in fractional anisotropy (fa) values were found. two distinct but overlapping patterns of progression of structural (i.e., atrophy) and microstructural (i.e., md increase) damage were observed. particularly, the pattern of atrophy was mirrored by the increasing value of the averaged md, which provided a further indicator of subtle tissue disruption in the hippocampal structure in mild ad patients. combining different mri modalities can allow identifying sensitive indicators of the subtle pathogenic mechanisms that occur in subcortical areas of ad patients. purpose to compare the regional diffusivity of water in the brains of normally aging elderly people and patients with mild cognitive impairment (mci) or alzheimer disease.   materials and methods magnetic resonance images were obtained in 21 patients with alzheimer disease, 19 patients with mci, and 55 normally aging elderly control subjects without evidence of cognitive impairment. regions of interest were drawn to compare the apparent diffusion coefficient (adc) and the anisotropy index (ai) in frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital, anterior, and posterior cingulate white matter (wm), and the thalami and hippocampi.   results hippocampal adc was higher in mci and alzheimer disease patients than in control subjects. adc of the temporal stem and posterior cingulate, occipital, and parietal wm was higher in alzheimer disease patients than in control subjects. except for occipital ai, which was lower in mci patients than in control subjects, there were no differences in ai among the three groups for any of the regions.   conclusion hippocampal adc was significantly different between control subjects and mci patients, many of whom likely have preclinical alzheimer disease. elevation in hippocampal adc may reflect early ultrastructural changes in the progression of alzheimer disease.
backgroundemissions from a large peat fire in north carolina in 2008 were associated with increased hospital admissions for asthma and the rate of heart failure in the exposed population. peat fires often produce larger amounts of smoke and last longer than forest fires, however few studies have reported on their toxicity. moreover, reliable alternatives to traditional animal toxicity testing are needed to reduce the number of animals required for hazard identification and risk assessments.methodssize-fractionated particulate matter (pm; ultrafine, fine, and coarse) were obtained from the peat fire while smoldering (encf-1) or when nearly extinguished (encf-4). extracted samples were analyzed for chemical constituents and endotoxin content. female cd-1 mice were exposed via oropharyngeal aspiration to 100 μg/mouse, and assessed for relative changes in lung and systemic markers of injury and inflammation. at 24 h post-exposure, hearts were removed for ex vivo functional assessments and ischemic challenge. lastly, 8 mm diameter lung slices from cd-1 mice were exposed (11 μg) ± co-treatment of pm with polymyxin b (pmb), an endotoxin-binding compound.resultson an equi-mass basis, coarse encf-1 pm had the highest endotoxin content and elicited the greatest pro-inflammatory responses in the mice including: increases in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein, cytokines (il-6, tnf-α, and mip-2), neutrophils and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ros) production. exposure to fine or ultrafine particles from either period failed to elicit significant lung or systemic effects. in contrast, mice exposed to encf-1 ultrafine pm developed significantly decreased cardiac function and greater post-ischemia-associated myocardial infarction. finally, similar exposures to mouse lung slices induced comparable patterns of cytokine production; and these responses were significantly attenuated by pmb.conclusionsthe findings suggest that exposure to coarse pm collected during a peat fire causes greater lung inflammation in association with endotoxin and ros, whereas the ultrafine pm preferentially affected cardiac responses. in addition, lung tissue slices were shown to be a predictive, alternative assay to assess pro-inflammatory effects of pm of differing size and composition. importantly, these toxicological findings were consistent with the cardiopulmonary health effects noted in epidemiologic reports from exposed populations. an intensive field study was conducted in sumatra, indonesia, during a peat fire episode to investigate the physical and chemical characteristics of particulate emissions in peat smoke and to provide necessary data for source-receptor analyses. ambient air sampling was carried out at three different sites located at varying distances from the peatfires to determine changes in mass and number concentrations of pm2.5 and its chemical composition (carbonaceous and nitrogenous materials, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, water-soluble inorganic and organic ions, and total and water-soluble metals). the three sites represent a rural site directly affected by the local peat combustion, a semirural site, and an urban site situated downwind of the peat fires. the mass concentration of pm2.5 and the number concentration of airborne particles were as high as 1600 microg/m3 and 1.7 x 10(5) cm(-3), respectively, in the vicinity of peat fires. the major components of pm2.5 in peat smoke haze were carbonaceous particles, particularly organic carbon, no3-, and so4(2-), while the less abundant constituents included ions such as nh4+, no2-, na+, k+, organic acids, and metals such as al, fe, and ti. source apportionment by chemical mass balance receptor modeling indicates that peat smoke can travel long distances and significantly affect the air quality at locations downwind.
objective to verify the incidence of tooth loss in extended age group of adults in 4 years. materials and methods the prospective cohort study assessed adults (20–64 years old) between 2011 and 2015, from piracicaba, são paulo, brazil. the dependent variable was cumulative incidence of tooth loss, assessed by difference between missing teeth (m) of decayed, missing, and filled tooth index (dmft) in 2011 and 2015. participants were stratified into young (20–44 years old) and older (45–64 years old) adults. mann–whitney u test (p < 0.05) was used to compare the means of incidence of tooth loss between age groups. results after four years, 57.7% (n = 143) of adults were followed up and the mean incidence of tooth loss was 0.91 (sd = 1.65); among these, 51 adults (35.7%) who lost their teeth showed mean tooth loss of 2.55 (sd = 1.86). in older adults, incidence of tooth loss was higher (p = 0.008), but no difference between age groups was found when only adults with incidence of tooth loss were assessed (p = 0.844). conclusion there was higher incidence of tooth loss in older adults after four years, however, without difference between age groups when only those who lost teeth were evaluated. objective to assess the relative contribution of caries and periodontal disease to tooth loss over 24 years in a cohort deprived of regular dental care.   material & methods the study population consisted of 98 subjects from a tea estate on west java, indonesia, that had been part of a prospective longitudinal study and provided full datasets of clinical assessments between 1987, 1994 and 2002. in 2011, complete sets of dental radiographs were made which was combined with the survey forms and clinical slides from the previous assessments in order to estimate reasons for tooth loss.   results thirty-seven subjects lost no teeth, whereas 61 subjects lost 185 teeth. in this group, 45.9% lost ≤2 teeth, 32.8% lost 3 to 4 teeth and 19.7% lost ≥5 teeth. the majority of teeth were lost due to caries. in five subjects, tooth loss could be attributed solely to periodontitis, whereas in four subjects teeth were lost due to both caries and periodontits. analyses of the predictor variables age, gender, smoking, education, presence of caries and severe periodontitis showed that male gender and caries were significantly associated with tooth loss.   conclusion the majority of teeth in this population were lost due to caries.
the incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (npc) varies worldwide, with higher rates in southern asia, intermediate rates in mediterranean basin countries as well as in greenland and alaska populations, and low rates in most of the western countries. the percentage of npc types seems to vary according to the who classification. portugal is also a mediterranean basin country. the npc patterns in portuguese population is comparatively analyzed with a review of the related literature, concerning the overall incidence, male/female ratio, age of incidence, who type frequency, epstein–barr virus relationship and genetic susceptibility. the particular findings in the portuguese population can be discussed in the light of genetic background and close relationships with potential exogenous oncogenic factors. information concerning the descriptive and analytical epidemiology of npc that has been reported mainly since the first international symposium on the subject in singapore in 1964 are reviewed. npc is rare in most countries in the world, with an age-adjusted incidence rate of less than 1 per 100,000, and the incidence rate is twice as high in males as in females. chinese of southern origin have a uniquely high risk, the incidence rates per 100,000 being 10--20 in males and 5--10 in females. the greater the admixture of southern chinese blood in a given ethnic group, the more likely it is that the npc incidence rate in that group will be raised. the incidence in both sexes begins to rise after the ages of 20--24 and reaches a plateau at between 45 and 54. when the logarithm of mortality and morbidity is plotted against the logarithm of the age, the power of the age that provides the best fit to a straight line on a log-log graph is approximately two to four. these figures are lower than for other cancers. seroepidemiological case-control studies indicate that both different birthplace and abnormal response to ebv antigen significantly enhance the risk for npc; when these two factors are combined, the relative risk appears to rise further. the effect of other environmental chemicals, such as from cigarette smoking, shown to be significant in several retrospective studies, could explain in part epidemiological phenomena such as sex difference in incidence. the definitive reason for the uniquely high risk in southern chinese should be further investigated by taking into account the interactions of host factors (birthplace, hla, etc.) and environmental factors (ebv, chemical carcinogens including nitrosamines, excessive intake of salted fish, nutritional deficiencies, etc.).
it is strongly suspected that cytokine-induced gene expression in inflammation is oxidant mediated; however, the intracellular sources of signaling oxidants remain controversial. in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) proinflammatory cytokines, such as tnf-alpha, trigger gene expression of endothelial adhesion molecules including mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (madcam-1). madcam-1 plays an essential role in gut inflammation by governing the infiltration of leukocytes into the intestine. several groups suggest that endothelial-derived reduced nadp (nadph) oxidase produces signaling oxidants that control the expression of adhesion molecules (e-selectin, icam-1, vcam-1). in addition to nadph oxidase, cytochrome p-450 (cyp450) monooxygenases have also been shown to trigger cytokine responses. we found that in high endothelial venular cells (svec4-10), multiple inhibitors of cyp450 monooxygenases (skf-525a, ketoconazole, troleandomycin, itraconazole) attenuated tnf-alpha induction of madcam-1, whereas nadph oxidase inhibition (pr-39) did not. conversely, e-selectin, icam-1, and vcam-1 induction requires both nadph oxidase and cyp450-derived oxidants. we show here that madcam-1 induction may depend exclusively on cyp450-derived oxidants, suggesting that cyp450 blockers might represent a possible novel therapeutic treatment for human ibd. the present study was undertaken to investigate the hypothesis that multiple oxygen radical generating systems contribute to the tumor necrosis factor (tnf) alpha-stimulated transcriptional activation of the vascular cell adhesion molecule (vcam)-1 in endothelial cells. experimental evidence has implicated the cytochrome p450 monooxygenase and a phagocyte type nadph-oxidase as a source of oxygen radicals in these cells. we show here that endothelial cells exhibit cytochrome p450 activity by measuring the o-dealkylation of the exogenous substrate 7-ethoxyresorufin, but components of the phagocyte-type nadph oxidase could not be demonstrated in endothelial cells. in that latter respect it was surprising that the nadph oxidase inhibitor apocynin completely prevented the accumulation of vcam-1 mrna. however, we found that apocynin also acts as an inhibitor of cytochrome p450 activity in endothelial cells. therefore the inhibitory effect of apocynin on the induction of vcam-1 may no longer be used to demonstrate a role for the nadph oxidase in this process. furthermore, different cytochrome p450 inhibitors co2+, metyrapone, skf525a decreased the endothelial vcam-1 expression stimulated by tnfalpha. also under hypoxic conditions the expression of vcam-1 was reduced. on this basis we assume that the oxygen dependent step in the intracellular signalling cascade underlying the tnfalpha stimulated transcriptional activation of vcam-1 resides in the activity of a cytochrome p450 dependent monooxygenase. the finding that the phospholipase a2 inhibitor bromophenacylbromide inhibited the expression of vcam-1 may indicate that arachidonic acid serves as a substrate for the cytochrome p450 monooxygenase reaction, but further research is needed to elucidate the particular cytochrome p450 family member mediating the expression of vcam-1.
we have used a fluorescently-labeled dihydropyridine (fl-dhp) to vitally stain living fucus zygotes during the establishment of cell polarity. localization of fl-dhp is primarily at the plasma membrane and fl-dhp binding is competitively blocked by an unlabeled dihydropyridine. distribution of fl-dhp is initially symmetrical before fixation of the polar axis, but becomes asymmetrical in response to a unilateral light gradient. the distribution of fl-dhp receptors can be relocalized when the direction of the photopolarizing stimulus is changed. treatment of cells with cytochalasin b prior to axis fixation reversibly prevents localization of fl-dhp receptors. observation of fl-dhp labeling by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy indicates that the existing receptors are redistributed during polar axis formation. the asymmetric distribution of fl-dhp receptors coincides temporally and spatially with increased local intracellular calcium ion concentrations, as measured by calcium green dextran. based on the site, timing, photo-reversibility, and actin dependence of the asymmetric localization of fl-dhp receptors, we conclude that fl-dhp is a vital probe for the later stage of polar axis formation in fucus zygotes. furthermore, we propose that fl-dhp receptors correspond to ion channels that are transported to the future site of polar growth to create the changes in local calcium concentration required for polarity establishment. abstract using an ultrasensitive extracellular vibrating electrode, i have studied the membrane-generated electrical currents around the egg of the brown alga, pelvetia, between fertilization and germination. during this period, the egg chooses an elongation axis and moves wall-precursor vesicles to the prospective growth region where they are secreted. this results in visible ooplasmic segregation which appears under the light microscope as a 1- to 2-μm-thick clear band at the cortex of the growth region. a steady electrical current enters a small region of the membrane and leaves the remainder of the egg's surface as early as 30 min after fertilization. this early spatial current pattern is unstable and shifts position, often with more than one inward current region. however, current enters mainly on the side where germination will occur and is usually largest at the prospective cortical clearing region. the average measured early current density is 0.06 μa/cm2 at 50 μm from the egg's surface, implying a surface current density of between 0.2 and 1 μa/cm2 due to the extrapolation uncertainty. at germination the current increases about twofold, resulting in a total transcellular current on the order of 100 pa. unilateral growth-orienting light reversal stimulates inward current on the new dark side, and subsequent morphological polarity reversal is preceded by electrical polarity reversal. the steady current tends to increase when the external ca2+ concentration is increased or the external na+ concentration is decreased, suggesting that the current is carried in part by ca2+. this current will generate a transcellular electrical field which may be the force driving the observed ooplasmic segregation.
attempts to repair muscle damage in duchenne muscular dystrophy (dmd) by transplanting skeletal myoblasts directly into muscles are faced with the problem of the limited migration of these cells in the muscles. the delivery of myogenic stem cells to the sites of muscle lesions via the systemic circulation is a potential alternative approach to treat this disease. muscle-derived stem cells (mdscs) were obtained by a macs® multisort method. clones of mdscs, which were sca-1+/cd34−/l-selectin+, were found to adhere firmly to the endothelium of mdx dystrophic muscles after i.v. or i.m. injections. the subpopulation of sca-1+/cd34− mdscs expressing l-selectin was called homing mdscs (hmdscs). treatment of hmdscs with antibodies against l-selectin prevented adhesion to the muscle endothelium. importantly, we found that vascular endothelium from striate muscle of young mdx mice expresses mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (madcam-1), a ligand for l-selectin. our results showed for the first time that the expression of the adhesion molecule l-selectin is important for muscle homing of mdscs. this discovery will aid in the improvement of a potential therapy for muscular dystrophy based on the systemic delivery of mdscs. the protein product of the human duchenne muscular dystrophy locus (dmd) and its mouse homolog (mdmd) have been identified by using polyclonal antibodies directed against fusion proteins containing two distinct regions of the mdmd cdna. the dmd protein is shown to be approximately 400 kd and to represent approximately 0.002% of total striated muscle protein. this protein is also detected in smooth muscle (stomach). muscle tissue isolated from both dmd-affected boys and mdx mice contained no detectable dmd protein, suggesting that these genetic disorders are homologous. since mdx mice present no obvious clinical abnormalities, the identification of the mdx mouse as an animal model for dmd has important implications with regard to the etiology of the lethal dmd phenotype. we have named the protein dystrophin because of its identification via the isolation of the duchenne muscular dystrophy locus.
tobacco is one of the leading causes of preventable death in the developed world. smoking is associated with a large number of oral pathologies, such as cancer and periodontitis. dental professionals can play a key role in preventing these health problems. the objectives of this study were (1) to analyze tobacco consumption habits among a group of spanish dental students, and (2) to assess their knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes regarding procedures to help patients quit smoking. a cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out at the faculty of medicine and dentistry of santiago de compostela (galicia, spain). three validated questionnaires were distributed, and the obtained data was processed using spss. one hundred twenty out of 220 surveys were completed. of the students, 18.3% were smokers and the average number of smoked cigarettes per day was 7.5. tobacco dependence and the intention to give up the habit were low (fagerström test) and doubtful (richmond test), respectively. the majority of students (94.2%) considered it appropriate to promote tobacco use cessation (tuc) activities. a great divergence of criteria regarding tobacco-associated pathologies was found among courses. this article provides positive data about the motivation of dental students to implement tuc strategies. nevertheless, the usefulness of these interventions makes it necessary to modify the university curricula in order to improve the education on this issue to reduce the incidence of future health problems. background ireland has some of the strictest smoking regulations in the world. little is known of the attitudes of student irish dental healthcare workers towards tobacco control and tobacco use cessation. this study aimed at determining the knowledge and attitudes of these students towards the deleterious effects of tobacco in the mouth and towards tobacco use cessation in dental practice.   method a questionnaire survey was distributed to 654 students (including newly qualified) on dentistry, dental hygiene and dental nursing programmes in irish dental schools. information sought included college, course, year of study, sex, age, nationality, smoking status, knowledge of effects of tobacco in the mouth and attitudes towards tobacco use cessation in dental practice and towards the irish smoking bans.   main findings there was a 90% response rate. in all, 12% of dental students, 25% of dental hygiene students and 31% of dental nursing students were current smokers. newly qualified dental hygienists were as knowledgeable about tobacco effects in the mouth as newly qualified dentists. overall, the majority in each student category believed that all three groups could be effective tobacco counsellors and should provide tobacco use cessation counselling to patients, although less than half of evening course dental nursing students felt that dental nurses could be effective counsellors or should provide counselling. there was overwhelming support for the irish smoking ban. only a minority of dental students and dental nursing students had received instruction in tobacco use cessation counselling.   conclusions there are strong positive attitudes to tobacco use cessation counselling in dental practice among these young dental healthcare students. this is true even amongst those who have not received specific instruction in tobacco use cessation counselling.
the aim of this study was to determine the effects of restricted feeding before puberty on growth performance and mammary gland development in replacement ewe lambs. at weaning, 72 dorset ewe lambs were assigned to one of the three diets: an ad libitum control diet with medium-quality forage (mqf; diet a-mqf); a restricted diet with the same forage as a, but less feed concentrate (diet r-mqf); or a high-quality forage (hqf) diet (diet f-hqf). the quantity of concentrate offered to the group r-mqf and f-hqf ewe lambs was adjusted to obtain 70% of the control ewe lambs' growth rate. the diets were offered for 75 days after weaning to cover the allometric phase of mammary gland development. during this period, average daily gain (adg) was 223 and 229 g/day for groups r-mqf and f-hqf, respectively, compared to 305 g/day for group a-mqf (p < 0.0001). at the end of this period, 28 ewe lambs were slaughtered and their mammary gland was collected. parenchymal fresh tissue weight tended to be higher for groups r-mqf and f-hqf compared to group a-mqf (p = 0.09). stroma weight was greater (p < 0.05) for the group a-mqf ewe lambs than for those in the other treatments. total dna and total protein in parenchymal tissue tended to be greater for groups r-mqf and f-hqf (p = 0.09 and p = 0.07, respectively). dry fat-free tissue was greater for groups r-mqf and f-hqf (p < 0.05). the remaining ewe lambs were fed the same haylage and barley diet until their first lambing. during this period, compensatory growth was observed. adg was greater (p < 0.01) for groups r-mqf and f-hqf than for group a-mqf, and feed conversion was improved (p < 0.01) for groups r-mqf and f-hqf compared with the control, whereas the dry matter intake was similar for all groups. live body weight, loin eye depth and backfat depth at breeding and around lambing were similar for all groups. the results of this study suggest that restricted feeding before puberty improves mammary gland development without compromising growth performance in ewe lambs. the effects of rapid weight gain to puberty on reproduction, mammary development and milk production in ewes lambing at 13 mo of age were investigated on three trials. a total of 64 dorset and 93 suffolk ewe lambs were weaned at 42 d of age and their mean weight was 16 kg. these ewes were assigned, within breed groups, to either a finishing diet or a growing diet. onset of puberty was determined by daily checks for estrus and ewes were bred beginning at 7 mo of age. in trial 2, mammary gland development was determined in eight suffolk ewes from each diet. ewes on the finishing diet were younger at puberty than those on the growing diet (199 vs 206 d, p<0.05) but required more services per conception (1.3 vs 1.1, p<0.05). dietary conception rate and lambing rate means were similar. mean 4-h milk yield was lower (p<0.10) for ewes on the finishing diet (283 g) than for those on the growing diet (310 g). mammary gland fat pad area was higher (p<0.05) for ewes on the finishing diet compared with those fed for growth. gross and adjusted duct areas were higher in ewes on the growing diet, but differences were not significant. at puberty, negative correlation coefficients for milk yield with performance traits were as follows: daily weight gain, -0.184 (p<0.08); weight-to-height ratio -0.262 (p<0.01); body condition score, -0.189 (p<0.07); and body weight, -0.212 (p<0.05). results of this study indicate that rapid weight gain to puberty impairs mammary gland development and milk production in ewe lambs.
primary immunodeficiency disorders include a variety of diseases that render patients more susceptible to infections. to determine the percentage of different primary immunodeficiency disorders diagnosed in the children's medical center hospital affiliated to tehran university of medical sciences in iran, we retrospectively reviewed the charts of the patients being referred to our hospital for immunologic evaluation of recurrent infections during a 20 year period. among these patients, antibody deficiencies were the most frequent ones and were found in 52.6% of patients (n = 130). t-cell disorders, phagocytic disorders and complement deficiencies were found to be present in 24.69% (n = 61). 22.2% (n = 55) and 0.4% (n = 1) respectively. on the whole, common variable immunodeficiency was the most frequent disorder (n = 65), followed by ataxia telangiectasia (n = 39), x-linked agammaglobulinemia (n = 33), chronic granulomatous disease (n = 29) and selective iga deficiency (n = 20). this study reveals that antibody deficiencies are the most common type of disorders as shown in other studies. a comparative study shows some differences between our results and other registries. this article also indicates that immunodeficiency disorders should be considered in patients with recurrent infections. background advances in immunologic techniques in recent years have led to increased recognition of primary immunodeficiency disorders, with iga deficiency the most common phenotype reported by most registries. there have also been reports of increased associated incidence of autoimmunity, allergy, and other diseases.   objectives we wished to determine the percentage of different primary immunodeficiency disorders seen in a pediatric tertiary hospital and to determine the association of primary immunodeficiency disorders with other diseases that are not part of classic immunodeficiency disorders.   methods we performed a retrospective review of the patients referred to our allergy/immunology clinic for immunologic evaluation of recurrent infections during an 8-year period. we also reviewed pathology reports with postmortem diagnosis of immunodeficiencies not identified while patients were alive.   results of the 91 patients with primary immunodeficiency disorders evaluated, the majority had predominantly antibody deficiencies (67%). the most common phenotype was specific antibody deficiency with normal immunoglobulins (23.1%), defined as inability to mount an adequate response to pneumococcal polysaccharides followed by igg2 subclass deficiency (17.6%). these two phenotypes were diagnosed mostly in the last 2 years of the survey. associated diseases, found in 40% of patients, were mostly allergic conditions followed by syndromic/chromosomal disorders.   conclusion the study reveals that specific antibody deficiency with normal immunoglobulins followed by igg2 subclass deficiency was the most frequently diagnosed primary immunodeficiency disorder in our patient population. it also indicates that immunodeficiency disorders should be considered in patients with other abnormalities like allergic and syndromic/chromosomal disorders that present with recurrent infections.
we introduce deepproblog, a probabilistic logic programming language that incorporates deep learning by means of neural predicates. we show how existing inference and learning techniques can be adapted for the new language. our experiments demonstrate that deepproblog supports both symbolic and subsymbolic representations and inference, 1) program induction, 2) probabilistic (logic) programming, and 3) (deep) learning from examples. to the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to propose a framework where general-purpose neural networks and expressive probabilistic-logical modeling and reasoning are integrated in a way that exploits the full expressiveness and strengths of both worlds and can be trained end-to-end based on examples. given that in practice training data is scarce for all but a small set of problems, a core question is how to incorporate prior knowledge into a model. in this paper, we consider the case of prior procedural knowledge for neural networks, such as knowing how a program should traverse a sequence, but not what local actions should be performed at each step. to this end, we present an end-to-end differentiable interpreter for the programming language forth which enables programmers to write program sketches with slots that can be filled with behaviour trained from program input-output data. we can optimise this behaviour directly through gradient descent techniques on user-specified objectives, and also integrate the program into any larger neural computation graph. we show empirically that our interpreter is able to effectively leverage different levels of prior program structure and learn complex behaviours such as sequence sorting and addition. when connected to outputs of an lstm and trained jointly, our interpreter achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for end-to-end reasoning about quantities expressed in natural language stories.
backgroundthe expanding set of genomics tools available for inbred mouse strains has renewed interest in phenotyping larger sets of strains. the present study aims to explore phenotypic variability among six commonly-used inbred mouse strains to both the rewarding and locomotor stimulating effects of cocaine in a place conditioning task, including several strains or substrains that have not yet been characterized for some or all of these behaviors.methodsc57bl/6j (b6), balb/cj (balb), c3h/hej (c3h), dba/2j (d2), fvb/nj (fvb) and 129s1/svimj (129) mice were tested for conditioned place preference to 20 mg/kg cocaine.resultsplace preference was observed in most strains with the exception of d2 and 129. all strains showed a marked increase in locomotor activity in response to cocaine. in balb mice, however, locomotor activation was context-dependent. locomotor sensitization to repeated exposure to cocaine was most significant in 129 and d2 mice but was absent in fvb mice.conclusionsgenetic correlations suggest that no significant correlation between conditioned place preference, acute locomotor activation, and locomotor sensitization exists among these strains indicating that separate mechanisms underlie the psychomotor and rewarding effects of cocaine. a meta-analysis was conducted on the data obtained from published articles that have used the conditioned place preference (cpp) paradigm to assess the rewarding effects of morphine, heroin, amphetamine and cocaine in rats. using a histogram analysis of the data, significant dose-effect curves were evident with all of the drugs examined, except for cocaine. analysis of the data also revealed that several methodological variables moderated the effect size for cpp, at least with some of the drugs examined. in particular, the following methodological variables significantly moderated cpp effect size: strain of rat used; housing condition (single or group cages); type of apparatus (2 or 3 compartments); preconditioning test (present or absent); route of drug administration; intervening saline trials (present or absent); conditioning trial duration; and drug compartment (nonpreferred, counterbalanced or white). no significant effect size differences were evident using sex, number of drug trials, or test duration as moderator variables in the analyses. these meta-analytic results may be useful to investigators for maximizing the effect size of drug-induced cpp.
earlier imaging studies in schizophrenia have reported abnormal amygdala and prefrontal cortex activity during emotion processing. we investigated with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) during emotion processing changes in activity of the amygdala and of prefrontal cortex in patients with schizophrenia during 8 weeks of olanzapine treatment. twelve previously drug-free/naive patients with schizophrenia were treated with olanzapine for 8 weeks and underwent two fmri scans after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment during implicit and explicit emotional processing. twelve healthy subjects were also scanned twice to control for potential repetition effects. results showed a diagnosis by time interaction in left amygdala and a diagnosis by time by task interaction in right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. in particular, activity in left amygdala was greater in patients than in controls at the first scan during both explicit and implicit processing, while it was lower in patients at the second relative to the first scan. furthermore, during implicit processing, right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex activity was lower in patients than controls at the first scan, while it was greater in patients at the second relative to the first scan. these results suggest that longitudinal treatment with olanzapine may be associated with specific changes in activity of the amygdala and prefrontal cortex during emotional processing in schizophrenia. introduction patients with schizophrenia show deficits in facial affect and facial identity recognition and exhibit structural and neurophysiological abnormalities in brain regions known to mediate these processes. functional neuroimaging studies of neural responses to emotional facial expressions in schizophrenia have reported both increases and decreases in medial temporal lobe (mtl) activity in schizophrenia. some of this variability may be related to the tasks performed and the baseline conditions used. here we tested whether mtl responses to human faces in schizophrenia are abnormal when unconstrained by a cognitive task and measured relative to a low-level baseline (fixation) condition.   methods 15 patients with schizophrenia and 16 healthy control subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fmri) while passively viewing human faces displaying fearful, happy, and neutral emotional expressions.   results relative to control subjects, the patients demonstrated (1) significantly greater activation of the left hippocampus while viewing all three facial expressions and (2) increased right amygdala activation during the initial presentation of fearful and neutral facial expressions.   conclusions in schizophrenia, hippocampal and amygdala activity is elevated during the passive viewing of human faces.
scaffold proteins play a crucial role in facilitating signal transduction in eukaryotes by bringing together multiple signaling components. in this study, we performed a systematic analysis of scaffold proteins in signal transduction by integrating protein-protein interaction and kinase-substrate relationship networks. we predicted 212 scaffold proteins that are involved in 605 distinct signaling pathways. the computational prediction was validated using a protein microarray-based approach. the predicted scaffold proteins showed several interesting characteristics, as we expected from the functionality of scaffold proteins. we found that the scaffold proteins are likely to interact with each other, which is consistent with previous finding that scaffold proteins tend to form homodimers and heterodimers. interestingly, a single scaffold protein can be involved in multiple signaling pathways by interacting with other scaffold protein partners. furthermore, we propose two possible regulatory mechanisms by which the activity of scaffold proteins is coordinated with their associated pathways through phosphorylation process. budding yeast contain at least four distinct mapk (mitogen activated protein kinase) cascades that transduce a variety of intracellular signals: mating-pheromone response, pseudohyphal/invasive growth, cell wall integrity, and high osmolarity adaptation. although each mapk cascade contains a conserved set of three protein kinases, the upstream activation mechanisms for these cascades are diverse, including a trimeric g protein, monomeric small g proteins, and a prokaryotic-like two-component system. recently, it became apparent that there is extensive sharing of signaling elements among the mapk pathways; however, little undesirable cross-talk occurs between various cascades. the formation of multi-protein signaling complexes is probably centrally important for this insulation of individual mapk cascades.
objective the purpose of this study was to analyze patterns of mental health-related service utilization before and after hospitalization for attempting suicide.   methods this retrospective cohort study included all persons 15 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia (n=195) or depression (n=330) hospitalized in montreal, quebec, from april 2003 to december 2004 for attempting suicide. data on the publicly managed health and social services system were retrieved from the linked administrative databases of montreal's health and social services agency (april 2002 to march 2005). twelve-month preattempt service utilization profile, health care contacts three months pre- and postattempt, and predictors of postattempt service utilization were analyzed for two diagnostic groups (schizophrenia and depression).   results specialized outpatient care and hospital emergency departments were the services most used by both groups before and after attempting suicide. use of hospital emergency services as a primary care service did not adequately ensure aftercare, whereas prior contact with services and concurrent substance use disorder predicted greater service utilization postattempt among men but not women.   conclusions the publicly managed health and social services system in montreal seems to respond rather well to severe suicide attempts, including those by men with a concurrent substance use disorder known to be at high suicide risk. however, better coordination among hospital emergency departments, primary care, specialized mental health services, and addiction services is needed in order to enhance continuity of care. utilization of health care services has been found to differ between psychiatric disorders. however, the pattern of health care contacts among suicide attempters with mental disorders is not known. this study systematically investigated the pattern of health care contacts among suicide attempters with schizophrenia spectrum versus mood disorders with or without comorbid substance use disorders both before and after attempted suicide. all consecutive medically treated suicide attempters in helsinki from january 15, 1997, to january 14, 1998, were identified (n = 1,198). data were gathered on all their health care contacts within the 12 months before and after the index attempt. whereas the clear majority of all suicide attempters with schizophrenia spectrum or mood disorders had a treatment contact during the 30 days following the attempt, half of those with pure substance use disorders were without any contact with health care. comorbid substance use made treatment less likely after attempted suicide among both psychiatric disorder groups; those with schizophrenia spectrum and comorbid substance use disorders were seven times more often left without aftercare recommendation than those without substance use comorbidity. comorbid substance use disorders among suicide attempters with schizophrenia spectrum disorders decrease the likelihood of active aftercare, despite high suicide risk.
intracytoplasmic morphologically selected sperm injection (imsi, 6300× magnification with nomarski contrast) of a normal spermatozoon with a vacuole‐free head could improve the embryo's ability to grow to the blastocyst stage and then implant. however, the most relevant indications for imsi remain to be determined. to evaluate the potential value of imsi for patients with a high degree of sperm dna fragmentation (n = 8), different types of spermatozoa were analysed in terms of dna fragmentation. motile normal spermatozoa with a vacuole‐free head selected at 6300× magnification had a significantly lower mean dna fragmentation rate (4.1 ± 1.1%, n = 191) than all other types of spermatozoa: non‐selected spermatozoa (n = 8000; 26.1 ± 1.5% versus 4.1 ± 1.1%; p < 0.005), motile spermatozoa (n = 444; 20.8 ± 2.7% versus 4.1 ± 1.1%; p < 0.001) and motile, normal spermatozoa selected at 200× magnification (n = 370; 18.7 ± 2.7% versus 4.1 ± 1.1%; p < 0.001) and then motile, morphometrically normal spermatozoa with anterior vacuoles (n = 368; 15.9 ± 2.9% versus 4.1 ± 1.1%; p < 0.05) or posterior vacuoles (n = 402; 22.5 ± 3.6% versus 4.1 ± 1.1%; p < 0.001) selected at 6300× magnification. for patients with high sperm dna fragmentation rates, selection of normal spermatozoa with a vacuole‐free head (6300×) yields the greatest likelihood of obtaining spermatozoa with non‐fragmented dna. purposewe used computer assisted sperm selection (msome) during cycles of intracytoplasmic sperm injection to test whether this technique improves results over traditional icsi protocols. we also used the tunel assay to test whether msome could deselect physiologically abnormal spermatozoa.methodsindividual spermatozoa were examined with msome. normal and abnormal spermatozoa were tested for the level of dna fragmentation using tunel assay. in a prospective, randomized trial, patients were selected for standard icsi, or imsi techniques. we tested the two groups for biological and clinical parameters.results64.8% of spermatozoa, otherwise selectable for icsi, were characterized by abnormalities after computer-assisted sperm analysis. these sperm were also characterized by an increase in the level of dna fragmentation. we noted an increase in embryo quality, pregnancy and implantation rates after computerized sperm selection during icsi procedures.conclusionscomputerised selection of spermatozoa during icsi procedures deselects physiological abnormal spermatozoa and improves clinical results.
the fatty acid elongase 1 (fae1) gene is a key gene in the erucic acid biosynthesis in rapeseed. the complete coding sequences of the fae1 gene were isolated separately from eight high and zero erucic acid rapeseed cultivars (brassica napus l.). a four base pair deletion between t1366 and g1369 in the fae1 gene was found in a number of the cultivars, which leads to a frameshift mutation and a premature stop of the translation after the 466th amino acid residue. this deletion was predominantly found in the c-genome and rarely in the a-genome of b. napus. expression of the gene isoforms with the four base pair deletion in a yeast system generated truncated proteins with no enzymatic activity and could not produce very long chain fatty acids as the control with an intact fae1 gene did in yeast cells. in the developing rape seeds the fae1 gene isoforms with the four base pair deletion were transcribed normally but failed to translate proteins to form a functional complex. the four base pair deletion proved to be a mutation responsible for the low erucic acid trait in rapeseed and independent from the point mutation reported by han et al. (plant mol biol 46:229–239, 2001). genomic fatty acid elongation 1 (fae1) clones from high erucic acid (hea) brassica napus, brassica rapa and brassica oleracea, and low erucic acid (lea) b. napus cv. westar, were amplified by pcr and expressed in yeast cells under the control of the strong galactose-inducible promoter. as expected, yeast cells expressing the fae1 genes from hea brassica spp. synthesized very long chain monounsaturated fatty acids that are not normally found in yeast, while fatty acid profiles of yeast cells expressing the fae1 gene from lea b. napus were identical to control yeast samples. in agreement with published findings regarding different hea and lea b. napus cultivars, comparison of fae1 protein sequences from hea and lea brassicaceae revealed one crucial amino acid difference: the serine residue at position 282 of the hea fae1 sequences is substituted by phenylalanine in lea b. napus cv. westar. using site directed mutagenesis, the phenylalanine 282 residue was substituted with a serine residue in the fae1 polypeptide from b. napus cv. westar, the mutated gene was expressed in yeast and gc analysis revealed the presence of very long chain monounsaturated fatty acids (vlcmfas), indicating that the elongase activity was restored in the lea fae1 enzyme by the single amino acid substitution. thus, for the first time, the low erucic acid trait in canola b. napus can be attributed to a single amino acid substitution which prevents the biosynthesis of the eicosenoic and erucic acids.
lyophilization was evaluated in chitosan-calcium phosphate microspheres and scaffolds to improve drug delivery of growth factors and antibiotics for orthopedic applications. the dual delivery of an antibiotic and a growth factor from a composite scaffold would be beneficial for treatment of complex fracture sites, such as comminuted fractures and segmental bone defects. the aim of this investigation was to increase the loading capacity of the composite by taking advantage of the increased porosity, due to lyophilization, and to produce an extended elution profile using a secondary chitosan-bead coating. the physiochemical properties of the composite were investigated, and loading and elution studies were performed with alkaline phosphatase (alp), bone morphogenetic protein-2 (bmp-2), and amikacin. lyophilization was found to increase the surface area of scaffolds by over 400% and the porosity of scaffolds by 50%. using alp as a model protein, the loading capacity was increased by lyophilization from 4.3 +/- 2.5 to 24.6 +/- 3.6 microg alp/mg microspheres, and the elution profile was extended by a supplemental chitosan coating. the loading capacity of bmp-2 for composite microspheres was increased from 74.4 +/- 3.7 to 102.1 +/- 8.0 microg bmp-2/g microspheres with lyophilization compared with nonlyophilized microspheres. the elution profiles of bmp-2 and the antibiotic amikacin were not extended with the supplemental coating. additional investigations are planned to improve these elution characteristics for growth factors and antibiotics. our contemporary understanding of bone healing has evolved due to knowledge gleaned from a continuous interaction between basic laboratory investigations and clinical observations following procedures to augment healing of fractures, osseous defects, and unstable joints. the stages of bone healing parallel the early stages of bone development. the bone healing process is greatly influenced by a variety of systemic and local factors. a thorough understanding of the basic science of bone healing as well as the many factors that can affect it is critical to the management of a variety of musculoskeletal disorders. in particular, the evolving management of spinal disorders can greatly benefit from the advancement of our understanding of the principles of bone healing.
programmed cell death (apoptosis) is important in tissue maintenance. hallmarks of apoptosis include caspase activation, dna fragmentation and an overall reduction in cell volume. whether this apoptotic volume decrease (avd) is a mere response to initiators of apoptosis or whether it is functionally significant is not clear. in this study, we sought to answer this question using human malignant glioma cells as a model system. in vivo, high grade gliomas demonstrate an increased percentage of apoptotic cells as well as upregulation of death ligand receptors. by dynamically monitoring cell volume, we show that the induction of apoptosis, via activation of either the intrinsic or extrinsic pathways with staurosporine or trail, respectively, resulted in a rapid avd in d54-mg human glioma cells. this decrease in cell volume could be prevented by inhibiting the efflux of cl– through channels. such suppression of avd also reduced the activation of caspases 3, 8 and 9 and suppressed dna fragmentation. importantly, experimental manipulations that reduce the cell volume to 70% of the original volume for periods of at least 3 hours were sufficient to initiate apoptosis even in the absence of death ligands. hence, this data suggests that cell condensation is both necessary and sufficient for the induction of apoptosis. a common event that occurs during apoptosis is a loss of cell volume, but little information is available on its role in the cell death process. lymphocytes undergo apoptosis in response to glucocorticoids and exhibit cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, internucleosomal dna fragmentation, and apoptotic body formation. interestingly, only cells that exhibit a loss in cell volume degrade their dna. to determine if physical shrinkage was sufficient to initiate apoptosis, s49 neo lymphocytes were cultured in hypertonic medium. the normal osmolarity (approximately 300 mosm) of tissue culture medium was increased to either 550 or 800 mosm, using impermeant sugars such as mannitol and sucrose or nacl. these hypertonic conditions led to a rapid killing of s49 neo cells. evaluation of the mode of cell death revealed that these hypertonic conditions resulted in apoptosis. unlike glucocorticoid-induced cell death, hypertonically induced apoptosis did not require protein synthesis. when s49 neo cells were cultured under hypotonic conditions, the cells swelled but apoptosis did not occur. analysis of several cell types revealed that all lymphoid cells examined (s49 neo, cem-c7, primary thymocytes) undergo apoptosis in response to hypertonic conditions, whereas several other cell types (l cells, cos, hela, gh3) did not. although these nonlymphoid cells showed a similar initial reduction in cell volume in response to hypertonic conditions, they subsequently maintained volume or regulated back to a near normal cell volume. these data indicate that thymic lymphoid cells have the machinery in place for rapid induction of apoptosis in response to physical shrinkage, whereas other cell types resist shrinkage-induced apoptosis by the activation of cell volume regulatory mechanisms.
arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides (cpps) are promising transporters for intracellular delivery of antisense morpholino oligomers (pmo). here, we determined the effect of l-arginine, d-arginine and non-α amino acids on cellular uptake, splice-correction activity, cellular toxicity and serum binding for 24 cpp−pmos. insertion of 6-aminohexanoic acid (x) or β-alanine (b) residues into oligoarginine r8 decreased the cellular uptake but increased the splice-correction activity of the resulting compound, with a greater increase for the sequences containing more x residues. cellular toxicity was not observed for any of the conjugates up to 10 μm. up to 60 μm, only the conjugates with ⩾ 5 xs exhibited time- and concentration-dependent toxicity. substitution of l-arginine with d-arginine did not increase uptake or splice-correction activity. high concentration of serum significantly decreased the uptake and splice-correction activity of oligoarginine conjugates, but had much less effect on the conjugates containing x or b. in summary, incorporation of x/b into oligoarginine enhanced the antisense activity and serum-binding profile of cpp−pmo. toxicity of x/b-containing conjugates was affected by the number of xs, treatment time and concentration. more active, stable and less toxic cpps can be designed by optimizing the position and number of r, d-r, x and b residues. certain proteins contain subunits that enable their active translocation across the plasma membrane into cells. in the specific case of hiv-1, this subunit is the basic domain tat(49-57) (rkkrrqrrr). to establish the optimal structural requirements for this translocation process, and thereby to develop improved molecular transporters that could deliver agents into cells, a series of analogues of tat(49-57) were prepared and their cellular uptake into jurkat cells was determined by flow cytometry. all truncated and alanine-substituted analogues exhibited diminished cellular uptake, suggesting that the cationic residues of tat(49-57) play a principal role in its uptake. charge alone, however, is insufficient for transport as oligomers of several cationic amino acids (histidine, lysine, and ornithine) are less effective than tat(49-57) in cellular uptake. in contrast, a 9-mer of l-arginine (r9) was 20-fold more efficient than tat(49-57) at cellular uptake as determined by michaelis-menton kinetic analysis. the d-arginine oligomer (r9) exhibited an even greater uptake rate enhancement (>100-fold). collectively, these studies suggest that the guanidinium groups of tat(49-57) play a greater role in facilitating cellular uptake than either charge or backbone structure. based on this analysis, we designed and synthesized a class of polyguanidine peptoid derivatives. remarkably, the subset of peptoid analogues containing a six-methylene spacer between the guanidine head group and backbone (n-hxg), exhibited significantly enhanced cellular uptake compared to tat(49-57) and even to r9. overall, a transporter has been developed that is superior to tat(49-57), protease resistant, and more readily and economically prepared.
this study was conducted to measure the activity of the enzyme glutathione s-transferase (gst) in saliva and to compare the activity of this enzyme in children with and without dental fluorosis in communities with different concentrations of naturally fluoridated water. a total of 141 schoolchildren participated in this cross-sectional study. children were selected from two communities: one with a low (0.4 ppm) and the other with a high (1.8 ppm) water fluoride concentration. dental fluorosis was evaluated by applying the thylstrup and fejerskov index (tfi) criteria. stimulated saliva was obtained, and fluoride concentration and gst activity were measured. the gst activity was compared among children with different levels of dental fluorosis using multinomial logistic regression models and odds ratios (or). the mean age of the children was 10.6 (±1.03) years. approximately half of the children showed dental fluorosis (52.5 %). the average gst activity was 0.5678 (±0.1959) nmol/min/μg. a higher concentration of fluoride in the saliva was detected in children with a higher gst activity (p = 0.039). a multinomial logistic regression model used to evaluate the gst activity and the dental fluorosis score identified a strong association between tfi = 2–3 (or = 15.44, p = 0.007) and tfi ≥ 4 (or = 55.40, p = 0.026) and the gst activity level, compared with children showing tfi = 0–1, adjusted for age and sex. schoolchildren with higher levels of dental fluorosis and a higher fluoride concentration in the saliva showed greater gst activity. the increased gst activity most likely was the result of the body’s need to inactivate free radicals produced by exposure to fluoride. we studied the effects of combined exposure to arsenic and fluoride on (i) brain biogenic amines, oxidative stress and its correlation with glutathione and linked enzymes; (ii) alterations in the structural integrity of dna; and (iii) brain and blood arsenic and fluoride levels. efficacy of alpha-tocopherol in reducing these changes was also determined. male mice were exposed to sodium meta arsenite (50 ppm) and sodium fluoride (50 ppm) individually and in combination for ten weeks. animals were given vitamin e supplementation (5 mg/kg, i.m., alternate days) throughout the experiment. exposure to arsenic and fluoride significantly decreased the levels of brain biogenic amines. however; acetyl cholinesterase (ache) and monoamine oxidase (mao) activities showed an increase on fluoride exposure. there was also an increase in reactive oxygen species, thiobarbituric acid reactive species level, glutathione s-transferase and glutathione peroxidase activities and decreased superoxide dismutase activity, gsh:gssg ratio, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity. combined exposure to these toxicants produced more pronounced effects on ache, mao, sod and catalase activities. infrared spectra showed less toxicity during combined exposure as the characteristic peaks of cytosine and alpha-helical structure of dna were observed in normal and arsenic plus fluoride-exposed animals. vitamin e reduced brain fluoride level and tissue oxidative stress but had no effect on arsenic. combined exposure to arsenic and fluoride does not necessarily lead to more pronounced toxicity and interestingly exhibit some antagonistic effects. vitamin e supplementation may be of added value in reverting some of the toxic effects.
purposeoutcomes in primary mediastinal b cell lymphoma (pmbl) improved with the introduction of dose intense treatments, consolidation radiotherapy and rituximab. da-epoch-r, which omits radiotherapy has been adopted with worldwide enthusiasm, despite lack of proven superiority in randomized trials. we aimed to evaluate the course and outcome of pmbl using an alternative intensive rituximab-containing regimen, rchop-rice. we also evaluated the prognostic value of 18fdg-pet-ct (pet-ct).methodswe reviewed the clinical, laboratory and imaging data of pmbl patients receiving 1st-line treatment in hadassah medical center between 8/2002 and 10/2014.resultsof 47 pmbl patients, 24 (51 %) were treated with rchop-rice and 23 (49 %) with other protocols. overall, the 5-year progression-free survival was 93 % and the overall survival was 98 % (87 and 100 %, respectively, for the rchop-rice regimen). patient characteristics and treatment toxicities were balanced among protocols. a mean of 11.1 ± 1.3 hospitalization days/patient were needed to administer rchop-rice regimen compared to 37 ± 2 days/patient for da-epoch-r (n = 2). radiotherapy was given to 3 patients (12 %) treated with rchop-rice compared to 18 patients (78 %) treated with other protocols (p < 0.01). for patients followed with interim and end of treatment (eot) pet-ct, we observed a significant reduction in the uptake between the two (p < 0.0001). using a deauville score cutoff of 3, the negative and positive predictive values (npv and ppv) of eot pet-ct were 94 and 33 %, respectively.conclusionsthe rchop-rice protocol results in excellent survival outcomes, generally permits omission of rt and is simpler to administer than da-epoch-r. interim pet-ct in pmbl may be unjustified; however, eot deauville scores ≤3 predicts a favorable outcome. between 1981 and 1986, 126 patients with diffuse large cell lymphoma were treated with macop-b (methotrexate/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide/vincristine/prednisone/bleomy cin). all had advanced-stage lymphoma (ann arbor stage iii or iv or stage i or ii if the tumor mass was greater than 10 cm or b symptoms were present). the complete response (cr) rate was 84% and the toxic death rate was 6%. actuarial overall survival at 3 years was 67% and at 8 years 62%; the failure-free survival at 8 years was 52%. the follow-up for macop-b is 39 to 106 months (median 76) for living patients. a multivariate prognostic factor analysis for this group of patients identified age greater than 60 years. b symptoms, more than one extranodal site of disease, and more than three nodal sites of disease as the four significant prognostic variables. from june 1986, 108 patients were enrolled on a modification of macop-b called vacop-b (etoposide/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide/vincristine/prednisone/bleomycin ). their cr rate was 81%, and the toxic death rate was lower, at 3%. the 60% overall survival at 3 years is not statistically significantly different from that of macop-b. the incidence of moderate or severe mucositis and cushingoid changes was much lower with vacop-b. the mopp/abv (mechlorethamine/vincristine/procarbazine/prednisone- doxorubicin/bleomycin/vinblastine) hybrid chemotherapy regimen for advanced-stage hodgkin's disease was standard therapy from april 1981 to june 1988 for untreated patients aged 16 to 65. advanced stage was defined as stages iib, iiib, iii2a, iva, ivb, or stages iia or iiia with greater than four splenic nodules or a mediastinal mass greater than one third of the transthoracic diameter.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
aims: the purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of salmonella in pigs at the moment of slaughter and in the slaughterhouse environment. swine slaughter is an open process with many opportunities for the contamination of the pork carcass with potentially pathogenic bacteria; however, it does not contain any point where hazards are completely eliminated. data on the prevalence of various pathogenic bacteria (aeromonas hydrophila, campylobacter coli/jejuni, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus and yersinia enterocolitica) in pigs, their growth and survival characteristics and ability to become established on the slaughter line are presented. the presentation covers the processing steps from lairage to chilling and is based on swine slaughter practices in denmark, norway and sweden. the major contamination points during swine slaughter are pig-related, such as faecal and pharyngeal, and environmental. haccp (hazard analysis critical control point) and gmp (good manufacturing practice) in swine slaughter must be focused on limiting this spread. the pathogenic bacteria show differences in their general mechanism of distribution. the major contamination source of campylobacter spp., salmonella spp. and y. enterocolitica is the pig, and the contamination of carcasses with these bacteria may be limited, provided that only strict slaughtering procedures are used. other organisms such as aeromonas spp., l. moncytogenes/listeria spp. and s. aureus can be endemic in the processing environment. since endemic bacteria can be controlled by proper cleaning and disinfection, these organisms are useful as indicators for the success of gmp rules. the following affiliation to cps or ccps made for specific steps during slaughter and dressing may serve as a guidance: (i) lairage (cp), (ii) killing (cp), (iii) scalding (cp), (iv) dehairing (cp), (v) singeing/flaming (cp), (vi) polishing (cp), (vii) circumanal incision and removal of the intestines (ccp), (viii) excision of the tongue, pharynx, and in particular the tonsils (ccp), (ix) splitting (cp), (x) post mortem inspection procedures (ccp) and (xi) deboning of the head (ccp).
background the most common adverse effects of oral isotretinoin are cheilitis, skin dryness, dry eyes, and conjunctivitis, whereas evening primrose oil (epo) is known to improve skin moisture and transepidermal water loss (tewl) in healthy adults and atopic patients. objective to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of epo in preventing xerotic cheilitis in acne patients being treated with oral isotretinoin. methods forty korean volunteers of fitzpatrick skin types iii and iv, having moderate acne, were enrolled and randomized to receive either isotretinoin with or without epo for 8 weeks. the efficacy of treatment was evaluated on the basis of global acne grading system scores, number of inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions, tewl, corneometry, physician's global assessment, and patient satisfaction. results the results after 8 weeks of treatment showed that the tewl of the lip increased significantly during isotretinoin treatment, whereas the tewl of the hand dorsum showed no significant change. the increase of the tewl of the lip was more definite in the control group than in the experimental group. the number of acne lesions decreased significantly in both groups, and there were no differences between them. conclusion our study suggests that the addition of epo improved xerotic cheilitis in acne patients being treated with oral isotretinoin. however, besides tewl and corneometry assessments, additional studies are required for a complete understanding of the role of epo in xerotic cheilitis in acne patients being treated with oral isotretinoin. fats are prevalent in western diets; they have known deleterious effects on muscle insulin resistance and may contribute to bone loss. however, relationships between fatty acids and locomotor system dysfunctions in elderly population remain controversial. the aim of this study was to analyze the impact of fatty acid quality on the age related evolution of the locomotor system and to understand which aging mechanisms are involved. in order to analyze age related complications, the samp8 mouse strain was chosen as a progeria model as compared to the samr1 control strain. then, two months old mice were divided in different groups and subjected to the following diets : (1) standard "growth" diet - (2) "sunflower" diet (high ω6/ω3 ratio) - (3) "borage" diet (high γ-linolenic acid) - (4) "fish" diet (high in long chain ω3). mice were fed ad libitum through the whole protocol. at 12 months old, the mice were sacrificed and tissues were harvested for bone studies, fat and muscle mass measures, inflammation parameters and bone cell marker expression. we demonstrated for the first time that borage and fish diets restored inflammation and bone parameters using an original model of senile osteoporosis that mimics clinical features of aging in humans. therefore, our study strongly encourages nutritional approaches as relevant and promising strategies for preventing aged-related locomotor dysfunctions.
bile salts are essential for phospholipid secretion into the bile. to study the relevance of the structure of phospholipids for their interaction with bile salts, we used spin-labeled or fluorescent phospholipid analogues of different head groups and acyl chain length. those analogues form micelles in aqueous suspension. their solubilization by bile salts resulting in the formation of mixed micelles was followed by the decrease of spin-spin interaction of spin-labeled analogues or by the relief of fluorescence self-quenching of (7-nitro-2-1,3-benzooxadiazol (nbd))-labeled analogues. solubilization of analogue micelles occurred at and above the critical micellar concentration (cmc) of the bile salts. as revealed by stopped-flow technique, solubilization of nbd-analogues was very rapid with half times as low as 0.1 sec above the cmc of taurocholate. both kinetics and extent of solubilization were independent of the phospholipid head group, but were significantly affected by the fatty acid chain length. furthermore, using vesicles with varying phospholipid composition and different types of analogues in self-quenching concentrations, we could show that bile salt-mediated vesicle solubilization depended on the fatty acid chain length of phospholipids. in contrast, neither for phospholipids nor for analogues could an influence of the lipid head group on the solubilization process be observed. these findings support a head group-independent mechanism of bile salt-mediated enrichment of specific phospholipids in the bile fluid. using complementary physical-chemical methods including turbidimetry, quasielastic light scattering, gel filtration, and phase analysis, we examined the interactions between dilute concentrations of the common bile salt, taurochenodeoxycholate (tcdc), and uni- and multilamellar vesicles (mlvs) composed of defined molecular species of lecithin (l) and varying contents of cholesterol (ch). dissolution rates of mlvs with micellar tcdc, as assessed by turbidimetry, were more rapid with vesicles composed of sn-1 palmitoyl species, typical of biliary l, compared with those composed of the more hydrophobic sn-1 stearoyl species. incorporation of ch retarded mlv dissolution rates in proportion to the ch content, and only at high ch contents were dissolution rates appreciably influenced by the sn-2 fatty acid composition of l. when mlvs contained ch in amounts characteristic of intracellular membranes (ch/l approximately 0.1), the dissolution rates of the individual l species by tcdc accurately predicted the steady state l composition of human bile. tcdc interacted with small unilamellar l/ch vesicles (suvs) at concentrations well below, as well as appreciably above, its critical micellar concentration. in accordance with the tcdc-egg yolk l-h2o phase diagram, perimicellar concentrations of tcdc interacted with suvs to form aggregates that were approximately twice the size of the suvs. these were consistent with the formation of a dispersed hexagonal (rod-like) phase, which co-existed with aqueous bile salt (bs) monomers and either micellar or unilamellar suv phases. micellar tcdc completely solubilized suvs as mixed micelles, putatively via this transient hexagonal phase. with modest ch-supersaturation, dissolution was followed by the reemergence of a new vesicle population that coexisted metastably with mixed micelles. with high ch supersaturation, tcdc extracted l and ch molecules from suvs in different proportions to form ch-supersaturated mixed micelles and ch-enriched suvs, in accordance with the metastable phase diagram. these experiments are consistent with the hypothesis that sn-1 palmitoyl l species are subselected for bile, in part, by physical-chemical interactions of intracellular bs concentrations with ch-poor membranes and that the subsequent evolution of ch-rich vesicles and ch-saturated mixed micelles occurs via a transitional hexagonal (rod) phase. these liquid-crystalline states are likely to be transient in ch-unsaturated biles, but may persist in ch-supersaturated human biles because of their high ch contents which retard or inhibit these phase transitions.
the al-induced release of organic acid has been suggested as an important mechanism for al resistance in plants. in this study, the effect of k-252a and abscisic acid (aba) on the efflux of citrate was investigated in soybean (glycine max l.) roots. al initiated citrate efflux from the root apices 30 min after the addition of al. the al-triggered efflux of citrate was sensitive to metabolic inhibitors and anion channel inhibitors. pretreatment or treatment with k-252a, an inhibitor of protein kinase, severely inhibited the al-induced efflux of citrate accompanying an increase in al accumulation and intensified al-induced root growth inhibition. al-treatment increased the endogenous level of abscisic acid (aba) in soybean roots in a dose- and time-dependent manner, while k-252a failed to inhibit the al-induced increase in endogenous aba. exogenous application of aba increased the activity of citrate synthase (ec 4.1.3.7) by 26.2%, and decreased al accumulation by 32.3%, respectively. aba-induced increases in citrate efflux and root elongation were suppressed by k-252a, while aba could not reverse the k-252a effects. taken together, these results suggest that aba is probably involved in the early response, after which k-252a-sensitive protein kinases play a key step in regulating the activity of an anion channel, through which citrate is released from the apical cells of soybean roots. in many plants, efflux of organic anions from roots has been proposed as one of the major al resistance mechanisms. however it remains unknown how plants regulate efflux of organic anions in response to al. in this study, the regulatory mechanisms of al-responsive malate efflux in wheat (triticum aestivum) were characterized focusing on the role of protein phosphorylation. al-resistant wheat (cv atlas) initiated malate efflux at 5 min after addition of al, and this response was sensitive to temperature. k-252a, a broad range inhibitor of protein kinases, effectively blocked the al-induced malate efflux accompanied with an increased accumulation of al and intensified al-induced root growth inhibition. a transient activation of a 48-kd protein kinase and an irreversible repression of a 42-kd protein kinase were observed preceding the initiation of malate efflux, and these changes were canceled by k-252a. malate efflux was accompanied with a rapid decrease in the contents of organic anions in the root apex, such as citrate, succinate, and malate but with no change in the contents of inorganic anions such as chloride, nitrate, and phosphate. these results suggest that protein phosphorylation is involved in the al-responsive malate efflux in the wheat root apex and that the organic anion-specific channel might be a terminal target that responds to al signaling mediated by phosphorylation.
the aim of this study was to characterize and identify the mode of action of ic31®, a two-component vaccine adjuvant. we found that ic31® was accumulated in human peripheral blood monocytes, mhc class ii positive cells and monocyte-derived dcs (modcs) but not in plasmacytoid dcs (pdcs). in the presence of ic31® the differentiation of inflammatory cd1a+ modcs and the secretion of chemokines, tnf-α and il-6 cytokines was inhibited but the production of ifnβ was increased. sustained addition of ic31® to differentiating modcs interfered with iκbα phosphorylation, while the level of phospho-irf3 increased. we also showed that both ic31® and its klk component exhibited a booster effect on type i ifn responses induced by the specific ligands of tlr3 or tlr7/8, whereas tlr9 ligand induces type i ifn production only in the presence of ic31® or odn1. furthermore, long term incubation of modcs with ic31® caused significantly higher expression of irf and ifn genes than a single 24 hr treatment. the adjuvant activity of ic31® on the ifn response was shown to be exerted through tlrs residing in the vesicular compartment of modcs. based on these results ic31® was identified as a modc modulatory adjuvant that sets the balance of the nf-κb and irf3 mediated signaling pathways to the production of ifnβ. thus ic31® is emerging as a potent adjuvant to increase immune responses against intracellular pathogens and cancer in future vaccination strategies. plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pdcs) are unique with respect to their capacity to produce unsurpassed amounts of ifn-α and coexpress tlr7 and tlr9, mediating ifn-α production. although tlrs are critical receptors of innate immunity, little is known about the immunological effects of tlr7/tlr9 costimulation. we have analyzed the effects of tlr7/tlr9 costimulation on ifn-α production by leukocytes and pdcs. our experiments revealed that both synthetic (resiquimod and loxoribine) and natural (ssrna40) tlr7 ligands abrogate cpg-a- and cpg-c-oligodeoxynucleotide (odn)-induced ifn-α production by human leukocytes. because tlr7 ligands themselves represent important ifn-α inducers, we demonstrated that substimulatory tlr7 ligand concentrations significantly inhibited cpg-a-induced ifn-α. delayed addition of tlr7 ligands still resulted in complete suppression of cpg-a-odn-induced ifn-α production, suggesting that the inhibition is unlikely to be caused by a kinetic uptake advantage. unlike for cpg-a and cpg-c, tlr7 ligands did not inhibit cpg-b-odn-induced ifn-α production. experiments with purified human pdcs demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of tlr7/tlr9 costimulation were mediated directly by pdcs. suppression of ifn-α production was not related to increased cell death and was also detectable in enriched mouse pdcs. analyses of pdcs suggested that the tlr7 signal regulates the outcome of tlr7 ligand/cpg-a-odn costimulation and can either inhibit (ifn-α) or promote (il-8/cd40) cytokine and surface marker expression. our data reveal for the first time a strong inhibitory effect of tlr7 stimulation on ifn-α production induced by cpg-a- and cpg-c-odns. these findings provide novel insight into the effects of tlr7/tlr9 costimulation and may support the development of novel tlr9 inhibitors.
in numerous languages determiner forms depend not only on semantic information but also on several other kinds of information, such as the grammatical gender of the controlling noun or the phonological properties of the context. in the present research we contrasted two possible accounts of determiner retrieval: one in which every type of required information is bundled into a unitized representation for determiner retrieval and one in which each type of information can individually activate determiner forms. these alternative hypotheses were investigated in three experiments in which native speakers of french named pictures with simple [determiner + noun] or complex [determiner + adjective + noun] noun phrases. in the experiments, the properties of the contextual cues that drive the retrieval of the determiner were manipulated - for example, we manipulated the number of determiner forms that are compatible with a given grammatical gender and the number of grammatical genders that a given determiner form can be used with. neither hypothesis can fully account for the results of the three experiments. however, a hybrid hypothesis that combines the principal features of the two hypotheses provides a good account of the data. in five picture-word interference experiments we explore the gender congruity effect observed in dutch in two languages, spanish and catalan. participants' performance was not affected by the relationship between the gender of the picture and the gender of the word. the results show that the gender congruity effect is not a universal effect, but varies from language to language, depending on crucial characteristics of the gender/determiner selection system used to process a given language. consistent with the crosslinguistic hypothesis presented by miozzo and caramazza we argue that the retrieval of the noun's gender is enough to specify the determiner's phonological form in dutch, but not in catalan or spanish, and this is the cause of the failure to replicate the dutch results in these two languages.
background: the use of dots on the nose, and chin as markers for measuring occlusal vertical dimension is common in complete denture construction. therefore, it is important to evaluate the accuracy of facial measurements while assessing occlusal vertical dimension in edentulous patients. materials and methods: the study was carried out on 28 edentulous patients. occlusion rims were constructed, a central bearing-screw attached to the lower occlusion rim, and a central-bearing plate was attached to the upper occlusion rim. then the occlusal vertical dimension was increased at predetermined amount (3, and 5 mm) by counting the number of flutes of the central bearing screw, and the corresponding facial measurements recorded by the use of a caliper device to the nearest 0.1 mm. results: it was found that 3 mm increase in skeletal height corresponded to mean facial increase of 1.81 mm and ranged between 1-3.5 mm, while 5 mm increase in skeletal height, correspond to mean facial increase of 3.56 mm and ranged between 2.1-5.3 mm. conclusions: alteration of vertical skeletal relationships is corresponding with less alteration in facial movement between reference marks above, and below the mouth. this suggests that depending on facial marks when assessing occlusal vertical dimension is not very accurate. in a group of nine dentate students with a mean age of 23.1 years, a comparison of their interocclusal distances was determined using tooth and chin reference points. this determination was made with two reference leds, one attached to a lower tooth and the other attached to a point on the chin. these two leds were registered simultaneously using the selspot system and analyzed with the use of a computer. three different methods were used to establish the interocclusal distance: a phonetic method, a relaxation method, and a swallowing method. independent of the method selected, there was a greater interocclusal distance recorded by the tooth-attached reference led. this study indicates that, in the clinical determination of interocclusal distance, where a chin reference is used the dentist should be aware of this difference--especially when lip activity is involved.
aims the efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, and placebo were compared in patients with the metabolic syndrome.   methods and results patients with the metabolic syndrome with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldl-c) > or =3.36 mmol/l (130 mg/dl) and multiple risk factors conferring a 10-year coronary heart disease risk score of >10% were randomized (2:2:1) to receive rosuvastatin 10 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg, or placebo for 6 weeks. subsequently, the rosuvastatin 10 mg and placebo groups received rosuvastatin 20 mg and the atorvastatin 10 mg group received atorvastatin 20 mg for 6 weeks. ldl-c was reduced significantly more in patients receiving rosuvastatin 10 mg when compared with those receiving atorvastatin 10 mg at 6 weeks [intention-to-treat (itt) population by randomized treatment: 41.7 vs. 35.7%, p < 0.001; itt population by as-allocated treatment: 42.7 vs. 36.6%, p < 0.001]. significant ldl-c reductions were also observed in patients receiving rosuvastatin when compared with those receiving atorvastatin at 12 weeks (48.9 vs. 42.5%, p < 0.001). more patients achieved ldl-c goals with rosuvastatin when compared with atorvastatin. rosuvastatin increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly more than atorvastatin. treatments were well tolerated.   conclusion at equivalent doses, rosuvastatin had a significantly greater effect than atorvastatin in lowering ldl-c and improving the lipid profile and was well tolerated in patients with the metabolic syndrome. emerging data suggest that the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a (hmg-coa) reductase inhibitors (statins) offer important benefits for the large population of individuals at high risk for coronary heart disease. this population encompasses a sizable portion of individuals who are also at high risk for drug-drug interactions due to their need for multiple medications. in general, statins are associated with a very small risk for myopathy (which may progress to fatal or nonfatal rhabdomyolysis); however, the potential for drug-drug interactions is known to increase this risk in specific high-risk groups. the incidence of myopathy associated with statin therapy is dose related and is increased when statins are used in combination with agents that share common metabolic pathways. of particular concern is the potential for interactions with other lipid-lowering agents such as fibrates and niacin (nicotinic acid), which may be used in patients with mixed lipidemia, and with immunosuppressive agents, such as cyclosporine, which are commonly used in patients after transplantation. clinicians should be alert to the potential for drug-drug interactions to minimize the risk of myopathy during long-term statin therapy in patients at high risk for coronary heart disease.
runx1 is a master transcription factor in hematopoiesis and mediates the specification and homeostasis of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (hspcs). disruptions in runx1 are well known to lead to hematologic disease. in this study, we sought to identify and characterize runx1 target genes in hspcs by performing runx1 chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing (chip-seq) using a murine hspc line and complementing this data with our previously described gene expression profiling of primary wild-type and runx1-deficient hspcs (lineage(-)/ckit(+)/sca1(+)). from this analysis, we identified and confirmed that hmga2, a known oncogene, as a direct target of runx1. hmga2 was strongly upregulated in runx1-deficient hspcs, and the promoter of hmga2 was responsive in a cell-type dependent manner upon coexpression of runx1. conditional runx1 knockout mice exhibit expansion of their hspcs and myeloid progenitors as hallmark phenotypes. to further validate and establish that hmga2 plays a role in inducing hspc expansion, we generated mouse models of hmga2 and runx1 deficiency. although mice lacking both factors continued to display higher frequencies of hspcs, the expansion of myeloid progenitors was effectively rescued. the data presented here establish hmga2 as a transcriptional target of runx1 and a critical regulator of myeloid progenitor expansion. we present model-based analysis of chip-seq data, macs, which analyzes data generated by short read sequencers such as solexa's genome analyzer. macs empirically models the shift size of chip-seq tags, and uses it to improve the spatial resolution of predicted binding sites. macs also uses a dynamic poisson distribution to effectively capture local biases in the genome, allowing for more robust predictions. macs compares favorably to existing chip-seq peak-finding algorithms, and is freely available.
abstract. varicella can be prevented by vaccination using the live-attenuated oka vaccine strain of varicella zoster virus (vzv). only mild breakthrough disease has been reported in seronegative vaccinees when exposed to the wild-type virus. the latent varicella vaccine virus has rarely caused herpes zoster in childhood and adolescence. we report a healthy 2-year-old girl who developed an impressive herpes zoster infection 16 months after vaccination, localised in three cervical dermatoma. as causative virus, vzv vaccine strain was identified by polymerase chain reaction and analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the amplified products. conclusion: vaccine varicella zoster virus can occasionally reactivate in healthy children and present as herpes zoster. virus characterisation is necessary to identify the strain and provide information on the incidence of occurrence. background the oka strain of live attenuated varicella vaccine is immunogenic and highly protective, but there has been concern about the risk of zoster after immunization.   methods we examined the incidence of zoster, risk factors for it, and measures of immune response in children with leukemia who received the vaccine and in appropriate controls.   results after a mean follow-up of 4.1 years, zoster was documented in 13 of the 548 vaccinated children with leukemia (2.4 percent). in a subgroup of 96 vaccinated children matched prospectively with 96 children with leukemia who had had natural varicella infections, there were 4 cases of zoster among the vaccinated children and 15 among the controls, for crude incidence rates of 0.80 and 2.46 cases per 100 person-years, respectively (p = 0.01). of the total of 13 vaccinated children who had zoster, 11 had a skin rash due to varicella-zoster virus, either from the vaccine itself or from breakthrough varicella after household exposure in the period between immunization and the documentation of zoster. in the 268 children who had any type of rash caused by varicella-zoster virus after vaccination, as compared with those who did not have a rash, the relative risk of subsequent zoster was 5.75. for the 21 vaccinated children who received bone marrow transplants, as compared with those who did not, the relative risk of zoster was 7.5. cell-mediated immunity as assessed by lymphocyte stimulation was lower in 4 children in whom zoster later developed than in 29 controls who had been vaccinated but who did not have zoster (mean stimulation index, 5.1 vs. 23.8; p = 0.0001).   conclusions in children with leukemia who receive the live attenuated varicella vaccine, the subsequent incidence of zoster is lower than in children who have natural varicella infections.
natalizumab (ntz) is a monoclonal antibody targeting the α4β1 integrin (cd49d/cd29), very late antigen-4 (vla-4), which is approved for treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (rr-ms). a possible association between ntz treatment and a higher risk of melanoma is under debate. natural killer (nk) cells, which express vla-4, represent an innate barrier limiting spreading of melanoma under steady state conditions. indeed, because of their expression of activating receptors, they are very efficient in recognizing and killing melanoma cells without the need of a previous priming. for this reason, we aimed at assessing whether nk-cell functions might be impaired by sustained exposure to ntz. to investigate this possibility we isolated nk cells from healthy donors and tested their cytotoxic and migratory functions against primary melanoma cells derived from subcutaneous and lymph node metastases. flow cytometry analysis demonstrated expression of cd49d on both freshly isolated nk cells and activated nk cells. moreover, vla-4 and its receptor, vascular cell adhesion protein-1 (vcam-1) were similarly expressed on freshly isolated nk cells. however, upon a short exposure to ntz, expression of vla-4 on nk cells decreased. analysis of nk receptor expression upon exposure of nk cells from three healthy donors to ntz indicated that dnam-1 and nkp46 are apparently decreased, while nkg2a is increased. the degranulation of nk cells towards melanoma cells, which express both vla-4 and vcam-1, was not affected when ntz was added to the co-culture or when both nk cells and melanoma cells were each pre-exposed to ntz for over 12h. in contrast, degranulation was significantly inhibited after 48h of pre-incubation indicating that ntz can influence nk-cell degranulation towards melanoma cells only after a prolonged exposure. using a migration chamber assay, we observed that the migration of nk cells towards melanoma cells was dependent upon the concentration of melanoma cells in the lower chamber, and that it was significantly reduced in presence of ntz. our results show that upon exposure to ntz both cytolytic activity and migration toward melanoma cells were affected, suggesting that binding of ntz to nk cells affects pathways involved in these nk-cell functions. we analyzed the expression of cd49d on nk cells from ms patients treated with ntz and observed that it decreases with time of treatment. these data suggest that blockade of vla-4 on nk-cell surface alters some key functions involved in the immune surveillance toward melanoma by nk cells and may provide a mechanistic explanation for the reported occurrence of melanoma in ms patients treated with ntz. background natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against α₄ integrin used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (ms). four cases of melanomas occurring in patients prescribed natalizumab to treat ms were recently reported. although some fundamental data suggested that α₄β1 integrin could be linked to the invasiveness of melanoma, none showed any relation with the transformation of melanocytes.   observations we performed a prospective follow-up of a cohort of patients with ms treated with natalizumab to assess the evolution of nevi under treatment. clinical dermatologic examination and videodermoscopy were performed every 6 months. nevi were compared side-by-side with baseline photographs, and histologic analysis was proposed based on clinical and dermoscopic criteria. forty-four patients were included, and 248 nevi were examined and followed up. the mean duration of follow-up was 14 months (range, 6-20 months). seventeen lesions (6.8%) showed modifications over time. only 12 (4.8%) presented substantial dermoscopic changes. five lesions were removed. all of them were classified as benign after histologic examination.   conclusions our results showed the same rate of clinical and dermoscopic changes of nevi during treatment with natalizumab compared with the spontaneous evolution of nevi reported in literature. in accordance with fundamental data, those results suggest that the inhibition of the α₄ integrin does not promote the transformation of melanocytic lesions.
background eliminating catheter-associated urinary tract infections (cauti) is at the forefront of quality improvement and cost reduction for payers and hospitals alike. herein we describe a double-focused strategy to eliminate cauti's on a surgical oncology unit over the course of 24 mo.   methods cauti's were tracked on a 30-bed surgical oncology unit 12 mo before and 12 mo after implementation of specific measures aimed at (1) decreasing utilization and (2) increasing catheter bundle and hand hygiene compliance. a policy of early foley catheter removal was implemented. univariate analyses were performed comparing nominal and numerical variables between the pre- and post-intervention groups.   results the pre- and post-intervention groups comprised of 1376 and 1467 patients, respectively. postintervention, there was a significant decrease in both total foley (p = 0.02) and patient (p = 0.03) days. this resulted in a significant reduction in utilization rate from 0.28 to 0.24, (p < 0.0001) and median cauti rate from 4.6 to 0.0 (p = 0.03). reduced cautis were associated with significant improvements in monthly bundle compliance at ≥95% (75% versus 17%, p = 0.003) and hand hygiene compliance at ≥95% (92% versus 58%, p = 0.05). among our thoracic epidural cohort (n = 11), three patients (27%) required reinsertion for urinary retention. none of these epidural patients were diagnosed with a cauti.   conclusions although not eliminated entirely, cautis on our unit were significantly reduced through decreased utilization and improved compliance to institutional patient safety measures. adoption of these strategies to other inpatient units would not only improve patient safety but also result in significant cost savings. background and objectives: it is common practice to catheterize the bladder in the presence of epidural analgesia and to leave the bladder catheter in situ to avoid postoperative urinary retention. however, bladder catheterization carries the risk for urinary tract infection (uti). the objective of this randomized control trial was to assess whether the incidence of uti will differ among patients receiving standard care and patients who have the bladder catheterization discontinued on the morning after surgery with the epidural still functioning. methods: patients at low risk for postoperative urinary retention, scheduled for thoracic and abdominal surgery and receiving continuous thoracic epidural analgesia, were randomized on the morning after surgery to 2 groups: in the early removal group (n = 105), the bladder catheter was removed on the same morning after surgery, whereas in the standard group (sg) (n = 110), the bladder catheter was removed when epidural analgesia was discontinued (3-5 days). urinary bladder volume was assessed by ultrasound. primary and secondary outcomes were the incidence of uti and rate of recatheterization. results: two hundred fifteen patients were randomized. there were 17 uti cases in total, with 15 (14%) in the sg and 2 (2%) in the early removal group (p = 0.004). the incidence of recatheterizations was not different between the 2 groups (p = 0.09) and did not correlate with the site of epidural insertion. when matched for the types of surgery, the duration of hospital stay was longer in the patients who contracted uti (p = 0.004). there were more patients older than 65 years in the sg. conclusions: leaving the bladder catheter as long as the epidural analgesia is maintained results in a higher incidence of uti and prolonged hospital stay. removal of the bladder catheter on the morning after surgery does not lead to higher rate of catheterizations.
backgrounda decade of conflict in chechnya destroyed infrastructure and resulted in widespread exposure to violence. amidst substantial reconstruction, periodic violence has contributed to an ongoing atmosphere of insecurity. we conducted a qualitative study to understand the mental health and psychosocial problems affecting adult chechens in this context to inform development of assessment tools for an evaluation study related to individual counseling.methodsdata were collected in july 2014. a convenience sample of 59 chechen adults was asked to free list all problems affecting people in the area. four problems were explored further in 19 key interviewee (ki) interviews, with respondents identified using snowball sampling. data analysis was conducted in russian by the chechen interviewers.resultsmultiple mental health and psychosocial problems emerged, including ‘bad psychological health’, ‘depression’, ‘stress and nervous people’, and ‘problems in the family’. aggression, ‘emotional blowing’, and ‘not adequate’ behavior were frequently reported indicators of these problems, with negative effects on the whole family. chechens reported seeking help through informal social networks, psychiatric and psychological services, and islamic centers.conclusionchechens reported mental health and psychosocial problems similar to those experienced in other post-conflict settings. the description of ‘emotional blowing’ mirrored prior findings in chechen asylum seekers and fits within a cluster of cultural concepts of distress featuring anger that has been identified in other conflict-affected populations. further exploration of the nature and prevalence of this construct, as well as evaluations of interventions aimed at reducing these symptoms, is warranted. historically, organized violence has been a chronic pervasive problem in haiti. we set out to elicit haitians’ views on its effects to guide the development of interventions. in march 2006 we studied a population in the slum area of cap-haitien, haiti’s second largest city, and the nearby towns of milot and limbe. a convenience sample of adults was asked to free list all current problems affecting victims of organized violence. two major categories emerged: psychological problems and financial problems. the psychological problems of “feeling startled and loss of self control,” “sadness/grief,” “continuing to suffer from reliving/reexperiencing past events,” “problems in the head/mental problems,” “deep suffering in the heart,” and “thinking too much” emerged as themes from key-informant interviews. these may correspond to constructs of depression, dysthymia, and anxiety disorders including posttraumatic stress disorder in psychiatric nosology. the development of effective interventions can therefore consider those known to be effective for these problems in other settings. however in selecting interventions, considerations must also include local acceptability, perceived causes of problems, and their social effects.
ecological communities are increasingly exposed to multiple chemical and physical stressors, but distinguishing anthropogenic impacts from other environmental drivers remains challenging. rarely are multiple stressors investigated in replicated studies over large spatial scales (>1000 kms) or supported with manipulations that are necessary to interpret ecological patterns. we measured the composition of sediment infaunal communities in relation to anthropogenic and natural stressors at multiple sites within seven estuaries. we observed increases in the richness and abundance of polychaete worms in heavily modified estuaries with severe metal contamination, but no changes in the diversity or abundance of other taxa. estuaries in which toxic contaminants were elevated also showed evidence of organic enrichment. we hypothesised that the observed response of polychaetes was not a ‘positive’ response to toxic contamination or a reduction in biotic competition, but due to high levels of nutrients in heavily modified estuaries driving productivity in the water column and enriching the sediment over large spatial scales. we deployed defaunated field-collected sediments from the surveyed estuaries in a small scale experiment, but observed no effects of sediment characteristics (toxic or enriching). furthermore, invertebrate recruitment instead reflected the low diversity and abundance observed during field surveys of this relatively ‘pristine’ estuary. this suggests that differences observed in the survey are not a direct consequence of sediment characteristics (even severe metal contamination) but are related to parameters that covary with estuary modification such as enhanced productivity from nutrient inputs and the diversity of the local species pool. this has implications for the interpretation of diversity measures in large-scale monitoring studies in which the observed patterns may be strongly influenced by many factors that covary with anthropogenic modification. we examine macrofaunal and physico-chemical responses to organic enrichment beneath salmon farms in contrasting flow environments, and reveal pronounced flow-related differences in the magnitude and spatial extent of effects. total macrofaunal abundances at high flow sites were nearly an order of magnitude greater than at comparable low flow sites, representing a significant benthic biomass. these very high abundances occurred in conjunction with moderate-to-high species richness, and were evident in the absence of appreciable organic matter accumulation. biological responses to increasing sulfide were variable; however a significant biological threshold was evident at 1500 μm. macrofaunal responses at high flow sites differed substantially from the pearson-rosenberg model. the atypical ecological conditions were attributed to (i) limited accumulation of fine sediments, (ii) maintenance of aerobic conditions in near-surface sediments, and (iii) an abundant food supply. thus, enhanced resilience to organic waste at well-flushed sites appears related to both biological and physical processes.
connexin 43 (cx43) deficiency increases myocardial tolerance to ischemia–reperfusion injury and abolishes preconditioning protection. it is not known whether modifications in baseline signaling through protective risk or safe pathways or in response to preconditioning may contribute to these effects. to answer this question we used cx43cre−er(t)/fl mice, in which cx43 expression is abolished after 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-oht) administration. isolated hearts from cx43cre−er(t)/fl mice, or from cx43fl/fl controls, treated with vehicle or 4-oht, were submitted to global ischemia (40 min) and reperfusion. cx43 deficiency was associated with reduced infarct size after ischemia–reperfusion (11.17 ± 3.25 % vs. 65.04 ± 3.79, 59.31 ± 5.36 and 65.40 ± 4.91, in cx43fl/fl animals treated with vehicle, cx43fl/fl mice treated with 4-oht, and cx43cre−er(t)/fl mice treated with vehicle, respectively, n = 8–9, p < 0.001). however, the ratio phosphorylated/total protein expression for akt, erk-1/2, gsk3β and stat3 was not increased in normoxic samples from animals lacking cx43. instead, a reduction in the phosphorylation state of gsk3β was observed in cx43-deficient mice (ratio: 0.15 ± 0.02 vs. 0.56 ± 0.11, 0.77 ± 0.15, and 0.46 ± 0.14, respectively, n = 5–6, p < 0.01). furthermore, ischemic preconditioning (ipc, 4 cycles of 3.5 min of ischemia and 5 min of reperfusion) increased phosphorylation of erk-1/2, gsk3β, and stat3 in all hearts without differences between groups (n = 5–6, p < 0.05), although cx43 deficient mice were not protected by either ipc or pharmacological preconditioning with diazoxide. our data demonstrate that modification of risk and safe signaling does not contribute to the role of cx43 in the increased tolerance to myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury and in preconditioning protection. activation of several protein kinases occurs during myocardial ischaemia and during subsequent reperfusion. in contrast to the intensive investigation into the significance of kinase activation in cardioprotection, relatively little is known about the role of the phosphatases in this regard. the aim of this study was to re-evaluate the putative roles of pp1 and pp2a in ischaemia/reperfusion and in triggering ischaemic preconditioning. isolated perfused working rat hearts were subjected to sustained global (15 or 20 min) or regional ischaemia (35 min), followed by reperfusion. hearts were preconditioned using global ischaemia (1 × 5 or 3 × 5 min, alternated with 5 min reperfusion). to inhibit both pp1 and pp2a cantharidin (5 μm) was used. to inhibit pp2a only, okadaic acid (7.5 nm) was used. the drugs were administered during the preconditioning protocol, before onset of sustained ischaemia (pretreatment) or during reperfusion. endpoints were mechanical recovery during reperfusion, infarct size and activation of pkb/akt, p38 mapk and erk p42/p44, as determined by western blot. pretreatment of hearts with okadaic acid or cantharidin caused a significant reduction in mechanical recovery after 15 or 20 min global ischaemia. administration of the drugs during an ischaemic preconditioning protocol abolished functional recovery during reperfusion and significantly increased infarct size. administration of the drugs during reperfusion had no deleterious effects and increased functional recovery in 3 × pc hearts. to find an explanation for the differential effects of the inhibitors depending on the time of administration, hearts were freeze-clamped at different time points during the perfusion protocol. administration of cantharidin before 5 min ischaemia activated all kinases. subsequent reperfusion for 5 min without the drug maintained activation of the kinases until the onset of sustained ischaemia. cantharidin given during preconditioning was associated with activation of p38mapk and pkb/akt during reperfusion after sustained ischaemia. however, administration of the drug during reperfusion only after sustained ischaemia caused activation of both pkb/akt and erk p42/p44. phosphatase inhibition immediately prior to the onset of sustained ischaemia or during preconditioning abolishes protection during reperfusion, while inhibition of these enzymes during reperfusion either had no effect or enhanced the cardioprotective effects of preconditioning. it is proposed that inhibition of phosphatases during reperfusion may prolong the period of risk activation and hence protect the heart.
cataract affects 1 in 6 americans over the age of 40, and represents a global health problem. mature onset cataract is associated with the aggregation of partially unfolded or damaged proteins in the lens, which accumulate as an individual ages. currently, surgery is the primary effective treatment for cataract. as an alternative preventive approach, small molecules have been suggested as potential therapeutic agents. in this work, we study the effect of sodium citrate on the stability of human γd crystallin (hγd-crys), a structural protein of the eye lens, and two cataract-related mutants, l5s hγd-crys and i90f hγd-crys. in equilibrium unfolding-refolding studies, the presence of 250 mm sodium citrate increased the transition midpoint of the n-terminal domain (n-td) of wt hγd-crys and l5s hγd-crys by 0.3 m guhcl, the c-terminal domain (c-td) by 0.6 m guhcl, and the single transition of i90f hγd-crys by 0.4 m guhcl. in kinetic unfolding reactions, sodium citrate stabilization effect was observed only for the mutant i90f hγd-crys. in the presence of citrate, a kinetic unfolding intermediate of i90f hγd-crys was observed, which was not populated in the absence of citrate. the rates of aggregation were measured using solution turbidity. sodium citrate demonstrated negligible effect on rate of aggregation of wt hγd-crys, but considerably slowed the rate of aggregation of both l5s hγd-crys and i90f hγd-crys. the presence of sodium citrate dramatically slowed refolding of wt hγd-crys and i90f hγd-crys, but had a significantly smaller effect on the refolding of l5s hγd-crys. the differential stabilizing effect of sodium citrate suggests that the ion is binding to a partially unfolded conformation of the c-td, but a solution-based hofmeister effect cannot be eliminated as a possible explanation for the effects observed. these results indicate that assessment of potential anti-cataract agents needs to include effects on the unfolding and aggregation pathways, as well as the native state. data are reported for tm, the temperature midpoint of the thermal unfolding curve, of ribonuclease a, versus ph (range 2–9) and salt concentration (range 0–1 m) for two salts, na2so4 and nacl. the results show stabilization by sulfate via anion‐specific binding in the concentration range 0–0.1 m and via the hofmeister effect in the concentration range 0.1–1.0 m. the increase in tm caused by anion binding at 0.1 m sulfate is 20° at ph 2 but only 1° at ph 9, where the net proton charge on the protein is near 0. the 10° increase in tm between 0.1 and 1.0 m na2so4, caused by the hofmeister effect, is independent of ph. a striking property of the nacl results is the absence of any significant stabilization by 0.1 m nacl, which indicates that any debye screening is small. ph‐dependent stabilization is produced by 1 m nacl: the increase in tm between 0 and 1.0 m is 14° at ph 2 but only 1° at ph 9. the 14° increase at ph 2 may result from anion binding or from both binding and debye screening. taken together, the results for na2so4 and nacl show that native ribonuclease a is stabilized at low ph in the same manner as molten globule forms of cytochrome c and apomyoglobin, which are stabilized at low ph by low concentrations of sulfate but only by high concentrations of chloride.
this study investigated performance and physiology to understand pacing strategies in elite paralympic athletes with cerebral palsy (cp). six paralympic athletes with cp and 13 able‐bodied (ab) athletes performed two trials of eight sets of 10 shuttles (total 1600m). one trial was distance‐deceived (dec, 1000 m + 600 m) one trial was nondeceived (n‐dec, 1600 m). time (s), heart rate (hr, bpm), ratings of perceived exertion (rpe, units), and electromyography of five bilateral muscles (emg) were recorded for each set of both trials. the cp group ran slower than the ab group, and pacing differences were seen in the cp dec trial, presenting as a flat pacing profile over the trial (p < 0.05). hr was higher and rpe was lower in the cp group in both trials (p < 0.05). emg showed small differences between groups, sides, and trials. the present study provides evidence for a possible pacing strategy underlying exercise performance and fatigue in cp. the results of this study show (1) underperformance of the cp group, and (2) altered pacing strategy utilization in the cp group. we proposed that even at high levels of performance, the residual effects of cp may negatively affect performance through selection of conservative pacing strategies during exercise. the studies of amann et al. (2006, 2007) conclude that feedback from fatiguing skeletal muscle during exercise at different reduces central motor output to the working muscles “in order to reinvent excessive development of peripheral muscle fatigue beyond a critical threshold or sensory tolerance limit” (amann et al. 2006, p. 950). we suggest that their findings can be better explained by hypoxia-induced changes in central motor output acting in an anticipatory manner.
infantile anorexia (ia), defined by the diagnostic classification of mental health and developmental disorders of infancy and early childhood revised (dc: 0-3r, zero to three, 2005), occurs when the child (a) refuses to eat adequate amounts of food for at least 1 month, and shows growth deficiency, (b) does not communicate hunger and lacks interest in food, and (c) the child’s food refusal does not follow a traumatic event and is not due to an underlying medical illness. ia usually emerges during the transition to self-feeding, when the child issues of autonomy are played out daily in the feeding situation. studies evidence that the feeding interactions between children with ia and their mothers are characterized by low reciprocity, greater interactional conflict and negative affects (chatoor et al., 2000; ammaniti et al., 2010, 2012). moreover, these studies pointed out that maternal depression and eating disorders are frequently associated with ia (cooper et al., 2004; ammaniti et al., 2010; lucarelli et al., 2013). to date, research has focused almost exclusively on the mother–child dyad, while fathers’ involvement, co-parental and family interactions are poorly studied. the current study is a pilot research that investigated mother–father–child triadic interactions, during feeding and play, in families with children diagnosed with ia, in comparison to families with normally developing children. until now, at the study participated n = 10 families (five with a child with ia diagnosis and five with lack of child’s ia diagnosis, matched for child’s age and gender). the parents–child triadic interactions were assessed in feeding and play contexts using the lausanne trilogue play (fivaz-depeursinge and corboz-warnery, 1999), adapted to observe father-mother-infant primary triangle in the feeding context, compared to the play context (lucarelli et al., 2012). families of the ia-group showed difficulties in expressing and sharing pleasure and positive affects, and in structuring a predictable and flexible context. children showed little autonomy and difficulty in being actively engaged and tune with parents. dysfunctional family interactions are a critical issue for ia that affects co-parental and family subsystems, stressing the importance of an articulated diagnostic assessment in order to target effective treatment approaches. objective the aim of this study was to examine the differences among three subtypes of feeding disorders (fd), defined through the criteria of the dc:0-3r: "infantile anorexia" (ia), "feeding disorder associated with insults to the gastrointestinal tract" (fdigt), and "sensory food aversions" (sfa), by exploring mother-child interactions during feeding, children's temperament and emotional-adaptive functioning, and mothers' psychological profile and eating attitudes.   method the sample consisted of 146 italian mother-child pairs, of which 51 children with ia, 47 children with fdigt, and 48 mothers and their children with sfa. all dyads were videotaped during feeding; mothers completed questionnaires assessing their psychological profiles and eating attitudes, as well as their children's temperament and emotional/behavioral functioning.   results analyses revealed significant differences between the diagnostic groups of fd in relation to mother-child interactions during feeding, children's temperament and emotional-adaptive functioning, and mothers' psychological profile and eating attitudes.   discussion both interactional and individual variables may contribute differently to specific fd and outcomes during childhood. definitions by fd subtypes, using operational diagnostic criteria, and the assessment of mother-child interactions are relevant to target interventions strategies to treat specific disorders.
repression designates coping strategies such as avoidance, or denial that aim to shield the organism from threatening stimuli. derakshan et al. have proposed the vigilance-avoidance theory of repressive coping. it is assumed that repressors have an initial rapid vigilant response triggering physiological responses to threat stimuli. in the following second stage repressors manifest avoidant cognitive biases. functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3t was used to study neural correlates of repressive coping during the first stages of perception of threat. pictures of human faces bearing fearful, angry, happy and neutral expressions were briefly presented masked by neutral faces. forty study participants (20 repressive and 20 sensitizing individuals) were selected from a sample of 150 female students on the basis of their scores on the mainz coping inventory. repressors exhibited stronger neural activation than sensitizers primarily in response to masked threatening faces (vs neutral baseline) in the frontal, parietal and temporal cortex as well as in the cingulate gyrus, basal ganglia and insula. there was no brain region in which sensitizers showed increased activation to emotion expression compared to repressors. the present results are in line with the vigilance-avoidance theory which predicts heightened automatic responsivity to threatening stimuli in repression. this research project posits a model of repression that incorporates both repressive personality and repressive social behavior. the 1st parameter of the model specifies the motivation for repressors' distancing of themselves from emotional events. experiment 1 demonstrates that repressors are hypersensitive--in their cognitive attention--to both negative and positive emotional events. the 2nd parameter of the model specifies the conditions under which repressors distance themselves from emotional events. experiments 2 and 3 demonstrate that repressors psychologically distance themselves when the situation threatens their self-evaluation and provides opportunity for them to attend to and process self-relevant and non-self-relevant information. this 2-factor model extends the current conceptualization of repression in that it identifies motivation (dispositional emotional sensitivity) and context (situational threats to self-evaluation and distraction availability) for repressors' distancing of themselves from negative and positive emotional events.
there has been an increasing interest in white matter abnormalities in patients with anorexia nervosa (an). however, to date, there have been only a few diffusion tensor imaging (dti) studies investigating an, and the results are inconsistent. in this study, we employed tract-based spatial statistics (tbss), a robust technique for whole-brain analysis of dti data, to detect white matter abnormalities in an patients compared with healthy controls. seventeen women with an and 18 age matched healthy women were included. the mean body mass index of patients was 13.6 kg/m(2) (controls: 19.9 kg/m(2)). dti data were acquired on a 3-tesla magnetic resonance imaging system. fractional anisotropy (fa) and mean diffusivity (md) maps were calculated from the dti data of each patient, and voxel-wise group comparisons of fa and md were performed using tbss. compared with the healthy comparisons, the patients showed a significantly higher md value in the fornix and lower fa value in the left cerebellum. we also found significant positive correlations between the mean fa value of the left cerebellar hemisphere cluster and bmi, as well as between the mean md value of the cluster in the anterior body of the fornix and the duration of illness. the results suggest that the white matter abnormalities in the fornix and the cerebellum may be related to the pathophysiology of an. the eating disorder anorexia nervosa (an) is associated with high anxiety. the brain mechanisms that drive those behaviors are unknown. in this study we wanted to test whether brain white matter (wm) integrity is altered in an, and related to heightened anxiety. sixteen adult women with an (mean age 24 ± 7 years) and 17 healthy control women (cw, mean age 25 ± 4 years) underwent diffusion tensor imaging (dti) of the brain. the dti brain images were used to calculate the fractional anisotropy (fa) of wm tracts, which is a measure for wm integrity. an individuals compared to cw showed clusters of significantly reduced fa (p<0.05, corrected) in the bilateral fimbria-fornix and the fronto-occipital fasciculus, as well as the posterior cingulum wm. in the an group, harm avoidance was predicted by fa in the left and right fimbria-fornix. those findings were not due to wm volume deficits in an. this study indicates that wm integrity is abnormal in an in limbic and association pathways, which could contribute to disturbed feeding, emotion processing and body perception in an. the prediction of harm avoidance in an by fimbria-fornix wm integrity suggests that this pathway may be mechanistically involved in high anxiety in an.
a sensitive immunohistochemical technique was used, along with highly specific affinity-purified antibodies to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf), to generate a detailed mapping of bdnf immunoreactivity (bdnf-ir) throughout the adult rat cns. a parallel analysis of sites of bdnf synthesis was performed with in situ hybridization techniques using a crna probe to the exon encoding mature rat bdnf protein. these combined data revealed (1) groups of cell bodies containing diffuse bdnf-ir throughout the cns that were strongly correlated with fields of cells containing bdnf mrna; (2) varying degrees of bdnf-ir outside of cell bodies, in what appeared to be fibers and/or terminals; and (3) many regions containing extremely heavy bdnf-immunoreactive fiber/terminal labeling that lacked bdnf mrna (e.g., medial habenula, central nucleus of the amygdala, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, lateral septum, and spinal cord). the latter observation suggested that in these regions bdnf was derived from anterograde axonal transport by afferent systems. in the two cases in which this hypothesis was tested by the elimination of select afferents, bdnf immunostaining was completely eliminated. these data, along with the observation that bdnf-ir was rarely found within dendrites or fibers en passage, suggest that bdnf protein produced in adult cns neurons is polarized primarily along axonal processes and is preferentially stored in terminals within the innervation target. the site and regulation of neurotrophic factor release from neurons is poorly understood. we used a combination of model cell lines and primary culture systems to study the polarity of bdnf sorting and the regulation of its release from hippocampal neurons. transfection and expression of a human bdnf cdna in a mouse pituitary cell line, att20, resulted in the colocalization of bdnf with the secretory granule marker, chromogranin a. furthermore, stimulation of these cells with 56 mm kcl or with 5 mm 8-bromo-camp increased the release of bdnf approximately 10-to 15-fold within 30 min. to study bdnf release from primary cultures of hippocampal neurons, cells were infected with a defective herpes simplex viral (hsv) vector expressing human bdnf. depolarizing conditions increased the release of bdnf 5-fold from these cells, further verifying that secretion is regulated. immunocytochemical analysis using highly specific antibodies determined that endogenous bdnf was predominantly localized to the somatodentritic domain of hippocampal neurons. these findings support the view that bdnf functions as a target-derived signal for afferents to hippocampal pyramidal cells and that it may serve as a regulator of hippocampal plasticity.
background the purpose of the current study was to determine the effects of preoperative cigarette smoking and the carbon monoxide level in the exhaled breath on perioperative respiratory complications in patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomies.   methods one hundred and fifty two patients (smokers, group s and non-smokers, group ns), who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomies under general anesthesia, were studied. patients completed the fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence. the preoperative carbon monoxide level in the exhaled breath levels were determined using the pico+smokerlyzer 12h before surgery. respiratory complications were recorded during induction of anesthesia, intraoperatively, during extubation, and in the recovery room.   results statistically significant increases were noted in group s with respect to the incidence of hypoxia during induction of anesthesia, intraoperative bronchospasm, bronchodilator treatment intraoperatively, and bronchospasm during extubation. the carbon monoxide level in the exhaled breath and the fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence, and number of cigarettes smoked 12h preoperatively were designated as covariates in the regression model. logistic regression analysis of anesthetic induction showed that a 1 unit increase in the carbon monoxide level in the exhaled breath level was associated with a 1.16 fold increase in the risk of hypoxia (or=1.16; 95% ci 1.01-1.34; p=0.038). logistic regression analysis of the intraoperative course showed that a 1 unit increase in the number of cigarettes smoked 12h preoperatively was associated with a 1.16 fold increase in the risk of bronchospasm (or=1.16; 95% ci 1.04-1.30; p=0.007). while in the recovery room, a 1 unit increase in the fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence score resulted in a 1.73 fold increase in the risk of bronchospasm (or=1.73; 95% ci 1.04-2.88; p=0.036).   conclusions cigarette smoking was shown to increase the incidence of intraoperative respiratory complications while under general anesthesia. moreover, the estimated preoperative carbon monoxide level in the exhaled breath level may serve as an indicator of the potential risk of perioperative respiratory complications. objective to determine the impact of smoking on the rate of pulmonary and upper respiratory complications following laparoscopic gynecologic surgery.   methods we retrospectively identified all patients who underwent laparoscopic gynecologic surgery at one institution between january 2000 and january 2009. pulmonary and upper respiratory complications were defined as atelectasis, pneumonia, upper respiratory infection, acute respiratory failure, hypoxemia, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum occurring within 30 days after surgery   results nine hundred three patients underwent attempt at laparoscopic surgery. fifty-four were excluded because of conversion to laparotomy and 31 because of insufficient data. of the 818 patients included, 356 (43%) had cancer. a total of 576 (70%) patients were never smokers, 156 (19%) were past smokers, and 86 (10%) were current smokers (smoked within 6 weeks before surgery). these three groups were similar with regard to median body mass index, operative time, and length of hospital stay. compared to never and past smokers, current smokers were more likely to undergo high-complexity laparoscopic procedures (10.4%, 15.4%, and 19.8%, respectively; p=0.015) and had younger median age 49 years, 51 years, and 46 years, respectively; p=0.035. nineteen (2.3%) patients experienced pulmonary complications - symptomatic atelectasis (n=9), pneumonia (n=5), acute respiratory failure (n=2), hypoxemia (n=1), pneumomediastinum (n=1), and pneumothorax (n=2). the rate of pulmonary complications was 2.1% (12 of 564 patients) in never smokers, 4.5% (7 of 156 patients) in past smokers, and zero in current smokers.   conclusion in this cohort, smoking history did not appear to impact postoperative pulmonary and upper respiratory complications. in smokers scheduled for operative procedures, laparoscopy should be considered when feasible.
backgroundtype 2 diabetes mellitus (dm) is the most common type of diabetes.the number of patients with this disease is expected torise in future. given the increasing prevalence of diabetes, there is an urgent need for the treatment of diabetes and the associated complications. glycemic control largely depends on compliance with medication therapies. in fact, the most common problem in patients with diabetes is lack of medication compliance. this study aimed to determine the relationship between affectivetemperaments and medication compliance in patients with type 2 diabetes.methodsin this cross-sectional research, the study population consisted of all patients referring to the endocrinology clinic of ayatollah taleghani hospital of tehran in 2010 and 2011. two hundreds and seven patients were selected, using available sampling method. in this study, we used temperament evaluation of memphis, pisa, paris, and san diego auto questionnaire (temps-a), a single-item scale of medication compliance, beck depression inventory-ii (bdi-ii), and a researcher-made questionnaire to assess the patients' demographic information. all participants completed the questionnaires related to affective temperaments, medication compliance, depression and demographic information. the obtained data were recorded on the prepared sheets.resultsof 207 patients, 79 (38.2%) and 128 (61.8%) subjects were male and female, respectively. the mean and standard deviation of demographic data were calculated. in total, 13.5%, 19.3%, and 8.2%of the participants had mild, moderate, and severe depression, respectively. in this study, as the single-item rating scale indicated, medication compliance and non-compliance were reported in 75.4% and 24.6% of the patients, respectively. among the demographic characteristics and clinical variables, frequency of patient referral and glycated hemoglobin level were predictors of medication compliance. also, among affective temperaments, irritable temperament was a predictor of medication compliance.conclusionsthe obtained findings emphasize the importance of psychological factors such as personality characteristics in medication compliance of patients with diabetes. in case a patient obtains high scores in irritable temperament (which indicate poor medication compliance), he/she should follow special training programs to improve his/her medication compliance. background in non-diabetic populations, anxious and depressive affective temperaments are associated with stress and distress disorders (anxious and depressive). in type 2 diabetes, distress with diabetes and distress disorders have been associated with metabolic control. there are few studies undertaken on temperament and metabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. the aim of our study was to examine the independent association between affective temperaments and metabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.   methods the sample included 90 patients with type 2 diabetes from two outpatient clinics aged 53.54 (sd ± 8.05) years and with 66.7% female gender. depression was evaluated by using the madrs observer rating scale (mean value: 16.38 ± 11).   results patients with excessive depressive and anxious temperaments had more depressive symptoms, worse psychological adjustment to diabetes and worse metabolic control. in logistic regression (crude model), only depressive temperament was independently associated with metabolic control.   conclusions affective temperaments are associated with psychological adjustment to diabetes and metabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. patients above threshold on depressive temperament should be considered for greater scrutiny and psycho-education by the diabetes clinic staff.
aims:  to determine the ability of probiotic lactobacilli to improve the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (vvc) using a randomized, double‐blind and placebo‐controlled trial. vulvovaginal candidasis (vvc) is a common disease. the majority of cases is caused by candida albicans, but in recent years an increase has been observed in the frequency of non‐albicans candida infections, especially due to c. glabrata and c. tropicalis. the aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of non‐albicans candida infections in patients suffering from vvc. therefore, the statistical data of culture‐confirmed vvc ascertained at the institute of hygiene (medical university graz) have been studied. altogether, 10 463 samples from patients with vulvovaginal complaints were analysed in the years 2000–2004, a number of 3184 proved to be culture‐positive for yeast. candida albicans was the most prevalent cause in 87.9% of all cases. non‐albicans candida yeast were detected in 12.1%, mainly c. glabrata and saccharomyces cerevisiae. during a 1‐year period 185 patients showed more than one episode of vvc. patients aged 21–40 years were significantly more prone to suffer from vvc compared with other age‐related groups.
different speech sounds evoke unique patterns of activity in primary auditory cortex (a1). behavioral discrimination by rats is well correlated with the distinctness of the a1 patterns evoked by individual consonants, but only when precise spike timing is preserved. in this study we recorded the speech-evoked responses in the primary, anterior, ventral, and posterior auditory fields of the rat and evaluated whether activity in these fields is better correlated with speech discrimination ability when spike timing information is included or eliminated. spike timing information improved consonant discrimination in all four of the auditory fields examined. behavioral discrimination was significantly correlated with neural discrimination in all four auditory fields. the diversity of speech responses across recordings sites was greater in posterior and ventral auditory fields compared with a1 and anterior auditor fields. these results suggest that, while the various auditory fields of the rat process speech sounds differently, neural activity in each field could be used to distinguish between consonant sounds with accuracy that closely parallels behavioral discrimination. earlier observations in the visual and somatosensory systems that cortical neurons do not rely on spike timing should be reevaluated with more complex natural stimuli to determine whether spike timing contributes to sensory encoding. the rat auditory cortex is divided anatomically into several areas, but little is known about the functional differences in information processing between these areas. to determine the filter properties of rat posterior auditory field (paf) neurons, we compared neurophysiological responses to simple tones, frequency modulated (fm) sweeps, and amplitude modulated noise and tones with responses of primary auditory cortex (a1) neurons. paf neurons have excitatory receptive fields that are on average 65% broader than a1 neurons. the broader receptive fields of paf neurons result in responses to narrow and broadband inputs that are stronger than a1. in contrast to a1, we found little evidence for an orderly topographic gradient in paf based on frequency. these neurons exhibit latencies that are twice as long as a1. in response to modulated tones and noise, paf neurons adapt to repeated stimuli at significantly slower rates. unlike a1, neurons in paf rarely exhibit facilitation to rapidly repeated sounds. neurons in paf do not exhibit strong selectivity for rate or direction of narrowband one octave fm sweeps. these results indicate that paf, like nonprimary visual fields, processes sensory information on larger spectral and longer temporal scales than primary cortex.
introduction hypoglycemia is a defining feature of severe malaria and several other infectious diseases in children but the prevalence, significance, and prognosis of abnormal blood glucose, including hyperglycemia, have rarely been addressed in severely ill children in non-malaria endemic areas. methods in madagascar, consecutive children (1 month-15 years) admitted to the pediatric ward of a referral hospital, were categorized using the integrated management of childhood illness (imci). samples were taken once on admission for measuring blood glucose concentration. glycemia levels (hypoglycemia <2.2 mmol/l; low glycemia: 2.2–4.4 mmol/l; normoglycemia >4.4–8.3 mmol/l; and hyperglycemia >8.3 mmol/l) were related to the imci algorithm and case fatality. factors associated with blood glucose concentration and case fatality were analysed using univariate and multivariate analysis. results of 420 children, 48.1% (n = 202) were severely ill; 3.1% (n = 13) had hypoglycemia; 20.0% (n = 84) low glycemia; 65.9% (n = 277) normoglycemia; and 10.9% (n = 46) hyperglycemia. in univariate analysis, hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia both showed significant increase in the risk of death, as compared to normal blood glucose (rr: 12.2, 95% ci: 6.2–23.7 and rr: 2.5, 95% ci: 1.0–6.2, respectively). children with low glycemia had no increased risk of death (rr: 1.2, 95% ci: 0.4–3.2) despite a poorer imci status on admission. after logistic regression, hypoglycemia (rr: 19.4, 95% ci: 5.0–.74.7, hepatomegaly (rr: 12.2, 95% ci: 3.3–44.9) and coma (rr: 4.8, 95% ci: 1.3–17.6) were the features on admission associated with an increased risk of death. conclusions dysglycemia in non-neonates is associated with increased mortality. these findings underline the need for the use of rapid screening tests to initiate early treatment. alternative treatments such as oral or sublingual administration of glucose should be developed in structures with limited resources. transient hyperglycemia occurs as a part of stress response in acute illnesses and is brought about by elevated levels of counter regulatory hormones. it is frequently encountered but the exact prevalence and implications, especially in childhood have not been studied in detail. 758 children (1 month to 6 years) with acute illness were screened for hyperglycemia; of these 36 children were found to have a glucose level of ≥150 mg/dl at admission and were designated hyperglycemics. the overall prevalence of hyperglycemia was 4.7 per cent. the disease-wise prevalence in neurological disorders, septicemia, respiratory illnesses and diarrhoea was 7.9, 7.6, 4.2 and 3.0 per cent respectively. family history of diabetes did not predispose towards developing transient hyperglycemia. the demographic profile (age, sex, nutrition status and disease pattern) and severity of illness (as assessed by temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, duration of illness and hospitalization, treatment modalities required, hypoxia and acidosis) did not affect the prevalence, extent and the rate of normalization of hyperglycemia. the mortality in hyperglycemics was double (13.9%) as compared to 6.9% in non-hyperglycemics, although the difference was insignificant, statistically (o.r=2.17, ci=0.81–5.82, p>0.05). it was, therefore, concluded that transient hyperglycemia occurs in 4–5% of patients with acute pediatric illnesses. however, it does not significantly correlate with the clinical profile and severity of the illness, and has no immediate prognostic significance.
mice of background dba/2j are hyporesponsive to the behavioral effects of d-amphetamine in comparison with the widely exploited murine background c57bl/6j. in view of the important role of dopamine (da) release in the nucleus accumbens (nac) regarding the behavioral effects of psychostimulants, we tested the hypothesis of an inverse relationship between mesocortical and mesoaccumbens da functioning in the two backgrounds. systemic d-amphetamine induces a sustained increase in da release in the medial prefrontal cortex (mpfc) accompanied by a poor increase in the nac in mice of the low-responsive dba/2j background, as shown by intracerebral microdialysis in freely moving animals. the opposite occurs in c57bl/6j mice, which show low prefrontal cortical da outflow accompanied by high accumbal extracellular da. moreover, the dba/2j background showed lower locomotor activity than c57bl/6j mice following d-amphetamine challenge. selective da depletion in the mpfc of dba/2j mice produced a clear-cut increase in d-amphetamine-induced da outflow in the nac as well as locomotor activity that reached levels similar to those observed in c57bl/6j mice. finally, local infusion of d-amphetamine by reverse microdialysis produced a similar increase in extracellular da in both the mpfc and the nac of dba/2j mice. this finding points to similar transporter-related mechanisms in the two brain areas and supports the hypothesis that low accumbal da release induced by systemic d-amphetamine in the dba/2j background is determined by the inhibitory action of prefrontal cortical da. the present results indicate that genotype-dependent susceptibility to addictive properties of d-amphetamine involves unbalanced da transmission in the mesocorticolimbic system. article de synthese sur le reseau dopaminergique mesocorticolimbique chez les mammiferes. synthese sur les caracteristiques fonctionnelles des projections dopaminergiques: striatum, cortex, systeme limbique. synthese sur le fonctionnement et la regulation de ce reseau dans le cerveau en fonction du comportement et en fonction de l'individu
the current study examined the role of perceived social isolation in moderating the effects of oxytocin on cardiac autonomic control in humans. intranasal administration of 20 iu oxytocin resulted in a significant increase in autonomic (parasympathetic and sympathetic) cardiac control. specifically, oxytocin increased high frequency heart rate variability, a relatively pure measure of parasympathetic cardiac control, and decreased pre-ejection period, a well-validated marker of enhanced sympathetic cardiac control. derived metrics of autonomic co-activity and reciprocity revealed that oxytocin significantly increased overall autonomic cardiac control. furthermore, the effects of oxytocin on cardiac autonomic control were significantly associated with loneliness ratings. higher levels of loneliness were associated with diminished parasympathetic cardiac reactivity to intranasal oxytocin. the effects of ot on autonomic cardiac control were independent of any effects on circulating pro-inflammatory cytokine or stress hormone levels. thus, lonely individuals may be less responsive to the salubrious effects of oxytocin on cardiovascular responsivity. background in nonhuman mammals, the neuropeptide oxytocin has repeatedly been shown to increase social approach behavior and pair bonding. in particular, central nervous oxytocin reduces behavioral and neuroendocrine responses to social stress and is suggested to mediate the rewarding aspects of attachment in highly social species. however, to date there have been no studies investigating the effects of central oxytocin mechanisms on behavior and physiology in human couple interaction.   methods in a double-blind placebo-controlled design, 47 heterosexual couples (total n = 94) received oxytocin or placebo intranasally before a standard instructed couple conflict discussion in the laboratory. the conflict session was videotaped and coded for verbal and nonverbal interaction behavior (e.g., eye contact, nonverbal positive behavior, and self-disclosure). salivary cortisol was repeatedly measured during the experiment.   results oxytocin significantly increased positive communication behavior in relation to negative behavior during the couple conflict discussion (f = 4.18, p = .047) and significantly reduced salivary cortisol levels after the conflict compared with placebo (f = 7.14, p = .011).   conclusions these results are in line with animal studies indicating that central oxytocin facilitates approach and pair bonding behavior. our findings imply an involvement of oxytocin in couple interaction and close relationships in humans.
